            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. As I was saying, Madam President, Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi has been detained in Arusha since June 2001, and we have been assigned to shoulder the heavy burden of his defence. Madam President, as a result of this, we have called upon investigators and assistants, and thus, on the 3rd of November 2001, Mr. Aimable Sungura was assigned as the main investigator to our trial. But as you know, investigators who work for the Tribunal are not professional investigators, well, at least, as far as the person whose name I have just mentioned is concerned, he conducted investigations on the ground and when faced with the difficulties, I asked and was able to obtain that he be assisted by another investigator who had more experience and who had just completed a case before the Tribunal. And this person had a great deal of experience and thus, would be able to assist our team. His name was Aloys Nyilingondo. He was assigned on the 29th of October 2002. However, Madam President, even though my team has been -- although my team has been assigned, we have faced some difficulties. We have not been able to go on mission. I sent a work program on the 22nd of October in order to travel to Kigali and to see myself the site for which my client has been incriminated. We filed a plan on the 22nd of October, where we've received no reaction, we received no response until January 2002 - or, rather, 2003, to receive a program for us to be able to travel to Kigali. On the 26th of May - or, rather, March 2002 -- or 2003, I wrote an order to relaunch this program of work, but that still has not been implemented. In the meantime, I wrote to the section that deals with the processing of counsel's request, I said this situation is abnormal; my teams is blocked, I do not understand what is happening. By preventing us from travelling on mission and working does not allow us to proceed in a proper manner. And therefore, I would like to request that we be allowed to go into the field and thus ensure Gacumbitsi's defence. Madam President, there was no follow-up, no response from them. And it wasn't until the 27th of March 2003, that the work program for Kigali would be approved. Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I fell ill just as I was about to travel to Kigali. This is unfortunate, but I shall continue. I am now filing this motion to say that I am ill and that my client has complained because I have not been able to come and see him in Arusha because I was only allowed two trips. I arrived here in May to meet with my client. I am accompanied by my assistant and as soon as I arrived here on the 17th or 18th, I was told, "Oh it is for good, could you please participate in an informal status conference, your arrival is quite opportune." I do not believe much in this type of informal meetings because I raised the problems that during the last 10 months, on the 23rd of May, and since October, we have not been able to go on mission. And the motion that you have received since the 22nd, and you have a copy in front of you, you will see that I have forgotten to mention a very important event. Nyilingondo was assigned in October, and up until June of 2003 he would not have been able to go to mission. Why? I don't know. Once again, Madam President, I raise these problems during the meeting. At that point after the meeting of the 23rd, my missions are approved for the 27th of May for my investigators to go out into the field on the 27th of May. And because I have to take a ticket to make my reservations, I left on the 28th of May. And I am convinced that as of the 1st, my two investigators would be able to go out into the field. Unfortunately, once again they have to face difficulties in meeting this program. They have problems obtaining visas and transport and people have not been able since October 2002. So, it wasn't until the 3rd and the 5th of July that they would be able to leave Arusha to go to travel initially to the refugee camps in Tanzania, then to Malawi. Unfortunately, the persons contacted in 2001 have been repatriated, others have died and others still have moved for reasons of safety. In June 2003 my investigators, basically, are at the same point as we were at the beginning when I was first assigned in 2001. And nevertheless, I come back here in June 2003 and at that point I hear that my presence is required on the 7th, but no one telephoned me; no one sent me a mail or a fax.

            <p>I'm sorry, Madam President. Thank you for these comments. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for your comments. As I was saying, Madam President, so I arrived in Arusha in June. And when I arrived, there is a piece of paper stuck on the wall saying, "Counsel Kouengoua, we need you." On the 7th, I was on the plane and arrived on the 8th, but I didn't know that I was expected to attend to meeting. In any case, it is decided that this other meeting will be held on the 10th. And I participated in the meeting. I lay out the problems that I have had to face. And there seems to be a general consensus because it is said; "What do you think you can do to be ready by the 28th of July? Do you need additional staff? What do you need?" And I think, Madam President, that at the time, all of those who participated in the meeting agreed to the recommendations that were made by the President of the Tribunal. He was assisted by other eminent Judges. So we left the room. On the 11th, I wrote a letter to my section stating that despite the problems we had to face, because I told you that the investigators still had not been able to move forward because when I sat in the meeting on the 10th, they still had not returned. So I did not know what the results were going to be of their travels into the missions in the field. So I wrote on the 11th to say if that is the case and we had to have the trial on the 28th, I would like to request that I be assigned two assistants; one bi-lingual assistant, because during these different meetings, during the writing -- the documents that I sought to write, we always had to face the problem of translation with a short turn around. It was a problem I would like to say. You have seen this in the case. I have had to call upon translators found here and there, untrained personnel in order to respond to the requirements of the proceedings. Madam President, up until the 22nd, which is the date on which I filed my motion, I have received no response. Therefore, I am in a position in which I have had to file a motion before the Trial Chamber, so that you will understand the facts. I am not pointing a finger at anyone. I am just stating the facts. I am trying to say, Madam President, Your Honours, this is the situation I am faced with. These are the problems I have to deal with. This is what we would like to submit to you as a solution so that there can be a perfect equality of arms during the trial of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. Madam President, during these meetings we have also spoken of disclosure because - or, rather, of communication, Gacumbitsi speaks French; his counsel speaks French. And I believe the person who chaired these meetings said, couldn't any efforts be undertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor so that we could receive priority translations or even communication in French, that all of the documents dealing with Gacumbitsi's trial be disclosed to us in French, even short correspondence. The correspondence on the 24th of July, for example, is still in English. We have yet to receive French copies of these documents. This is not all, Madam President, even though it had been promised to me that at the end of May that I would receive certain documents, I would only receive them on the 25th of June as a CD-rom. And I was only able to view the CD-rom on the 15th of July. And there are 2046 pages of documents that I am meant to review to be ready by the 28th of July. I believe that is inhuman. And the physicians here in Arusha can certify that this pace is unacceptable. This is why I requested, Madam President, Your Honours, very respectfully that the Honourable Trial Chamber that you preside would be able to allow me additional time; that is, to move the dates of opening of trial back so that we don't open the 28th of July. This would allow me to provide an efficient and effective defence for Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. These were the reasons why we presented this motion. I wish to thank you.</p>

            <speaker>MR. WASTLAIN:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, I work within the Defence Counsel Section. My name is Laurent Wastelain. I have been there for a number of months. The person who is basically in charge of this section has been on leave for about a month. I am going to give you a neutral and objective answer to the best of my ability as regards the situation of the Defence team; first, the investigators and the work program which was sent down, and then the two assistants who were appointed, one, on the 23rd of July, whereas the application had been put in on the 11th of July. Let me start off with what concerns me. That is the appointment of the assistants. Indeed, on the 11th of July, Counsel Kouengoua put in an application for the appointment of two assistants, Mr. Gatamara <stage>(sic)</stage> and Mr. Tchoupou. I took the documents. And I believe it is important to underscore that communication from that point went on on a daily basis with Mr. Kouengoua. I think we should not leave aside the fact that after the conference, the status conference, we communicated on a daily basis to make it possible for Counsel Kouengoua to be ready for the opening of the trial on the 28th of July. Now, as regards the appointment of Mr. Gatamara, there was a problem because Mr. Gatamara was an investigator for another accused person before this Tribunal, who is Mr. Karera, and for whom the lead counsel was Ms. Marchessault. So, I informed Mr. Getamara, Tharcisse, that the section could not appoint an investigator - or, rather, an assistant without the approval of the counsel for whom he was working, taking into consideration the fact that there could be a conflict of interest and that the client of Counsel Marchessault might perhaps not agree with the appointment of Mr. Gatamara in the Gacumbitsi case. So on the 18th of July, I sent an e-mail to Counsel Marchessault asking if she agreed with the appointment of Mr. Gatamara. He -- she, rather, replied and said that she did give her approval, but that she wanted also to have the approval of her client to the appointment of Mr. Gatamara as an assistant in her case. She also wanted, as included in her e-mail, that she would like to organise, along with the detention facility, a visit between Mr. Gatamara and her client, Karera. The next day, I called the commander of the detention facility, who told me that he had reservations about the visit and that the lead counsel was instead suppose to call the client and inform him of the situation. So I got in touch with Madam Marchessault for her to get in touch with her client, so that the client could give his approval. On the 22nd of July, since we had not received any reply from Counsel Marchessault, we communicated by phone and I told her what the situation was. She told me that she was going to phone her client on the same day to obtain approval, and told me the next day that she contacted her client and the client approved the appointment of Mr. Gatamara in another case. The following day on the 20th, Mr. Gatamara was appointed as legal assistant, and Mr. Kouengoua was informed on the very day. Now, as regard to the appointment of the second assistant proposed by Mr. Kouengoua, who is Mr. Tchoupou, I examined Mr. Tchoupou's CV, and I recognised that he worked as an intern for the Office of the Prosecutor from September 2000 to February 2003. On the very day I received the application for appointment, I sent an e-mail to the Office of the Prosecutor to know if, indeed, first of all, Mr. Tchoupou had worked in a case that might cause any prejudice to the present case, and to find out if there were any reservations regarding the appointment of Mr. Tchoupou as an assistant for the Defence team. That was on the 18th of July. On the same day I received a reply stating that the Office of the Prosecutor had reservations because a conflict of interest might arise. I informed Counsel Kouengoua. I believe I tried to be as transparent as possible, as from the status conference I informed him of everything that I have just explained to you. I believe he is aware of the entire proceedings on a daily basis. So, the section decided not to appoint Mr. Tchoupou because that might lead to a conflict of interest. That is the situation. Now talking about investigations, it is difficult for me to justify the fact that there was no communication. And I note that Mr. Kouengoua did not receive a reply to many of the letters that he sent in. I think that the section was understaffed, and we were not able to make sure that there was effective communication between Mr. Kouengoua and the section. Nevertheless, I base myself on the requests for payments that were sent in for two investigators and assistants, Sungura and Aloys Nyilingondo. These are just facts and comments which might enlighten the Chamber. What I could say is that up to this point in time, 215 witnesses have been contacted and 72 witnesses have been heard. For Aloys Nyilingondo, the investigator, he has gone on three trips which were not necessarily authorized by the Defence Management Section, nevertheless, the missions were conducted. And he was able to meet 11 witnesses from the 19th to the 22nd of January, 2001. As for Aimable Surgura, he conducted -- or he went on about 28 trips, not talking about visits. And I would like to point out that all of these trips were not authorized. However, he saw over 200 witnesses and interviewed a number of them himself. Now regarding the state of preparedness of the Defence team, without trying to pass any judgement and trying to avoid any prejudices, what I could say before this Chamber is that Counsel Kouengoua, since he was appointed, he has applied for 2619 hours. For the entire Defence team up to 2000 -- May 2003, they have filed for 4900 hours. And we have 7,500 hours of preparation that have been billed in our Defence section. That is the situation, Madam President. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Good morning, Your Honour. My name is Jacqueline Crawford. I am the security and movement coordinator of WVSS-P, the section OIC, Mr. David Chappell is presently in Kigali on duty. I wish to inform the Court of what is happening so far with the witness support section regarding the witnesses who are here. Already we have 11 witnesses from Kigali, which includes three children under the age of 18 months. One of these witnesses has already committed himself to be here. He has taken off from his busy schedule to be here in Arusha to give evidence. If the hearing is delayed, these witnesses -- we can not guarantee these witnesses to return to Arusha again to give evidence. Also, this matter will be printed in the press, and these witnesses are exposed to risk. Already we have arrangements made for five witnesses who have been -- who are under the 90bis order. And they have already been scheduled to be here on Wednesday, the 30th of July. Special arrangements were made for these witnesses to be here. And it will be an embarrassment to the ICTR if these witnesses' schedule is cancelled. Also, it will be an embarrassment to the ICTR staff in Kigali if these witnesses are returned to Kigali without giving evidence. Lastly, we must look at the logistics involved in bringing these witnesses to Arusha. And they have to return to Rwanda without testifying. Thank you.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. I don't have much by way of a response, Your Honours. Counsel for the Defence, in a meeting on the 23rd of May this year, in a meeting presided over by the President of this Tribunal, Judge Eric Møse, was asked when he would be ready for trial, suggested that he would be ready for commencement of trial on the 14th of July 2003. At no point during the meeting, Your Honours, did Counsel raise the difficulties expressed in the current motion. In a subsequent meeting, Your Honours, presided over by Judge Møse, with Judges Egorov and Reddy in attendance, the only difficulty that Counsel expressed was that he would not be ready to commence the Defence case on the 6th of October, 2003. Counsel told the meeting that he needed more time, not for the commencement of the Prosecution case, but the commencement of the Defence case. At that point, Your Honours, Counsel was offered an extra investigator. And at the conclusion of the meeting, it was agreed that the trial would commence on the 28th of July, as initially scheduled. It is understandable, Your Honours, that Counsel has difficulty with the English language, but the Office of the Prosecutor has endeavoured to communicate and/or disclose material in the working language of Counsel. As of the 1st of July 2003, 22 witnesses' statements in unredacted form were filed with the registry for disclosure to the Accused and his Defence counsel. Contrary to what Counsel now alleges, Your Honours, subsequent to the 10th of July 2003, the Office of the Prosecutor had not disclosed any material. There is one letter inviting Counsel to inspect the exhibits that the Prosecutor intends to rely on in trial, and that is the only letter written to Counsel subsequent to the status conference of 11th of July. And in this letter we were only reminding Counsel of an earlier invitation to come and inspect Prosecutor's exhibits. It is clear from the pretrial brief filed on the 16th of May 2003 that the said exhibits were available for inspection both on the 23rd of May 2003 and on the 10th of July 2003. During the meetings presided over by Judge Møse, Counsel was reminded of the invitation to inspect. With regard, Your Honours, to the Prosecutor's 92bis motion for the admission onto the record of the testimony of Alison Des Forges in the Akayesu trial, contrary to what Counsel alleges, the testimony was disclosed to Counsel in both languages; that is, English and French. And the transcript is only 900 pages. And as you would have seen, Your Honours, it is 900 pages of double-spaced, 25-line a full sheet. Prosecutor wishes to note, Your Honours that Counsel was assigned and took instructions for this case in October 2001. It is now almost two years since he accepted this brief. We have learned from the Defence Counsel Management Section that 215 potential Defence witnesses have been contacted; 72 have been interviewed. And that to date Counsel's billings stand at an aggregate of 15,000 hours. We submit, Your Honours, that Counsel has had adequate time, has been given adequate facilities, and that he should, therefore, be ready to proceed with the trial. I wish to underscore, Your Honours, that the scheduling of this trial was done by consent of the parties. Detailed logistics have been undertaken to ensure the presence in Arusha of witnesses. As you have heard, there are currently 11 witnesses, 10 from Rwanda, one from the UK, who are ready to appear before Your Lordships to testify. Your Honours are also aware that the scheduling took into account the commitment of Your Lordships in other trials before this Tribunal. That is why this case was allotted this window of four weeks, because the Judges had to attend to another trial in September. If Counsel is granted the one-month adjournment he requests, we shall not be able to go to trial, because we shall not have a Chamber. Finally, Your Honours, the representative of the witness section has hinted at the grave risks we expose our witnesses to, should they have to return to Rwanda without testifying. And she has also underscored difficulties that may be encountered in procuring attendance of these witnesses on another occasion if they do not testify on this occasion. Should Your Lordships be inclined to grant this adjournment, the Prosecutor may well consider applying to have this case transferred to Rwanda for trial under the provisions of Rule 11bis <stage>(B)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. We would, therefore, invite Your Honours to dismiss Counsel's motion and order that the trial proceed as scheduled. Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to proceed. Well, with respect to the statements that were made by the Defence Management Section -- I'm sorry, I did not mention Laurent, because he knows that communication between him and our Defence team is excellent, perfect, there are no problems, but, Madam President, when I file an official document, there is a difference between an official friendship that I have with Laurent and the processing of the document, but that is not the point, Madam President. What I wanted to bring in before you today were the facts. I am not asking for an interpretation of a point of law or the facts; I am speaking of the facts. And when we speak of facts, I humbly believe that there are two solutions, either I am saying a falsehood or I am saying the truth. And I will give you an example.

            <p>I was saying, Madam President, that the matter ceased by the Trial Chamber today is not unknown, and I have sent a correspondence on the 26th. In this correspondence, I said that it was unfortunate that I was being able to respect the time deadlines and appear in court. And I state in paragraph F of the letter of the 26th of June that we will have to notify the Trial Chamber to statutes on the matter. Madam President, when we filed our motion, we had not contacted the women in Witness and Victims Support Section, that is true, Madam President, we did not contact them. It is true that there are logistical problems, we do not bring -- put this into consideration, but we just wish to present to you the facts and just the facts. And I'm sorry to have to note that even though he did not write me -- or, no, he did not say that the Prosecutor said that, I never raised the problems that appear in this motion. If I had not raised the problem, then why was I assigned an additional investigator, Madam President? Why?I did not just write to the Prosecutor with respect to this matter, I also wrote to the coordinator of the Trial Chamber on the 19th of May. And when I wrote a letter on the 19th of May, I had not yet attended the informal meeting. On the 12th of May, I also sent a letter to the chief of section and Mr. Prosecutor. When we appear before the Trial Chamber, I have said I am speaking about the facts. The Prosecutor began to investigate the matter in 1998; Gacumbitsi had not yet been arrested. And as we speak about the amount of time available to each of the parties, I do not wish to mention the equality of arms, nevertheless, I think that it is important to observe the different times allotted to both parties. And now it seems that the Prosecutor is ready to proceed, but this is not true. We cannot proceed, even though the documents should have been disclosed to me spontaneously, he said that I should -- I was invited on the 16th of May to come and review them. That is not possible, because the first meeting was not held until the 23rd of June. The infamous invitation of the 16th of May was issued on the 24th of July, 2003. The letter was given to me after I filed the motion to say that they had been invited previously. And this is why I mention it in the motion, and this was to come and review the map of Rusumo and the video tape available in the Office of the Prosecutor. I'm sorry, but with all due respect, Madam President, this map, these videos are documents that I need to review with my client. And I am saying that these two meetings, the two meetings were held between myself and the Office of the Prosecutor, the President of the Tribunal was there and other chiefs of section. And he said that he sent it on the 16th of May, but I did not become aware of it until the 24th of July -- of May, rather. And the Office of the Prosecutor has mentioned various matters that the Office of the Prosecutor was not able to review, because in view of the fact that I was not allowed to proceed on mission. I think that Laurent can confirm this. I financed the missions of my investigators for these short missions. And that is why in January, it appears that one of the investigators was assigned -- was not able to go on mission, but actually did go because I paid for them, when in February and in March when I came. I came not so much to work but, rather, with my own money so that I could be ready. And in February, I mention -- I can show you the letter, Madam President, if you would like to see it, I said that Mr. Gacumbitsi's trial did not impede the work of my investigators. And when I wrote those letters, it was in 2002. And now I am told that I had collected 2500 hours. That is not true, Madam President. In any case, I am asking once again the Trial Chamber to say that I have only stated the facts before you. I have receipts and supporting documents. I have said, and Laurent responded, why didn't they respond to my correspondence, Madam President? Is it lack of personnel? But faxes, telephones, tools could have been used. The additional means that I was requesting was assistants and investigators. The Prosecutor said that, but I did not receive them. Why is it that in the middle of a meeting I am told that you are assigned additional investigators? Why? Because we were all aware of the fact that there was a problem, that things had not been done properly with respect to my Defence team, I deplore this. We can still proceed, but nevertheless the facts are there, the facts are there. You have the power to review the facts that I have put before you. I have only brought facts. It is up to you to statute on the law. I am here in good faith before you, Madam President, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>We deliberated for little longer than we intended. The Chamber was seized on the 22nd of July 2003 of a motion by the Defence to put off the trial date by one month in the Gacumbitsi case, which is supposed to start today, on the 28th of July 2003. The Chamber has heard the arguments of both parties and comments made by the Defence section and the Victim Support Section. The Chamber having deliberated concludes as follows: First of all, the Defence states that it could not carry out all the field trips in Rwanda, which are necessary for the defence of the Accused person in this trial. He therefore says that there was a serious delay in its preparation. The Chamber notes that following the intervention or the statement from the responsible officer from the Defence section, the Defence recognised that some field trips had been conducted and a certain number of witnesses had already been contacted. The Defence did not contradict the Defence system <stage>(sic),</stage> which talked about contacts with over 200 witnesses by the Defence. The Chamber, therefore, concludes that the Defence carried out missions in preparation, and it will be possible to recall back Prosecution witnesses to interview or cross-examine them on specific issues if the Defence justify that before the Chamber. The delays in investigation by the Defence, does not justify the postponement of what the Prosecutor is saying. When the time comes, the issue will be raised taking into account the time when the Defence case has to start. Further, the Defence states that it did not have the two assistants requested assigned. The Chamber notes that an additional assistant was accepted by the President of the Tribunal during one of the meetings, and it considers that the Defence section validly explain the reasons why the second assistant has not been appointed up to this point, taking into account the possible conflict of interest of this assistant, which was raised by the Office of the Prosecutor since the assistant was a former worker with that office. The Chamber does not see in that enough reason to postpone the trial. The Chamber asked that the Defence section should do all in its power to ensure that the assistant is appointed as soon as possible. Lastly, the Defence states that it did not receive the necessary translations in the language that the Accused person and the counsel used, which is French. But after discussions it was clear that the Defence had received all the documents necessary for the preparation of the trial in the two working languages of the Tribunal, including the witness statements of Prosecution witnesses. That is, therefore, dismissed. The Chamber further recalls that the Defence has, on two occasions, accepted to begin this trial on the 28th of July 2003, and that at no point in time did it talk -- say that the problems that have been raised could impede its preparation. Further, the Chamber underscores that a number of witnesses are here in Arusha, and any adjournment may undermine their security and their further appearance in the Court. For these reasons, the Chamber dismisses the motion. Now that that decision had been rendered, I would like to listen to both parties on the need of a status conference now. As far as we, the Judges, are concerned, we think that we might perhaps start immediately with the Prosecutor's opening remarks. But if you think that there are matters that should be dealt with before hand, we might as well organise this status conference. Prosecution?</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. Your Honours, when this matter was scheduled for commencement of trial, it was my understanding that prior to the Prosecutor's opening address, there would be a status conference -- a pretrial conference in terms of Rule 73bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which appeared to make it mandatory that a pretrial conference be held. And I would read Rule 73bis <stage>(A).</stage> I quote: "The Trial Chamber shall hold a pretrial conference prior to the commencement of the trial". That notwithstanding, Your Honours, there are a couple of points -- housekeeping point that could appropriately be dealt with in the suggested pretrial conference. So I pray, Your Honours, that prior to my opening address, which I am ready to do this morning, we should first have a pretrial conference. Most obliged, Your Honours. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Most obliged, Madam President, Your Honours.Your Honours, on the evening of 6th of April 1994, the plane carrying President Juvénal Habyarimana crashed on its approach into Kanombe airport, killing all those on board.In the hours, days and weeks that followed, the Central African Republic of Rwanda was convulsed by a kind of blood-letting on a scale unseen in the last century. Massacres of civilians, mainly Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus, which started in Kigali within hours of the plane crash quickly spread throughout the country, and the next hundred days close to a million people lay dead.In his book, "The Destruction of European Jews," Raul Hilberg describes four stages in the process which led to their destruction. The first: Classification as a Jew; second: expropriation of property; the third: restrictions to Ghettos and camps, and the fourth: eventual extermination. A process, he says, that took nine years. Commenting on the speed and efficiency of the Rwandan genocide, Allan Dystaxia, former executive director ^Medicine Son Frontier, notes that by comparison the Hutu leaders in Rwanda went from stage one to stage four in a matter of few days.It's the case for the Prosecution,Your Honours, that the massacres that characterised the blood-letting in Rwanda were orchestrated by extremists within the military and the interim government that usurped power following the death of Juvénal Habyarimana. They depended, to a large extent, on the efficient, if not ruthless execution -- on the active participation of the territorial administrators, extremist militia, and the local Hutu population who had been mobilised and instigated by local government and extremist party leaders. In what has been aptly described and now widely accepted by legal scholars, sociologists and historians alike, as the Rwandan genocide, the ethnic Tutsi segment of the Rwandan society was targeted for annihilation on the pretext that the Tutsi were accomplices of the RPF, then at war with the Rwandan government, and that "they" were responsible for the death of President Habyarimana.Rusumo commune, which is remotely tucked away in the extreme southeastern corner of Rwanda where the Akagere River cascades over the Rusumo falls into Tanzania on its way to Lake Victoria, was not spared of this genocidal frenzy. In the days following the death ofPresident Habyarimana, Tutsi women, men and children were attacked in their homesteads, in Rusumo and in the neighbouring communes of Rukira, Birenga, Sache and Mugesera, and relentlessly pursued over the hills with the demonic relish to the most sacred of havens, the churches. Churches that had always sheltered thousands of Tutsis during a series of anti-Tutsi pogroms between 1959 and 1973, were transformed overnight into the very death-chambers in which countless Tutsi civilians met their macabre deaths.So shocking were the outrageous committed on human dignity broadcast across the globe by satellite T.V., and so shaken was the conscious of humanity, that the international community quickly responded by establishing this Tribunal to bring to justice those responsible for these gross violations of international humanitarian law. It is in this context,Your Honours, that we now appear before you to bring to trial the Accused Sylvestre Gacumbitsi for crimes alleged in the indictment.Permit me to note, Your Honours, that the genocide which left up to a million dead in a short span of a hundred days, also witnessed the mass displacement of up to four million people either internally or to neighbouring countries. Entire communities, therefore, had either been wiped out, displaced or both. In numbers, this represents over half of the pre-April l994 national populations of about eight million inhabitants. Police and judicial authorities had either been killed or were in flight, and the net result of this mayhem were conditions that did not lend themselves to the meticulous forensic inquiry often found in domestic jurisdictions during times of peace.The Prosecution is confident, however, that from the ushers of this conflict it has been able to assemble and shall present to you credible evidence in order to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Who is Sylvestre Gacumbitsi? To the inhabitants of Rusumo, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi needs little introduction. A teacher by profession, Gacumbitsi was appointed bourgmestre of Rusumo commune by presidential decree dated the 2nd of August 1983. By the time of the events alleged in the indictment, Gacumbitsi had been bourgmestre for 11 years.It is worth noting, Your Honours, that during the first nine years as bourgmestre, he also doubled as head of the local MRND party. As chief executive of the commune, a corporation sole, Gacumbitsi exercised de jure and defacto authority over the communal employees and wielded substantial power and influence over the local population in his community.Gacumbisti, Your Honours, wasn't an ordinary criminal, not at all. He was a family man, and is said to have lived in relative harmony with his neighbours and was even known to share drinks and exchange cows with some of his Tutsi subjects. His only distinguishing feature, Your Honours, was the rapid zealotry with which he pursued his Tutsi victims in the execution of the genocidal plan subsequent to the 6th of April 1994.Today, Your Honours, Gacumbisti stands charged with 5 counts: The count of genocide, or complicity in genocide in the alternative.He is also charged Your Honours with extermination, murder and rape, as crimes against humanity, all arising from culpable acts we allege he committed in concert with others as part of the common scheme whose singular objective was the total destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group.I will not engage, Your Honours, in any discussion of the various elements of the crimes charged, and would add they are sufficiently addressed in the Prosecutor's pretrial brief. Suffice to add, however, that in order to prove its case, the Prosecution will be relying on the evidence of several witnesses who fall into three broad categories.Your Honours will hear the evidence of victims and survivors; innocent men and women who lost entire families, who were gang-raped or witnessed their loved ones being raped at the hands and instigation of Sylsvestre Gacumbitsi and his cohorts. Men and women who lost everything it meant to be human. Men and women traumatised for life whose erstwhile crime was to be born Tutsi.You will also hear, Your Honours, the evidence of co-perpetrators, ordinary men who committed some of the crimes with which Gacumbitsi is charged., crimes which they have since been convicted of and sentenced in Rwanda. And, finally, Your Honours, you will hear the expert testimony of Alison Des Forges, whose duty it is to place the crimes charged in their proper context, the context of contemporary Rwandan history to show that the genocide and other crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda in 1994 were not a series of independent and spontaneous crimes committed by an angry Hutu population to avenge the death of President Habyarimana, but a meticulously planned and efficiently executed criminal campaign for the destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group. We allege, Your Honours, and shall prove by direct and circumstantial evidence, that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was no stranger to this diabolic plot and that in his commune he executed it with great efficiency in person and by proxy.The evidence to be adduced over the coming weeks will show that within the days of the plane crash, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi embarked on a criminal course that initially involved mobilization of local authorities and political party extremists within Rusumo commune; liaising with the military establishment in Kibungo préfecture; the collection and distribution of weapons for use in the extermination campaign; the instigation of others to rape and kill Tutsi civilians, and finally, Your Honours, his own active participation in the numerous killings that rocked Rusumo in April l994. Your Honours, the evidence will show a leader in full control of events, rather than a reluctant or unwilling participant subdued by forces beyond his control.You will hear, Your Honours, that on the 7th of April l994, shortly after receiving news of the death of President Habyarimana, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi visited the military camps at Rwanteru and Rusumo falls where he held extensive discussions with the military commanders and later met the notorious Lieutenant Colonel Rwagafirita.You will hear, Your Honours that on the 8th of April l994, Gacumbisti attended a meeting in Kibungo presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Rwagafirita, at which the local leader of the Interahamwe militia, one Cyasa was authorised to commence the extermination of Tutsis throughout Kibungo Préfecture .You will also hear, Your Honours, that on the 9th of April l994 Sylvester Gacumbisti as 'bourgmestre of Rusumo commune, presided over a meeting of conseilliers de secteur and responsables and political party leaders at the Rusumo Bureau communal where the plot to exterminate the Tutsi was elaborated.Evidence will be led, Your Honours, that on the 10th of April 1994, Gacumbitsi, with communal policemen, aboard three communal pick-up trucks, went to the army camp in Kubungo and took delivery of over a 100 cartons of assorted weapons, including grenades, and machetes from Lieutenant Colonel Rwagafirita. The said weapons were later distributed that same day throughout the secteurs in Rusumo commune.You will hear, Your Honours, that on the 11th of April 1994, Gacumbisti held a meeting with the local Interahamwe militia leader Cyasa at the Rusumo bureau communal for two hours after which Gacumbitsi proceeded to the Rusumo Falls military detachment to confer with the military officers.The evidence will further show,Your Honours, that on the 12th of April 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbisti visited the various secteurs in his commune, from Nyarubuye and Kankobwa in the northeast to Nyabitare and Gisenyi in the east and Kigarama in the south, during which he conferred with conseillers de secteurs. Later that day, Your Honours, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi attended a meeting with the military commander of the Rwanteru military camp. It is alleged, Your Honours, that on the same day Sylvestre Gacumbitsi went to Gisenyi and instructed local Hutu boat owners and soldiers not to ferry any fleeing Tutsi across the lake to Tanzania.The evidence will show, Your Honours, that Gacumbitsi attended the weekly market at Nyakarambi on Wednesday, 13th April, where he expected the Interahamwe militia of Kibungo to launch the massacres of Tutsis and asked the extremists party -- political party leaders to be on the alert.Evidence will be led, Your Honours, that Gacumbitsi was seen travelling around the commune on the 14th of April 1994 instigating and superintending the murder and rape of Tutsi civilians, and that he personally shot and killed two Tutsi civilians near Nyabitare Catholic Centre, only after his victims had paid him for the bullets with which they were killed.You will hear, Your Honours, that Gacumbitsi, in the company of communal policemen, Interahamwe militia armed with guns, grenades, cudgels, machetes, spears and swords, ordered and participated in the wholesale slaughter of Tutsi civilians who had sought refuge at Nyarubuye parish in an attack that lasted several hours; from 3:00 p.m. on Friday, 15th April 1994.You will also hear, Your Honours, how Gacumbisti returned to Nyarubuye Parish between the 16th and 17th of April 1994 to supervise the killing of any survivors, women and children inclusive so there that would be no one to live to tell the story.Your Honours will hear eye-witness accounts that in the days that followed the massacre at Nyarubuye parish, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi travelled around the commune aboard a vehicle and using a megaphone to instigate the rape and murder of any Tutsi survivors.Evidence will be led, Your Honours, of how he slit the belly of an ailing and pregnant woman and repeatedly stabbed her and the two foetuses to death, in addition to stabbing to death the victim's mother in-law.It doesn't injure the Prosecution case, Your Honours, to concede that Rwanda was at war with itself, but we submit that the massacres, rapes and murders alleged in the indictment were clearly not part of any war against the RPF. Neither were they a result of an archaic Hutu psychosis following the death of President Habyarimana.The killing, maiming and rape of noncombatant women and children is not war, Your Honours, nor does war provide any justification for the wholesale slaughter of innocent civilians. In common parlance, Your Honours, this wasn't collateral damage. The evidence will irresistibly point to a premeditated, calculated and efficiently coordinated effort by Gacumbitsi, in concert with others, to exterminate the Tutsi civilian population in Rusumo commune.Gacumbitsi is now before Your Honours today to answer for these crimes, and the Prosecution is ready to present its evidence.I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>I was based in Johannesburg, South Africa, as the southern Africa correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, in 1994, did you ever have occasion to travel to Rwanda?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>I had occasion to travel to Rwanda. Following the presidential election in South Africa, which I was reporting on for the BBC, I received a telephone call from my office in London, asking me to go to Rwanda to cover the events which were unfolding there. This would have been, by my calculations, in about the third week of May 1994.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, did you fly into Rwanda or did you drive, Mr. Keane?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>At the time it was -- at that time, it was not possible for me to fly into Rwanda. We drove into the country. We first flew to Nairobi and from there to Kampala and then we drove by road to the Uganda border, passing through Kabale and we crossed the Ugandan border into Rwanda, on or about the 28th of May.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>I was accompanied on this journey by Mr. David Harrison, BBC producer, by Mr. Hamilton Wendy, a BBC technician, by Mr. Glen Middleton, a BBC cameraman. We had two drivers whom we hired in Kampala, Uganda to make the journey.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>That is correct. It's a matter of security in war zones to, if possible, use two vehicles because if one vehicle should break down you then have a back-up.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>In common with all of the other journalists seeking to enter Rwanda from Uganda at that time, we had contacted the RPF in advance so that we might secure safe passage through the border area. When we arrived at the border, we contacted the officials at the post. We informed them that we were from the BBC, that we had been in touch with their office in Brussels. We waited for, I think it would have been approximately one hour, and were escorted to RPF offices at Mulindi, a short distance away.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. Keane. Can you just give us a brief description of what the atmosphere was like in Rwanda on arrival there, that is, between the border and the Mulindi post you've just mentioned?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>My recollection of that time is of being astonished at the difference between Uganda and Rwanda. It was not so much a case of passing from one country to another, but from passing from one universe to another, because Uganda was, to my eyes at that time, a typical central Africa country. It was bustling, there was much traffic on the roads, there were people working in the fields. Entering Rwanda, first an overpowering image was of emptiness, the country emptied of people. The only people we saw, in fact, were the soldiers of the RPF and I think I got a vague glimpse of some women standing on the hillside, but that was it. The overpowering impression was of emptiness, a country that had -- if I can -- if I may use the comparison, it was as if someone had placed a giant hoover over the country and sucked all of the life out of it.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Witness. Now, you have put this at on or about the 28th of May 1994; am I correct?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>That is correct.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, by the time you arrived in Rwanda on or about that date, did you have a clear itinerary of what you'd cover during your assignment to Rwanda?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>Normally, when making current affairs documentaries one likes to, for simple logistical reasons, have a very clear idea of what your itinerary is going to be. And you're factoring in many things: how long you need to hire drivers and interpreters. So we do generally try and stick to an itinerary; however, this was somewhat different because of the chaotic conditions which held in the country. Because of our general uncertainty about what, if anything, we were going to find. Those journalists coming out of Rwanda warned us that the conditions were the most difficult and dangerous that they had ever encountered. And so this was playing on my mind when we entered the country. We had encounters with all of the other journalists by this stage in late May, and made aware of the reports of widespread massacres. It was mine and that of my colleagues' desire to visit the scenes of some massacres. But I also made it clear to my colleague that I wanted to travel to the part of the country which was still in the hands of the government forces to be able to speak to people on that side about what was happening. Our first goal was to come safely across the border, stay somewhere safely for the night, which we did at Byumba. We sought an RPF escort to take us down through the country because of the danger of potential ambush. And I should add that on one occasion we almost became victims of an ambush in spite of having an escort. So security was a primary consideration in asking for an escort. We met, close to Byumba, a group of Australian journalists who were leaving the country and it was they who told us about a massacre at a place called Nyarubuye, which they described to being close to the border of Tanzania. We asked our guide and escort if they will take us to the site and they agreed.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Witness. Did your RPF guide in any way dictate where you were supposed to go and what you were supposed to see?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>No, they did not. I have worked, as you might have imagined, over 20 years in journalism in many, many situations where armies and guerilla forces have attempted to lay down strict guidelines about what I do. This was not like that. My overriding impression at the time was that the RPF was preoccupied with fighting the war and may have regarded, certainly from the initial conversations that we had with them at Byumba, having to assign two of their soldiers to protect us as somewhat of an encumbrance. And the issue at hand with which we are dealing today, that is the question of Nyarubuye, I want to emphasise again that it was at the suggestion of two Australian journalists we decided to make that journey. I should also say that the massacre at Nyarubuye had been mentioned by other journalists in Nairobi on our journey through.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>To the best of my recollection, Your Honours, we travelled from Byumba to the commune offices at Rusumo and decided to make our base there for the next 24 to 48 hours. By the time we reached those offices, it was afternoon. There were security concerns and we decided to camp down there rather than in one of the nearby towns.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, we travelled from Rusumo compound -- Rusumo commune that afternoon in the direction of Nyarubuye, the parish church of Nyarubuye. This involved travelling on a tarmac road for perhaps 15 to 20 minutes, as I recall, and then turning left off that road into the bush. We then followed a very overgrown and rough bush track. From what I estimate, it was about 35 to 40 minutes. The overpowering impression, again, on this track, was of emptiness, that and the fact that the bush seemed so overgrown. There were no people in the banana plantations, no people working in the fields. We passed empty cabins, houses where people had fled from. There was no sign of life whatsoever. We travelled further along this path and then we became aware of a building in the distance. I could see a red shape in the distance coming through the trees. There were large trees to the left-hand side of the road, almost forming, if you like, an arch one passed along and it was along this final route that we came to the parish church at Nyarubuye.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, my estimate is that it would have been late afternoon when we arrived there because the sun was already setting; it was dusk. And I do remember that we were all concerned for reasons of security that we would be able to visit the parish church compound and try to return safely before darkness.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>My first impression was not of sight, but of smell, that when one opened the door of the car, the smell of decomposing corpses was very strong in the air. So it was not a sight that was the first impression, but a smell.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>I got out of the car and walked across the forecourt of the church complex. To my right I think I remember being aware of the body of a man on the -- although it was hard to say whether it was a man or a woman, it was so advanced in decomposition. It was a human -- there were human remains on the steps of the church. As we walked across there were more remains, perhaps three or four people and I passed around these and crossed through some open gates and followed along a pathway. And as we entered through these gates, the smell of decomposition, of decomposing flesh became worse. I have -- I had, prior to that period, seen dead bodies. I was based in South Africa after all, and had covered conflicts in Angola, Eritrea, Ireland. I had seen dead bodies and I had smelt decomposition, but the smell was unlike anything that I have ever experienced before or since.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, I estimate that it was an hour and a half to two hours, but I stress "estimate" because one of the things that happened when I was confronted with the scene was, if you like, a sense of timelessness. I know that isn't a very exact definition, but that is what it felt like.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>I can only describe it in terms of what it would take to walk. And to walk from one end of the church compound to the other, under normal circumstances, would take a -- estimate, about 10 minutes. On that occasion, however, our progress was much slower because of the sights that we were encountering as we walked across the compound and these were bodies on either side of the pathway, most in an advanced stage of decomposition. Bodies further into the centre of the compound near where what I understood to be the church offices were, these bodies were piled high outside one of the doors. The impression I had of those bodies, where the people had been crowded together at the moment of death, was that they were melting into one another.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-keane">
            <speaker>WITNESS KEANE:</speaker>
            <p>We entered into the church itself and by this time it had become dark and we had a single light on the camera which was able to pick out small areas of the church. And through the light of the camera, we saw bodies lying in different parts of the church. There were not as many bodies in the church complex itself. Some of those bodies that we saw were schoolchildren because they were still wearing schoolchildren's uniform. We came out of the church and we also filmed a large room in which bodies lay and we filmed several classrooms in which there were bodies. In one classroom there was the body of what I took to be a mother and her children.</p>

This was because I was very determined, and in view of the gravity of the charges that they were making against him, that we had recorded the correct person.

            <p>The image which you are now seeing is of the lead vehicle in our convoy travelling along the track towards Nyarubuye. It is being filmed from the second vehicle. There were two; one was an Isuzu, the other was a Mercedes. They were driven by Ugandan drivers. These were robust vehicles because of the nature of the track. It was very rough and had become considerably overgrown. The principal impression one had driving along here in these vehicles was the absence of human life; that, and the concern one felt that with such close vegetation, ambush was a possibility, because we knew we were close to the Tanzanian border across which many of the Interahamwe had fled.This is an image taken of the second vehicle as it climbs an incline leading towards the parish church of Nyarubuye. </p>

            <p>This is the last portion of the drive towards the parish church compound at Nyarubuye. Again, the impression of one driving to it at that time was of the absence of life. Here I came out of the car escorted by the guide towards the church complex. We crossed the front of the church. Other elements of human remains, and then several bodies scattered.As a veteran of reporting a number of wars, the thing which struck me also quite strongly was the absence of khaki or green camouflage uniforms among the dead. They were all, to me, unmistakenly civilian.</p>

            <p>These were more of the church offices. Behind these bodies -- it is difficult to see it on the screen, but there were more bodies piled up next to the wall. There was -- it was very difficult to count. To be honest with you, I didn't try to count.It was clear to us as well that the effect of the rains and the humid environment seemed to have speeded up the process of decomposition, though I am not -- I should add I am not a forensic pathologist. It was just an impression one gained.At this point we are moving back down the path that we had previously advanced along and towards the direction of the church itself.People seemed to have died in small groups, slightly larger groups, and then a very large group that we saw near the church offices. But I want to stress again that we did not see everything.This was one of the bodies near the main church complex itself. And this was a side door to the church, and it was in fact this door that I entered the church through. This was the very front of the church. There had recently been the Easter celebrations at the church and there was a banner hanging underneath.And the offices just to the left there were another set of offices that we did not go into, but we did hear noises coming from those offices later, which one of our drivers believed to be either dogs or rats. But by that stage it was dark and we did not want to investigate.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, I referred some moments ago to a room in one of the church compounds that our cameraman did stand at the door of and take some images, and this is that particular room. It is, I guess, about 100 yards from the main church complex -- from the church itself.These again are images of dead civilians.This was a body which lay outside the room on the steps. It seemed to -- to me, standing next to it, to have been the body of a child.This is the doorway to the room in question.Your Honours, I mentioned some moments ago a classroom or a series of classrooms. These were images recorded in that classroom. </p>

This is the uniform commonly worn by schoolchildren in Rwanda.In parts of the church itself there were bones lying scattered around, as well as corpses. This may have been as the result of animals, but I -- I cannot be certain of that.This was close, as I -- quite close to the altar.</p>

It is about a two-minute clip, and after that clip it is when I intend to move this Chamber to receive this collection into evidence. So it is entirely at your discretion, Your Honours. If you are inclined to receive the videos into evidence now, I'm happy to do it, and then we can go into closed session. Alternatively, if the witness can be allowed to identify the short clip, then we can go back into open session for me to move the Chamber to receive the exhibits.</p>

            <p>Madam President, as concerns the footage we have just looked at, we took advantage of our break to look at it or watch it for a while, but the five, seven or eight -- I believe all those who watched them with me, I do not think that we did watch those other cassettes.But as concerns the pictures or images that the witness has just commented on, we did see them, but for the others that are not included that we have not seen this afternoon, we did not see them either. </p>

            <p>If I may clarify on this anomaly, Your Honours, it is like if the Prosecutor was tendering into evidence a document or report of 100 pages but only sought to rely on two paragraphs. What we have done is to tender into the evidence the entire footage comprising approximately more than three hours, but we have only relied on portions which the witness has identified, portions that are relevant to this trial. There are portions that are not relevant about his journey to Kigali, his journey to Butare, but we are producing the entire video, and the video log will show the marker numbers for the excerpts for files Nos. 1 through 7.

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Absolutely, Madam President. I said that the parts on which the -- which the witness commented on, I beg your pardon, we watched them during the break. The other parts that were announced, we did not see. I am saying that under oath, and the Office of the Prosecutor can bear us out. We ended up with the visit to the Benaco camp, and when we got there, it stopped. That is what happened.Now, what is being announced now includes portions that we did not see. I believe that these anomalies could be avoided if they had been shown up to 13, 14, 15. I think we have enough time. Why do they try to surprise us at every turn? We stayed here, my client, his security officers, we watched it all, and then we stopped at 8, and now we are talking about 15. I believe that is not normal, Madam President, and I must state it.I think and I believe, and I hope it appears on record, that parts of what has to be seen have to be chosen, and I believe that there is something there which is not proper.

            <p>Thank you, Mr. Kouengoua. Mr. Prosecutor, you have the floor to tell us which witness you will be bringing this morning and if there are any other additional matters which you wish to raise.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Most obliged, Your Honour. Maybe before we call the next witness to the stand, there are a couple of internal housekeeping matters that we wish ironed out before we proceed. It has always been our desire to ensure that the Chamber is fully briefed on how we intend to proceed at the beginning of every week, and today I just wish to start with three matters which merit special attention. Maybe I should start, Your Honours, by confirming that the Prosecutor filed her list of witnesses for this week on Friday as promised, and in order to ensure that there was no lapse or delay in serving the Defence with this list, I personally went to Mr. Kouengoua's office and gave him a copy, and we enjoyed a brief and frank discussion on how to proceed with this trial with as little disruption as possible. Now, that being the case, Your Honours, after a weekend review of our case, the Prosecutor is happy to move this Chamber for leave to vary its list yet again in order to drop two witnesses from the list of this week.We have deemed it unnecessary to call these witnesses to testify, and in the best of adversarial tradition we offer the said witnesses to the Defence if they so wish, subject however to the caveat that any approach to these witnesses by the Defence has to be done with prior notification to the Prosecution, and any interview has to be done in the presence of the Prosecution, because these are witnesses covered by a Witness Protection Order of this Chamber. The witnesses we seek to drop from the list of this week are TAT and TAU. Now, we had listed seven witnesses; that means we will be leading the evidence of five witnesses this week.Finally, Your Honours, if leave is granted to dispense with the appearance of these witnesses, it is our intention to complete the five remaining witnesses of this week by close of business on Wednesday, 6th of August 2003, after which we shall be seeking for an adjournment until Monday the 18th of August 2003. The grounds for this application, Your Honours, are that counsel for the Prosecution are engaged between the 11th and the 15th of August in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Ntagerura, Bagambiki and Imanishimwe before Trial Chamber III for closing arguments.Maybe I should draw your attention, Your Honours, to the scheduling instructions of Judge Møse dated the 25th of June 2003, which adverted to the possibility of this brief break in the proceedings.The counsel for the Prosecution will need Thursday and Friday of this week to work on the final touches of the closing arguments in the Cyangugu case, which has been in trial for the last three years, a complex Prosecution involving three accused, two indictments, and over 120 witnesses. Now, if it pleases Your Lordships, I would add that I have discussed this matter with counsel for the Defence and emphasised that the break in proceedings would give counsel an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the transcripts of Alison des Forges in the Akayesu trial, which Your Honours, by decision of the Presiding Judge dated 1st of August 2003, admitted onto the record pursuant to Rule 92bis <stage>(D).</stage> We just wish to underscore that this brief adjournment will not compromise our target of closing the Prosecution of the current case within the time allotted to it -- i.e., we do expect to have closed the Prosecution case before the 28th of August. Now, on the proposed resumption of trial between the 18th of August and the 22nd of August, we propose to lead the remaining witnesses within that week, and maybe I should add that, as we have done, we may also be inclined to further drop some witnesses during the process. Now, subsequent to your decision admitting the transcript of Alison des Forges onto the record, we have contacted the expert, and the earliest she can appear before Your Lordships will be on Monday the 25th of August 2003. She is currently engaged in Boston, and that is the only -- or the earliest opportunity she has to appear before Your Honours. Since we are offering her only for cross-examination by the Defence, we don't expect her testimony -- or the cross-examination to take the whole of that week. So, with those few comments, Your Honours, I would like to thank you very much.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Prosecutor.Counsel Kouengoua, do you have any comments that you wish to make about what the Prosecutor has just stated? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. The Defence team has no specific comments to make. It is correct that the Prosecutor disclosed the list of witnesses that he will call starting on the 4th, as stated previously, but during our conversation -- during our warm and fruitful conversation, I did not imagine that there would be absent witnesses, and that was the first surprise that was mentioned this morning.The second surprise that unfortunately changes the whole structure of justice at the ICTR in the second week is due to the fact that the Defence -- and I mentioned this in a proximate manner earlier -- that we have to follow the pace set by the Prosecutor. If the Prosecutor chooses not to present 10 out of 11 witnesses, that is his decision, but to say that in two or three days we would have to examine and cross-examine 10 witnesses, the problem is a different one in nature. And I think that this is what has been happening since the 20th of July.If the Prosecutor chooses to withdraw witnesses, that is his decision, but I don't think he should be the one to set the pace. He can make an application, but from the very beginning the Prosecution seems to do certain things that raise certain problems for us. Let me give you a few examples in order not to lose any judicial time. You know that later, in order to convince everyone, he said, "The plane is leaving tomorrow", and it is true the plane left, especially as the decision had been rendered. But then he said, "This person was supposed to leave tonight", and he did leave on the plane at 8 p.m.I respectfully request the Trial Chamber to bring to the attention of the Prosecutor that he should take appropriate measures to allow us, if it would not be possible for those witnesses not to charter a plane maybe, but have more time.He has just told us, "I plan to withdraw witnesses TAT and TAU". Out of the seven witnesses, that means that five witnesses remain, and they will be called by Wednesday. In that case, I mean, I don't know how it is going to happen. I mean, it raises many difficulties.I agree that the Prosecutor has to appear in another trial. However, this does not justify what he has just presented, and this is why very respectfully we submit that the pace that the Prosecutor is seeking to impose, the Trial Chamber should not follow this schedule and should not impose it on the Trial Chamber. I think that if he presents such a schedule with such a pace, the Trial Chamber should temper it and make it credible.I have always said, and I will never repeat it enough, that the first Prosecution witness was heard in 1998 -- at least this was for the first witness statement. This is information that he has been aware of since 1998. We received this information in June/July 2003, and it causes a great deal of problem. This is information that he has been aware of for five years. He cannot impose on us that we follow this pace. Therefore if the Trial Chamber wishes to grant the Prosecutor's application, then his program, his schedule, should not be accepted.Five Prosecution witnesses in three days, from Monday 9 o'clock -- because it is currently 9 o'clock -- until Wednesday 5 p.m., I believe that this is unacceptable, Madam President. This is what I wanted to say. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Before he became a bourgmestre he was a teacher, and there was a child I used to visit who was his pupil. Subsequently he became bourgmestre, but he was also the chairman of a bank that I was a member of.After he was sworn in as a bourgmestre in 1982 or 1983, I'm not sure of the year, he was presented to the people of the commune. I had the opportunity to see him on that occasion. Subsequently he chaired meetings at the secteur level, and at the time he would call a meeting at the commune level.I also saw him on several other occasions on the market place when he would come to collect taxes and fees.

Then when I got to the Catholic centre, about 30 metres from there I saw a vehicle, a pick-up, with some people on board. It was a double-cabin pick-up. I don't know whether it was a Hilux. In any case, it was a pick-up. There were policemen in the rear; in the cabin itself there was Gacumbitsi and some other people. </p>

            <p>Yes, I saw him in the vehicle with the policemen. There were several policemen. Two came out of the vehicle; I had already mentioned their names, Kazoba and Berakumenyo. I saw them come out, they stood a bit, and then after pulling out the young men they were hitting them with the butt of their guns. When they were outside I saw Gacumbitsi question those young men. I didn't hear what he said, but they took something from their pockets. I don't know whether it was money or identity cards. There was a lot of noise, and I thought maybe they had given them money. They were screaming, asking for mercy. They were saying, "Forgive us. Please don't touch us. Kill us, shoot us, instead of killing us with a machete". So they were killed in an atrocious manner.But before they were killed, if my memory doesn't fail me, he left in a vehicle. He left a policeman on the stop. I don't recall the name of the policeman, because subsequently after he had left I went to seek refuge in some other place far from there.</p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, the most precise answer I can give you is that if you allow me 15 minutes I will begin the cross-examination on the 16th minute. When it will end, I cannot tell you in the present state of affairs, for the simple reason that as in the three last cases, it depends on the witness's answers.As you know, this is criminal procedure; I must speak to my colleagues from time to time. So to give you a precise time would be presumptuous on my part. I would rather not, in the present state of affairs.</p>

            <p>Very well. All right. Perhaps you might give us an approximate idea a bit later. We will therefore break for 15 minutes to allow you to prepare yourself, but then we probably won't take our break at 11:00, so please try to be precise, concise, so the cross-examination does not take too long.We note the Prosecution only took an hour -- less than an hour, in fact, 54 minutes precisely, for examination-in-chief. </p>

            <p>On that day I heard of the killings, and I also heard that they had been used to kill the inhabitants of the secteur.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, they were distributed. But when he reached the place where I was hiding, first he had gone around a bit, and I believe that he had already distributed the weapons somewhere else, because the secteur is quite vast, and I believe the weapons had already been distributed. According to information I received that evening, I was informed that the weapons that were used by the local people, by the Interahamwe, were weapons that had been given to them. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-tac">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. When they reached the Catholic centre -- or compound, rather, he spoke to them, but I could not follow their conversation. But immediately after they entered the building, after speaking to them -- after speaking to him, and immediately after that they entered the buildings of the Catholic compound.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-tac">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that's correct. He said those words when he spoke to the policemen and to the persons who were in charge of the secteur before they began the massacres. </p>

            <p>Your Honours, there's also a mischaracterisation of the witness's evidence. In evidence-in-chief the witness did not suggest that the child was Gacumbitsi's child; he was visiting a child or a friend who was at the school where Gacumbitsi taught, and the Prosecutor submits, Your Honours, that the particulars of this child are unnecessary and irrelevant to this Trial.</p>

            <p>Not particularly, Madam President. I wish to point out that, to explain how he knew Gacumbitsi; he said he was a teacher and that he had a child whom he had visited -- a child. So I wanted to find out whether that was Gacumbitsi's child, that's all. </p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, would it have been necessary to check on those points, because this was a matter of evidence during the examination-in-chief which, if my memory serves, it was the fourth question in open session. If my memory doesn't fail me, he said: "He was a teacher; he had a child whom I visited, he was the president of a bank. I saw him come to the market on a tax drive. He was the president of a party." So, I cannot understand why 20 minutes later on --</p>

I'd able to recognise his face, his features, but as for knowing whether he was wearing a suit with a tie, that's very difficult. I saw his face and I hid myself.

When I raised my head I saw these people entering the centre, and when they left there -- or when they came out of there, I saw them beating those young men with the butts of their guns. And when they were outside I hid my head, but I had already seen that this was Gacumbitsi, without being able to recognise or identify what he was wearing.

            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. You see, normally, the road goes to Nyarubuye parish, but it also goes another place. Nyarubuye parish is on the border with Rukira secteur and if the bourgmestre took that road, whereas it leads to the border of his commune, Nyarubuye commune, there was no reason for me to suppose that he was going to Rukira; I thought he was going to Nyarubuye, inasmuch as the leaders were in the habit of going to Nyarubuye because there were development projects -- there was a big church tbere. And when we saw a leader heading in that direction, we were sure that he was going to Nyarubuye, and it was in Nyarubuye commune, unless he was going to Rukira. But I personally told myself that since it was in his commune and on the border of his commune, he would not go beyond the border of his commune and, therefore, he was going to that place. I should like to say this: When the local people saw a leader take that road in that direction, we always thought that that leader was going to Nyarubuye. I, therefore -- either for a meeting, to see the priests, in fact, Nyarubuye was a very important place in Mikongo; it was the most important place in Mikongo.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>
            <p>The point is, how then -- how then were you able to look inside of the tray of the Toyota vehicle from that position? I think that's the point that learned Counsel is trying to labour. Could you explain how you were able to see?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-tac">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I will explain. In fact, when the two boys were taken down, they weren't shot immediately. The vehicle turned and then drove off, and that's when I sort of got up to see where the vehicle was going. I got up and I looked, and I saw in the back of the vehicle -- that's when I saw what the vehicle was carrying. And it was immediately afterwards that the two boys were shot and I completely hid myself and did not get up again. But when the vehicle turned to drive off, they hadn't yet shot the two boys. And when it turned to leave, that's when I raised my head to see which -- where the vehicle was going -- in what direction it was going, and that's when I saw the guns that were stacked in the back. I don't know whether they were the policemen's guns, because the policemen, in any case, had their own guns, and they were between their feet. What -- and what drove me to immediately hide myself is the shooting, when -- as soon as I heard the shooting, and that was just as the vehicle was driving off, and that's when I hid again. What drove me to look was I wanted to know where the vebicle was heading. I think I already told you that I was on my way to Nyarubuye, that's where I was going to seek refuge, and I wanted to know where the vehicle was heading, and that's when I took the decision to stay hidden at that place until nightfall.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-tac">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>No; in fact, according to what I saw then, it was as though they were in a hurry -- they were in a race against time because it was getting late. When he left, I say -- I'd rather say that he left the policemen on the spot, and drove off, but according to what I saw they were in a hurry because time was getting short. It was about noon -- 1 p.m. as though -- the impression was that perhaps they had started the massacres a bit late; they didn't want to waste time there because there were only two people to be killed, and the secteur was where there was the most Tutsi. I think it's probably where there were the most Tutsi -- the foremost place for Tutsi who were cattle raisers. And this is why there were so many victims, because even the population from other secteurs around had come to participate in the massacres, because there were many cows. One herder could easily have between 20 and 50 cows, and the population responded to these massacres because they wanted to come and share out the cows, and there were many victims, especially because of the wealth of the victims. And I think that if he didn't spend much time there, it was because there were only two victims and time was getting on; it was getting late. The news had already travelled around that many people had sought refuge in Nyarubuye. That's even why I wanted to go to Nyarubuye, because I had heard that news.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, but these are things that were told me because I, myself, ran away that night. But, for example, the Stout vehicle referred to before was -- belonged to a certain Hakizamungu, had on board several people from Nyakarambi, Rusumo commune. There was another Daihatsu pick-up which was full of people. I didn't even know the owner of the Daihatsu. There were Revela <stage>(phonetic)</stage> secteur, which also borders on Nyabitare, where there were Bakhiga people who come from Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfecture, who had been given plots of land along the Kagera and who killed a lot of people. They drowned all the people who wanted to cross the river. They even drowned my brother-in-law with his seven children when they were trying to cross the Kagera. He, himself, he knows; he came to collect the taxes in the secteur, and it took up to two days to collect taxes because of the number of head of cattle there were in the secteur. It was a very prosperous secteur inhabited by cattle-raising Tutsi. And because of the wealth, the whole commune -- all the leaders came to that secteur. And I think that today there is not even a tenth of the population that there was then still alive. But as I am telling you, these were things that were reported to me afterwards. It seems that he had come back to that place, but I had already left, and it seems that he even came with another person called Gatete from Byumba, from Nyakarambi commune, and they set up a camp in Gacumbitsi's commune with the refugees from Murambi commune. And those refugees who had no food assistance because the World Food Program was not working in that secteur, it would appear that those refugees took the vehicles of the people who had been killed and came to kill people in Nyarubuye secteur, and at the same time steal foodstuff, pilfer foodstuff and the cows, which they could eat, as their loot from -- they are looting. And that is why nearly the whole commune -- and the refugees who had come with Gatete attacked the secteur and that's why there were such large-scale killings. I don't think there is -- there must be barely 20 survivors in the whole secteur. And people sometimes were surprised at how many Tutsi were there, even the leaders would be surprised because there were many Tutsi in that secteur. But I repeat, these are things that were told me. When we left there were people that came after me, two days or more, and then told me what happened after I left. But even it was difficult for me to flee because Gacumbitsi had -- shooting all the boats crossing the Kagera, and people that were helping people to cross the Kagera were also shot, so these things were told me. Perhaps other witnesses can tell you about it at greater length. There was someone who helped us to cross --</p>

            <p>I would like to provide explanations, with your permission. When they asked me if Gacumbitsi was carrying a weapon, I said yes because when you are a leader -- Gacumbitsi, it was almost as if he were the commanding officer of these policemen. If I said that Gacumbitsi carried a weapon, I remember saying he wasn't carrying a weapon in his hand. But as a commander, a commander of the police officers, they executed his orders. And later I have already stated that there were weapons in his vehicle. And I have stated how I had -- people had told me that he had distributed weapons. Unless the Defence counsel's question is to know whether Gacumbitsi shot them himself, but I have already said that the policeman was the one who shot them. And in my understanding, if he was the commander of the policemen who were carrying weapons, then he also had weapons. When I say that he has weapons, I don't mean to say that he was carrying a weapon in his hand. And this is why I told the investigators that Gacumbitsi had weapons. In a few words, those are the explanations I can provide. I would like to add that as to my wife and sisters, I had been able to send a message to my wife, my sisters and children. I had asked a Hutu friend of mine to tell them, and it was normal for him to know where I was hiding. And he even tried to bring me food. And my wife, who was well advanced in her pregnancy could do nothing, and hid at the house of a Hutu friend. And I asked this person, when this person brought me food, to instruct my wife to stay where she was. She knew that she couldn't do anything, but if she had the strength then she could join me so that we could go to Nyarubuye together. I told them what itinerary I was going to follow so that they could join me. And you see, when you hide you cannot take a straight road. And if I left my house at 12, I could have reached Nyarubuye -- where I was hiding at 12, I could have reach Nyarubuye at 6 p.m. And I think that is where this information comes from, that we were going to Nyarubuye, but in reality, at the time I was alone. But after that, my three sisters came to follow me, but they felt the situation was very tense and they went back to the place where they were hiding previously. And this is how we were able to meet -- to gather in the evening. In reality, we weren't together, but I had arranged for a message to be sent to them that they should follow me to Nyarubuye because that is where everyone was seeking refuge. That is how the situation unfolded. The person who wrote down my statements might have made a few mistakes or not so perfectly followed what I said in my statement. But what I am telling you today is the manner in which the events took place.</p>

            <p>Thank you, TAC. Can you tell us if you heard if anything happened at Nyarubuye parish, and at what date?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-tac">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>People say, but I only heard this upon my return, nevertheless, on the day the incident took place at the catholic centre, starting at 2:30 p.m. up until 5 p.m., there was a great deal of noise, of shooting coming from the direction of the parish. And most of the people who were going to Nyarubuye stopped on the way and were killed in the secteur. In view of the shooting that could be heard between 3 and 5 p.m., all of the people who were fleeing stopped. And that is why I stopped at the centre because many people who were on the way to Nyarubuye who had left before me came back and were killed in Nyabitare secteur. As to Nyarubuye, my paternal aunt's family was decimated there. It was a family of over 30 persons and not one of them survived. That is what I know. Many persons were killed in Nyarubuye.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness TAC, now you are saying that Gacumbitsi prevented you from going to Nyarubuye or was it because you heard the shooting that you didn't go to Nyarubuye?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-tac">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAC:</speaker>
            <p>Before I hid I had not yet heard the shooting, I hid from Gacumbitsi. And I mentioned the place where I was hiding before. I left that place, as I said because they had started to burn the houses down in my locality and destroy them. I saw people running and screaming on the hills and I decided to go to Nyarubuye. But in reality, even if I was hiding, there was a reason for that. I was hiding that morning because on the Thursday we had been told that Gacumbitsi's secteur, the one which he resided which was called Kigina, which is close to the Rusumo commune office, many persons had been killed in that secteur, and these are secteurs that are nearby. Kigina is neighbouring -- neighbours of Nyabitare. And people were saying on that Thursday that in Kigina secteur and in other bordering secteurs, massacres had took place, and that the day that followed -- the next day near Nyabitare would also be a target, that is why I went to hide. And some went to Nyarubuye, others did not reach Nyarubuye and stopped on the way. When I saw Gacumbitsi's vehicle, and in view of the information that I had received that Gacumbitsi had played a role in the massacres in the other secteurs, when I saw the vehicle I hid. But, in fact, when I hid I had not yet heard the shooting coming from Nyarubuye. When the vehicle left, quite a long period of time elapsed, I would say over an hour before we started to hear the shooting coming from Nyarubuye. That is when we heard the explosions and we heard the steady gunfire from different types of firearms, explosions of grenades and I don't know, all kind of weapons. One could almost have thought that it was loud music. Nyarubuye is far away on the horizon, far from where I was. And from where I was, you could hear the sounds. I would say that there was a valley between Nyarubuye and Nyabitare. When you go from Nyabitare and follow the road used by most people, you cross a river, then you go up toward the place called Nyarubuye, and it is beyond Nyabitare. So when something happens in Nyarubuye, because of the valley, you can hear echoes in Nyabitare because of the valley and the river. So you could have thought that the sounds were coming close by and not far from where I was. And this is why all of those who were thinking to seek refuge in Nyarubuye, came back. They came back and were killed in the place where they were living. Subsequently, all of the persons that were in Nyarubuye were not killed. We were able to meet survivors that told us that Gacumbitsi had arrived and had triggered the massacres. I wasn't there; it was the people talking about it.</p>

            <p>Yes. So, we met and told each other how things were, what the situation was, what was going on here and there, the people that were chasing us. He told me that he had taken the decision to seek refuge in Kigina secteur, at Gacumbitsi's since they were friends. So that he could protect him or give him someone or some people to accompany him to seek refuge in Tanzania; that is what he told me. And then I asked him if he knew where the roadblocks were since he had been moving around in the daytime. He told me he didn't know where the roadblocks were. After that exchange, I told him I hadn't been able to find a way to flee and I asked him to allow me to go with him. And I, moreover, asked him to wait so that we could leave after nightfall in order to try and avoid the killers. And at about 6:30 p.m., 7 p.m. we started out with his two sons and we talked at length as -- on the way. And I decided to be with him, but not to the same destination as he, to stay close to where he was going.</p>

            <p>No, I was not able to see his body. Nevertheless, in 1997, when they were reburying the persons who had been killed at that place - - and many persons were killed at a roadblock close by - - at the time we recognised his remains and we recognised them by the clothing that their remains were wrapped in because I had seen his clothing on the day he was killed and I recognised the clothing.</p>

            <p>After Gacumbitsi's vehicle went by, another vehicle followed, blue this time, like a stout. It was a Toyota stout vehicle. And some time after that, another vehicle, Daihatsu, in which there were many people dancing in the vehicle.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS TAK:</speaker>
            <p>There were a lot of people singing Interahamwe songs. The type of song that they would sing when they were hunting men -- victims, and this proved that they were Interahamwe. They were wearing uniform made of straw or banana leaves.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-tak">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAK:</speaker>
            <p>They were in the vehicle that was following Gacumbitsi. It was a Toyota stout, and there was also the vehicle that came by last. That was a Daihatsu type vehicle, and that is where most of the people were that were singing Interahamwe songs, but they were singing, "Let's exterminate them. Let's exterminate the Inyenzi", and other songs of this type.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-tak">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAK:</speaker>
            <p>In truth, I did not pay attention to the type of clothing that they were wearing, but there were persons not many, but there were persons in the rear tray of the vehicle.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, let me rephrase the question. You've told Their Lordships that there were two people on the two pick-ups that came after Gacumbitsi's pick-up, the stout and the Daihatsu pick-up had people who were dancing or singing Interahamwe songs. You've also told us they wore straw or straw and banana leaves, and you have identified them as Interahamwe. All I am asking is whether the people you saw on the first pick-up; that is, Gacumbitsi's pick-up, were similarly dressed or were they dressed in a different -- in different attire?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-tak">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAK:</speaker>
            <p>Those who were in the last two vehicles were the ones who were wearing these art costumes, straw and banana leaves, but in Gacumbitsi's vehicle, there might have been between three and five persons in the rear tray of the pick-up and they were not wearing a particular uniform that struck me as odd. There was nothing that struck me as being odd in what they were wearing.</p>

I fled immediately. I did not pay close attention to his vehicle.

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam, I should like to assert something here, if I may. I don't think that the witness himself was in prison, unless I misunderstood. He is describing the circumstances in which he met someone's acquaintance. If the person exists or has existed, 50 or 10,000 people must have visited him in prison, and I don't think this that can identify someone. It is the bourgmestre's younger brother and not a member of the witness's family.</p>

            <p>Is it really necessary, Counsel? Do you need a clarification on this point? Prosecution has explained that the witness made a clarification, but that did not get through to the Defence because he objected before the witness's testimony was translated.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, this isn't the appropriate procedure of making submissions about a witness's statement without putting propositions to the witness, particularly where counsel gets it wrong. Nowhere does he give the name of Gacumbitsi's driver as being Seduka, who is now in Kibungo. This is the driver of a different vehicle altogether.Let counsel put the propositions to the witness and elicit an answer from the witness, rather than making a submission on the record.

            <p>With all due respect, the driver of the Daihatsu doesn't matter. "In the convoy of three vehicles, apart from Gacumbitsi, who else did you identify?" His answer today was, "No one, because they were going very fast". Apart from Gacumbitsi, today he did not identify anyone. That is the matter at hand.Four or five years before he identified Gacumbitsi's driver and gave a name. This was the clarification that the Defence wished to make, Madam Presiding Judge. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness TAK, I just have three matters that require clarification this morning, which arose during cross-examination by learned counsel for the Defence yesterday afternoon. Now, Defence Counsel, yesterday afternoon, referred you to the statement you made to the Rwandan judicial authorities on April 8th, 1998, and referred to a paragraph or an answer in your statement in which you state that Kanyagote had with him three children on the occasion you met him. Counsel, however, did not give you an opportunity to clarify why in your evidence on oath you said Kanyagote was with two children. Would you please clarify to their Lordships why your statement refers to three children and your evidence-in-chief refers to two children?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-tak">
            <speaker>WITNESS TAK:</speaker>
            <p>In my statement of April 8th 1998, I never said that Kanyagote was with his three children. I remember, even though this took place a long time ago, that I said to the person who was interviewing me, in answer to their question which was, "How many people -- persons were with you on that day when we went to Gacumbitsi's", I said, "I was with three persons", and I was referring to Kanyagote and his two children. I never said that there were three children. I think the person who wrote down my statement either did not understand properly what I said or did not write my statement down properly.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Witness. Now, again during cross-examination by learned counsel for the Defence, he also referred to your statement concerning a driver by the name of Seduka who is now in Kibungo and did not give you an opportunity to clarify whether the said driver Seduka was the driver of Gacumbitsi. Would you please clarify to their Lordships whether indeed this was the driver of Gacumbitsi or the driver of the Daihatsu?</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, Your Honour, in my cross-examination I never asked the witness yesterday if Seduka was Gacumbitsi's driver or of any other vehicle. In my cross-examination following examination-in-chief the witness stated that he noticed in the convoy -- he noticed that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was in the convoy. During cross-examination I asked him, "Well, didn't you also see Seduka, since there were three vehicles in the convoy?" He explained to the Prosecutor and myself saying that the vehicles went very quickly, and I never claimed that the driver was Gacumbitsi's. But the point was to determine how many people he had recognised in the convoy. Examination-in-chief he said only Gacumbitsi; cross-examination he said only Gacumbitsi; and that is when I reminded him that in 1998 he mentioned the name of the driver Senduraka <stage>(sic)</stage> -- the Daihatsu driver. If the Prosecution wants to ask questions, then he should not state incorrectly what I stated in cross-examination, because otherwise there would be no point really, it would be completely illogical. The Prosecution said he wanted to know how many people he recognised in the convoy; he said one, because the convoy was moving too rapidly. </p>

            <p>Your Honours, the record is very clear. In fact, Madam President intervened and she said, and I quote, "Yes, Counsel, you are lengthening the debate by making clarifications that are not -- in fact, the driver you are referring to in the witness statement is the driver of the Daihatsu." There was confusion on this point created by Counsel for the Defence who was making comment and did not allow this witness, who is testifying, to put a clarification on the record. And that is all I seek from this witness. If you look at the record, Counsel did not use the proper impeachment procedure, he just read something onto the record and made comment without allowing the witness to clarify. And this is a very, very simple point, Your Honours, if I could be allowed to proceed.</p>

            <p>Good morning, Witness TAS. In a moment you are going to make your solemn declaration and you will be questioned by the Prosecutor, and then you will be cross-examined by Defence Counsel. It is possible also that Judges put to you some questions for clarification. Since you're a protected witness, ensure that you do not provide in open session any information which may assist anyone in identifying you. We are now going to take your solemn declaration. Can the Witness be assisted, please, by the court clerk. </p>

            <p>We thank Witness TAS and the court officer. Madam Prosecutor, you have the floor for your examining -- examination-in-chief of this witness.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. There is one preliminary matter to attend to. In respect of this witness, the Prosecutor will be seeking two closed sessions. The initial closed session is to deal with the usual preliminaries, and in this case the proposal that we put a sufficient -- a form to the witness for her to read and confirm is not an appropriate procedure given her levels of literacy; she is unable to read Kinyarwanda sufficiently to be able to make an appropriate confirmation for the Court of the details. The second closed session that I will seek is at the conclusion of the witness's evidence. The application is made on two grounds: First is that part of the witness's evidence is extremely sensitive and personal in nature and relates to sexual assault; and, second, and probably a more concerning factor for the witness, is that one of the men involved in the event has been released from prison in Rwanda and is living in her community. She's concerned that publicly revealing the circumstances of the event would have the natural consequence of leading that person to recognise the witness and thus may result in her identity being revealed, not only to him but more widely in her community. The application is made in respect of both closed sessions under Articles -- under Article 21 of the Statute and Rule 75 and 79 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. In relation to the second closed session, the Prosecutor particularly relies on Rule 75 <stage>(B)</stage>
              <stage>(iii)</stage> which provides for appropriate measures for the protection of vulnerable victims and witnesses.</p>

            <p>Yes. I said that I met a man called Gakobogo. He was with his two sons. I was going then on my way to the market, and they told me what was happening Nyakarambi -- what the situation was in Nyakarambi. They told me that they had sought refuge at the commune office with people from Rukira commune, and people from Nyakarambi as well as people from Birenga. And they told me in addition that Gacumbitsi has just chased us and told us to go home. And for those who live a bit far from the communal offices, he told them to scatter throughout the countryside, disperse themselves.</p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Lordships, would the Trial Chamber allow me to read the witness's statement of Witness TAS, page 4 of the French. It is dated the 28th of November 2000, second paragraph, I think, beginning with the words, "On the 8th of April." It appears to page 3 of the English, third paragraph: "On 8 April 1994 we panicked when we learned, still over Radio Rwanda, of the death of prime minister Agathe, and other high ranking officials in the country. The main reason behind our fears was that all of those who had died were Tutsi.""-- were Tutsi. We therefore decided to barricade ourselves at home until 13 April 1994." Witness TAS, do you recognise this statement?</p>

            <p>Madam President, this is a bit bothersome to the Defence. That question had never been asked and no house was burnt in the commune where the witness was, ever. So we can check our notes all of us. There was never mention made of any houses burnt in Rusumo on Thursday the 13th. So why is the question being asked now? Something is amiss, Madam President.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, this matter was directly raised by the Defence counsel in his cross-examination. He asked the witness this question: "Wasn't he," meaning Gacumbitsi, "Asking the people to make sure that there would not be similar fires in his commune?". Defence counsel has opened the door in his cross-examination, and I am entitled to re-examine on it by asking the witness whether she heard any specific statement made by the Accused. The Defence counsel seems to misunderstand the purpose of re-direct. It is an issue which was opened in cross and the Prosecutor is perfectly entitled to re-direct on it. Now, in this case, he put a proposition to the witness. He asked her to interpret what the Accused was saying. He has asked her -- he has given here an opportunity to determine what she thought the Accused was saying, and it is up to the Prosecutor to ask her whether he expressly made any comment. There no basis, in my submission, for the objection, and there is no basis for similar objections made by the Defence counsel when the Prosecutor is re-examining.

            <p>Yes, absolutely. Trial Chamber asked us, I think it was last Friday, that we should conduct the proceedings in courtesy -- to continue the proceedings in a state of courtesy as we started, but really, as a human being, I can bear being criticised, but to be told that I said something that I did not say, I will react most vigorously to that with my last ounce of strength. I did not mention that in cross-examination, and I don't see why the re-examination should be in respect of a matter that I did not raise, and I beg the Prosecution to be as courteous as we have tried to be since the start of the trial. Every time I make a mistake, I am told that I don't know the proceedings. But I must say, under your supervision, Madam, that one, two, three, four, five times sooner or later, is too much, and what I have been showing is courtesy towards the Prosecution. I would ask them to do the same.</p>

            <p>Madam President, the Defence is horrified. I believe I stated yesterday that this procedure should take place in an open and honest manner.

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Absolutely. My learned friend on the opposite side of the courtroom wrote me as follows: "Dear Counsel, Copy made to the Judges of Trial Chamber III in the Gacumbitsi case. Witness TAP has stated that she might have additional evidence to provide linking Gacumbitsi to sexual violence. However, the witness has been traumatised and cannot speak about the events openly. And as we are not fully informed of her allegations at this stage, we shall not lead questions in examination-in-chief." "We shall not lead questions about this matter in examination-in-chief. This additional disclosure is done by the Prosecution pursuant to Article 67 <stage>(D)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Sincerely," dated 4 August. And today, contrary to all of our expectations, Madam President, the Prosecutor who had promised that they would not address measures that were disclosed are being lead into examination-in-chief, and this is actually what is happening. Madam President, Witness TAP should not have testified today. You will remember, Madam President, and in order for her not to appear, we were -- submissions were made and we will have to come back about these submissions, but at the present stage, we wish to energetically object to this way of proceeding. I don't know if, indeed, complimentary copies were given to the Honourable Judges of the Trial Chamber and to the Presiding Judge; if not, I can give a copy of my letter to the registry so that it can be -- so that you can see the document, because it says on my letter, at least, that copies were given for information to the Judges of the Trial Chamber. </p>

            <p>I did, Madam President. You were served with copies -- or rather your assistant was served with copies at the same time you were on the 4th of August. And subsequently a document was filed -- the same document was filed with the registry. This is a one-page letter from the Prosecutor to Defence counsel, copied to Ms. Talon and also to the Honourable Judges of Trial Chamber III. You were also served this morning with a copy of the related and subsequent letter which I went to great lengths to explain to Defence counsel last night, by telephone, when he rang me and which I served on him last night. Evidence of that service is his signature at the bottom of the letter, dated the 5th of August 2003. Do Your Honours have copies of both of those documents now? </p>

            <p>Yes, Your Honour, but I do have a French Version. Defence counsel was served with a French version.

            <p>I respectfully submit to the Chamber that the whole questioning on these matters be struck off the record, Madam President, Your Honour. Madam President, the letter of 4th August is one of unilateral commitment which the Prosecution is making for not examining Witness TAP in examination-in-chief. The other letter refers to Rule 67 <stage>(D)</stage> as does the one of 4th August. And it says that we are obliged to disclose to you the evidence we have just received. Madam President, apart from the documents which you have received, Defence has no other document, and I repeat, no other document. I have said, and I have a memo to that effect, we have received two letters in four copies in English and in French on the 4th of August, and the French version on the 5th of August. And I think this is what I can say in regard to the acknowledgment of receipt of said documents. Further, Madam President, I do presume that the targeted Rule 67 speaks of evidence and any new evidence that the Defence or the Prosecution may come by subsequently, and each party would place at the disposal of the other, in other words, reciprocal disclosure. If the Chamber is of the opinion that the two letters of 5th and the 8th August constitute adequate notice of such; that would be fine. But the -- Defence would say that this has absolutely nothing to do with the investigations of the matter before your Chamber, Your Honours. And we believe that the examination-in-chief of this witness on this matter should purely and simply be struck off the record.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>We - - Mr. Kouengoua. Madam Prosecutor, do you wish to respond to those submissions made by the Defence? Do you wish to respond to the submissions made by the Defence, Madam Prosecutor?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Madam President, I do. The first points I wish to make are procedural. It's unfortunate that in a forum such as this, it is necessary to correct misrepresentations that are made for the record; that the submissions made by counsel are incorrect and need to be rectified. The Prosecutor served Defence counsel on the 4th of August after this proceeding adjourned for lunch with a letter, a copy of which you now have in French and English, putting him on notice that Witness TAP was traumatised, but had revealed to some extent that she had evidence implicating Sylvestre Gacumbitsi in sexual violence. At that point, her state of being didn't enable her to disclose the particulars of the offender. The Prosecutor immediately advised the Defence, as is required, under Rule 67 <stage>(D).</stage> The letter was given to Defence counsel in English and the content was interpreted to him. He said he understood what the letter was saying. The most important aspect of that letter, apart from the information concerning new evidence, was the caveat, that as the particulars were unknown, the Prosecutor wouldn't lead the evidence. On the 5th of August, last night, when I spoke to this witness, she revealed the allegation that she has made today concerning Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, and that is, that he raped her. I immediately advised Defence counsel and he assisted in this regard. He telephoned my colleague, Mr. Karegyesa, while I was present and Defence counsel asked whether this witness would testify today. I advised him that she would, and that we knew the allegations, the particulars of the allegations she was making against the Accused. In order that he would fully understand the picture, I located an interpreter who told him on the telephone that the witness had revealed her allegation of rape against the Accused, and that now we knew about the allegation, we would be leading it in evidence. Elaborate arrangements were made to meet Defence counsel last night. The letter was written in English and translated into French to ensure that he would understand the contents of the letter. You can see on the bottom of the letter of the 5th of August 2003 that Defence counsel signed the letter at the new Arusha Hotel at 8:30 p.m. He told me that he didn't have his glasses and couldn't read it. And I reminded him of our telephone conversation not an hour before where he had heard the information in French first hand. He has since had more than 14 hours to read the French version. Andressing the law on this matter, Your Honours, it's the Prosecutor's submission that there is no basis for the exclusion of this evidence. The Rules provide for ongoing disclosure and Rule 67 <stage>(D)</stage> is the provision that was relied on for the disclosure of this new material. It's clear that given the provisions in the Rules for ongoing disclosure, it is anticipated that new evidence may arise throughout proceedings and that that can be brought before the Trial Chamber. Rule 89 <stage>(C)</stage> of the Rules of this Tribunal and, in fact, Rules 89 <stage>(A)</stage> and <stage>(B)</stage> anticipate that this Trial Chamber can hear evidence, and may admit evidence which is relevant and which the Trial Chamber deems to have probative value. Further, the Rules stipulates that the Trial Chamber is bound to apply Rules of Evidence which bears favour - - a fair determination of the matter before it, and which are consistent with the spirit of the ICTR statute and general principles of law. It's the Prosecutor's submission that if there is any basis for Defence counsel's objection at all, it is simply that he hasn't had sufficient time in order to prepare his cross-examination, and that is a matter simply remedied. Before almost every witness in this case, Defence counsel has requested a break, and there is no reason why, subject to Your Honours' ruling, he couldn't have an extra 15 minutes to prepare his cross-examination. If he has concerns about the late disclosure of the allegation by the witness, then those are matters that are rightly put in cross-examination. There is nothing to exclude this evidence from being put before the Trial Chamber. The emphasis of this Tribunal is always on oral testimony of witnesses. In my submission, Your Honour, counsel has made out no basis for his objection to have the evidence excluded, and if he is simply requesting more time, then the Prosecutor would not object to that application. That concludes my submissions.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I am taking the Prosecutor word-for-word. She wrote two letters, as I said, on the 4th and the 5th. And in those two letters, she indicated -- she referred to Rule 67 <stage>(D).</stage> I think, for obvious reasons, she did not read that Rule, and I can do so, Madam President: "If either party discovers additional evidence or information or materials which could have been produced earlier pursuant to the Rules, that party shall promptly notify the other party and the Trial Chamber". Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Defence, but I am speaking before the Chamber. I have just received these documents. You have just received these documents. Reference is made to Rule 67 <stage>(D),</stage> I don't think that I have been given any piece of evidence at all. The Rules says, "Which should have been produced earlier; which should have been produced earlier". Given the difficulty the Prosecution has had in using Rule 67, she has had to have recourse to Rule 89. But Madam President, Your Honour, you know that, as you have seen this morning, the Prosecutor is trying to put questions to the witness regarding a new -- regarding the conversation that they have had, something which we have not been notified of. As for a protected witness, this -- this is information which should have been disclosed to us 21 days before the appearance of this witness, Madam President, Your Honour. And I have said before this Chamber on several occasions, I don't have anything against practice, but what does practice have to do with the law and justice? You ruled that the information concerning this witness should be disclosed to me at least 21 days before she comes to the Bar. Today we are been brought a letter and you are being told to consider such as additional evidence, which has been discovered. I don't think that this is normal, and it's not even loyal. The Prosecutor is reproaching me for having signed the letter at 8:30 p.m., but this is loyalty. I was told that -- Witness TAP could not appear on the 4th. The Chamber is being told, and I don't know why. Now, I am asking Mr. Karegyesa who I happened to meet, and I am saying what will you be saying when she comes there? And in 35 minutes, I was supposed to leave the Court and I called him and he said that that was the situation. Nothing was translated in the form of evidence, Madam President. If it was translated over the telephone and I didn't understand, I should have been given the original. That didn't exist. The information which I was told of, of the extra interview with Witness TAP was not communicated to me. So we have nothing tangible. We cannot operate in this way, Madam President. Furthermore, the letter from the Prosecutor, I believe, I mean that one of the 4th -- that of the 5th, Witness TAP has disclosed to us relevant evidence against your client and it's not contained in her witness statement, and we are talking, indeed, about relevant evidence. If this evidence is important, she should produce -- proceed as she has done before. She should have documents which should transmit to us. She has got important evidence and she is keeping it to herself, and this morning she comes just before the witness testifying with the letter. The procedure, Madam President, Your Honour, which is described in Rule 66, which deals with disclosure of materials. Rule 67 also, concerning the disclosure the Prosecution needs to make, does not require that there are things understood without them being spelt out. We are not looking for camouflage and we do not want to surprise the other party. The evidence should be presented in a lawful manner. Madam President, Your Honour, this is the first time, I believe, that we will be obliged to question a witness before the Tribunal before knowing the background to her testimony. Normally this person has already provided a statement which she signed and is with the Tribunal, and has been disclosed to the Defence. I state and maintain, I reiterate that these two letters do not constitute additional evidence, Madam President. Given that, no examination-in-chief or cross-examination should be base on those two documents. I was of the impression, and I did say that that was the case with the Tribunal that internal communications should be without any hindrance, it should be convivial. But it was at night, I was tired and I was having this letter translated to me, and it was being purportedly said to be evidence. I am sorry, Madam President, Your Honour, I believe these two documents do not fall within the ambit of Rule 67 <stage>(D).</stage> And this is what we would wish to say in reply to the submissions made by the Prosecution. Thank you, Madam President, Your Honour.</p>

            <p>The Trial Chamber will therefore render a decision. The Trial Chamber is aware that it is impossible for the Prosecutor to disclose information that it had no knowledge of, which seems to be the case -- which seems to be the case. Therefore, the Prosecutor seems to have respected Rule 67 <stage>(D)</stage> of Rules of Procedure and Evidence by disclosing as soon as possible the new allegations. Moreover, the Trial Chamber is aware of the rights of the Defence to obtain preliminary disclosure of all allegations that are going to be made against the Accused during the trial. In the interest of justice, the Trial Chamber orders that the full testimony of Witness TAP shall be heard and will decide subsequently whether or not the new allegations will be received and under what conditions? Thank you. I would now like to ask the Prosecutor, Madam Mobberley, to continue with the examination-in-chief of the witness.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. Before we begin the cross-examination per se, as everyone has seen, the Trial Chamber has taken a decision -- I would like to take into consideration the decision rendered by the Trial Chamber. The Trial Chamber decided this morning that it would subsequently decide if the new allegations made today will be accepted or not.Madam President, Your Honour, I believe that a cross-examination can only be done properly if the Trial Chamber decides at this stage whether or not it accepts the testimony given by the witness this morning or not, and for the Trial Chamber to be able to render a decision, this is because the justice that is rendered by the Trial Chamber -- this is a trial which is part of the human rights international criminal law.I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention and the attention of the presiding Judge to the fact that this morning the Defence raised a motion -- an objection, and in answer to them, Madam President, it was clearly stated by the Prosecution that as soon as the information was made available to the Prosecution with respect to the allegations of rape, we were informed of these allegations that same night. Before today's date -- before the 4th of August, the Prosecution stated that Witness TAP had not fully stated what they had to say -- what she had to state. And as far as I am concerned, 8:30 p.m. last night, at the new Arusha Hotel, I was informed of this, and the Trial Chamber was informed this morning that Witness TAP unveiled that she had been raped by Gacumbitsi.The letter is before you. This morning, Madam President, before you rendered your decision you asked the witness: "Witness TAP, can you tell me when you mentioned to the Prosecutor the allegation of rape against Sylvestre Gacumbitsi for the first time?"The answer given by Witness TAP was: "I do not remember the date."Presiding Judge: "Did you understand the question, Witness?"Answer: "Could you please repeat the question, Madam President -- could you please repeat the question?" Madam President: "I asked you if you could tell us on what date you mentioned to the Prosecutor for the first time, either to Mr. Karegyesa or to Ms. Mobberley, the rape that you are accusing Gacumbitsi, the Accused, of having committed. Can you tell us what date the act was committed?The answer: "I do not remember the date, but I can repeat what I stated to the Prosecutor." Madam President, after the objection - an interruption, rather, raised by the Prosecution,Ms. Mobberley, the presiding Judge asked again: "I was referring to the rape referred to this morning, that she is accusing Gacumbitsi of having committed. I am asking about that rape. I am not asking about the rape mentioned earlier, the rape she is accusing the Accused of having committed."Madam President" -- this is the witness' answer " -- I made the statement today in the courtroom. This was a secret I was keeping inside. That is why I wanted to write it down on a piece of paper, and that is why I wanted to make the statement here in this courtroom."Madam President, Your Honour, you have available to you two pieces of evidence that cannot be distorted in any way. You have two letters filed by the Prosecution. You have the answer given by the witness, one of the two pieces of paper where the witness wrote that. It is very clear, and Gacumbitsi should know.</p>

            <p>I am sorry, Madam president. It must have been a slip of the tongue. I was saying that between these two statements there must be some truth, and I respectfully request the Trial Chamber to tell Gacumbitsi if it accepts the new contradictory statements -- accusations made against Gacumbitsi at the last minute so that Gacumbitsi should know, pursuant to Article 20 and any other provisions in the Rules, that state that the Accused must be aware of all the accusations made against him, otherwise this will open the door for people who will come into this courtroom to state anything that they please.After this, Madam President, I shall sit down.

            <p>I am sorry, Madam President, Your Honour. Is the Trial Chamber advising the Defence that they should cross-examine the witness on the new allegations made this morning? We have a decision here before us, and it says: "I will decide subsequently after the witness has answered all of the witness' questions <stage>(sic).</stage> " That is why I made an intervention before I began. And, I respectfully submit, in order not to be mistaken and allow the Trial Chamber to find out if the subsequent is now or later, and I am not asking you to return -- to change your decision.I wish to apologise to the interpreters for the speed which I was speaking.</p>

            <p>That is why I am saying, Madam President, and if she says, if I had done this thing correctly; five brothers -- four sisters and five -- four brothers and four sisters, that is what I wrote down. Sorry, four sisters and five brothers, I believe that is what she said. In any case, Madam President, thank you for correcting my arithmetic, but as she said that she believes that she only has five sisters; she is not sure and I am not sure. And, can I now proceed, Madam President?</p>

            <p>Madam President, cross-examination, just as in examination-in-chief, must comply with obligations, and as far as I am concerned, I am under time constraint. You can see that the witness is doing everything she can in order to avoid answering my questions and time is marching on, and I just wanted this to appear -- to be noted in the record.</p>

            <p>Absolutely, Madam President, absolutely. Madam President, very respectfully, indeed. And before I'm preached at from the other side, when they say that the brothers were in Kigali, I shouldn't be told that "I was at home". I'm not revealing anything at all. These are things which came out in public, in the open during examination-in-chief. I'm avoiding as much as is possible. I'm trying only to go back to the questions which were raised in examination-in-chief: "Where were the sisters?" "At home." "And the brothers?" "In Kigali." "And yourself?"</p>

In that way no one will know where the home is, but if you say something that requires a specific answer, this will cause problems in the records.</p>

What I read earlier -- I'm not referring to the passage about the branch, but I said -- "I bled profusely, then they dragged me to our neighbour's latrine, taking me for dead. The neighbour was not there. Around midnight I left and entered the swamp to bathe. Then I went to the home of an old Hutu woman named Spéciose Kabesime, where I stayed for four days. While there, several persons launched an attack, and people asked, "Are there any snakes here?", and the woman said, "No". Finally the woman fled, and I remained in her house because the RPF -- in parenthesis, Inkotanyi -- were fast approaching. We could hear the firing -- shots being fired. I stayed there for seven days before being rescued by the RPF". Is this passage that I have just read correct, Witness TAP?</p>

            <p>We are not on the same wavelength. I read the statement to the witness; the same statement is before you. Look at page 3, paragraph 1, of the French version, and you can verify this.This is a statement that was disclosed to me by the Prosecutor as part of the exhibits to this case. I have nothing to add. And I thought the Prosecutor was going to tell me what I had changed in the statements disclosed to me by her. I did not add anything, I did not remove anything, Madam President; nothing at all.</p>

            <p>Your Honour, my objection was on a completely different issue. Defence counsel was questioning the witness on the use of words that this morning she wrote down. He had changed his tack, he had changed his line of questioning, and he was saying to her that she was using phrases that today she could only write down, and in fact that is not correct. It was Defence counsel who was using the word "vagina" and asking the witness to confirm or deny. She was saying yes or no. That was the point that I was clarifying.</p>

            <p>Your Honour, I have the record here and can clarify exactly what was said from our verbatim transcript. What I objected to was this question by Defence counsel: "Did you state before the Chamber that you were raped and that a branch was inserted into your vagina? Do you remember in cross-examination you said this morning that you couldn't answer the question because your parents had told you these were things that you couldn't mention".Now, my objection is based on the fact that the witness herself has never used those words. It was Defence counsel who used them, and there is no implication to be drawn from the fact that the witness has only answered yes or no. He is now trying to say that this morning she was unable to answer whereas in cross-examination she has used those words, and that is not the case.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>In any case, I think that we can proceed, since mention was made of both four days and seven days in the statement. As to the words used by the witness, I believe that maybe we have gone beyond this point at the present stage, and I would therefore like to ask you to continue with your questions. </p>

            <p>Your Honour, counsel is making submissions. He is not asking questions. The witness said that she stayed at Spéciose's place for four days, and then she said, "After four days she ran away, and I stayed there". She has repeatedly said that she can -- and I have a verbatim transcript. Question by Defence counsel: "And after?" -- that is, after she saw the state she was in and she welcomed her, heated some water and massaged her. "And after?", asked Defence counsel. Answer: "After the four days she also ran away, and I stayed there".Now Defence counsel is making submissions on dates. The witness has made it clear -- the witness has made it clear that she does not remember dates. It is perfectly fine for Defence counsel to put questions to the witness, but it is not appropriate for Defence counsel to make submissions to the Bench, and that is what he is doing. These are dates that do not arise from the witness's testimony. The witness did not give any dates in her testimony. If he has questions about her statement, he should put those to her. </p>

            <p>After being raped by my attackers, who inserted a tree branch inside my vagina, Athanase was the last to rape me during the attack, then his friends whom I didn't know pulled me away and took me to a latrine belonging to someone who lived there and threw me there. Subsequently, I came out and I went down towards the marsh and I went to the marsh and bathed there, then I climbed up to the small road in the bush and I hid there. That is when the Rusumo commune vehicle arrived and I saw it. Gacumbitsi was inside and there were three policemen. The vehicle came across killers that were wearing dry banana leaves and were armed with machetes and spears. He asked them, "Why did Rubanguka do nothing? There is still much dirt." He told them, "You must work and when you have finished join me at the Nyarutunga -- at the Nyarutunga centre." The vehicle left immediately after and went to the house of the conseiller of Nyarubuye whose name was Isaie Karamage. I went down towards the house of Isaie Karamage, but my intent was to go to the house of the old woman, to the house of Spéciose Kabesime. When I came close to the toilets, that is, near the banana grove, someone spoke to me and asked me who your father is, and I saw Gacumbitsi. I told -- I gave him my father's name and he told me, "Why did your father leave you -- abandon you?" And I answered as follows, "I have not seen him in a long time and I do not know where he is." That is when he asked me to follow him. We went inside the house -- inside Isaie Karamage's house in a room and I felt -- and I got the impression that he used to rest there, so he took out the weapon we spoke of earlier, a weapon used by policemen, a truncheon -- I am mistaken, first he took out a pistol and he told me that he wasn't going to waste a bullet. He told me that he was going to kill me only with his penis. He raped me with the policeman's weapon, with a truncheon, then he raped me with his own penis and when he had finished he told me, "Go, and others shall kill you." I immediately went to Spéciose Kabesime's house, and when she saw me she shivered with fear because I was bleeding profusely. She boiled some water and then she massaged me. I stayed at her house for four days. Subsequently she fled, and the Inkotanyi found me there. They took me to the place where the other persons were and took care of me. They did everything to take care of me and that is how the events unfolded. </p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Lordships, last page, last paragraph but one, penultimate paragraph of the statement - of the witness statement: "I would like to add that I saw bourgmestre Gacumbitsi riding passed in a white double-cabin Hilux, conveying three policemen from Rusumo commune. He stopped in our cellule -- three dots -- for approximately" -- there are no dots in the English. Oh, he is explaining to the typists that these three dots replace a name that he can't mention because it is a protected witness. There are no name and no dots in the English. "-- for approximately one hour. I heard him say, 'What has Isaie done? Elsewhere, they have already worked, they have cleaned up, mopped up and nothing is left. And you, what have you done?' The people said, 'We have worked, there is no one left.' The bourgmestre then ordered the Interahamwe to assemble. He said 'Come along, we shall meet at the centre. I neither saw nor heard what transpired at the centre which was too far away." Witness TAP, what do you say about this statement?</p>

            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, this is not the proper way to impeach the witness. There is no inconsistency in the statement. If Counsel has an issue he wishes to raise, he should put it directly to the witness. If he thinks there is an inconsistency, he should identify it and ask her to explain. She has been over and over and over this evidence. She has been in the stand for nearly three hours without a break. There is nothing in this paragraph that is an inconsistency with what she has said. If Counsel believes there is an inconsistency, can he put it to her concisely? But at this point, Your Honours, I apply for, at least, a break for the witness because it is simply too long for any witness to be in the stand without having some sort of respite.</p>

I didn't ask them for their ID cards, identity cards to determine if they were Hutu or Tutsi. But what I do know is at that time that the Hutus were hunting down the Tutsis.</p>

I should like to remind the Prosecution -- Madam Prosecutor, that Mr. Karegyesa told us that -- he asked the Trial Chamber's permission for Thursday and Friday not to have hearings, because he has other matters to attend for -- in the Cyangugu case, and I think we agreed to his request.

At this point we have a representative of WVSS present, Witness and Victim Support Services, who is -- who has indicated to me that it is not appropriate for witnesses to continue under questioning for extended periods of time without a break, especially when we have a witness who has given evidence of the nature that she has given, and who had been under extensive cross-examination today.

            <p>Your Honours, I have two applications to make this morning. The first application, the Prosecutor is seeking leave of the Chamber to drop Witness TAF from its list -- its witness list. Witness TAF was on the list for this week and ought to have appeared today. So that is the first application we are making, at least to have her removed from the list so that we can dispense with the attendance. Now, that would leave us, Your Honours with Witness TAE, who was listed to testify this week.Now, I am reliably informed, Your Honours, that Witness TAE is currently traumatised by her recollection of the events. She is not in a position to appear before Your Lordships today. And in light of this information I have, Your Honours, I am applying for an adjournment until tomorrow morning, hoping that the witness will have recovered. So our application, Your Honours, is that, rather than compel her to appear today when she is not in the proper frame of mind, if you oblige, allow us to lead her evidence and complete it tomorrow morning. She is a short witness, it shouldn't take an hour to dispose of her evidence tomorrow morning, if she able to do so. I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. Counsel Kouengoua, would you like to make a comment?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I believe that it was either yesterday morning, or the day before yesterday, I made a comment and spoke about the traumatism which Witnesses TAF and TAE have had to bear. Trauma can happen, but I would never request -- ask enough - speak enough about Witness TAP, who was traumatised, hospitalised and who still came to testify and gave evidence. That caused enough problems. Madam President, I would have liked them to tell the Trial Chamber whether the witness is traumatised as a result of the events occurring in 1994, or is traumatised because she has to come and testify before the Trial Chamber. These are Prosecution witnesses. My comments only apply to the presence before the bar. All the incidents have already taken place. However, Madam President, in order to avoid having to speak on several occasions, the Prosecutor stated -- gave us documents in Kinyarwanda on Monday and promised us that we would receive translations yesterday morning. We did not receive them and I would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Trial Chamber that these were confessions of Witness TBK, for which he was examined and cross-examined, I would like the Trial Chamber to ask the Prosecutor if he is going to give us the said documents, because both the Defence and the Bench received only the Kinyarwanda version, and the witness told the Trial Chamber, in his confessions, that he had given the names of those with whom he had participated including - particularly, the Accused. I don't know if we can have this confession now. If that is not the case, Madam President, because this witness will not come back to testify before the Trial Chamber, he is not here, he is in Rwanda, and I would respectfully request that the Trial Chamber keep the Kinyarwanda version, which was written in the witness's hand, as being a Prosecution exhibit, because he didn't ask that the document be tendered. He just asked the Trial Chamber to wait for the English and French versions. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Two points, Your Honour -- Your Honours. The first relates to Witness TAE, and I just wish to bring it to the attention of Your Lordships that the witness is traumatised by having to recollect very painful events that she lived through nine years ago in 1994, events that she had put behind her in order to try and lead her life. This process involves having such a victim - survivor, recounting minute details, memories she had tried to put behind her, and it does cause some distress. It ought to be brought to your attention, Your Honours, that this Tribunal, unlike the sister Tribunal in the Hague, does not have psychotherapists or counsellors to help us cope with symptoms by having such witnesses who have to recollect painful memories. So it is counsel, who are not trained therapists, who are trying to cope. I hope you bear with the Prosecutor in this regard.Now, concerning the Kinyarwanda documents, Your Honours, nowhere on the record did I promise that I would have them translated. In fact, I am on record asking Your Honours to direct registry to have them translated urgently for the benefit of this Chamber, and I am not aware whether indeed registry took this upon themselves. The Prosecutor does not have translation facilities, Your Honours. We try, with limited physical and human resources, to extend courtesies, but they should not be taken for granted. Now, since the Accused's language is Kinyarwanda, maybe he could help his counsel in that regard if the registry has not translated these documents.We did our best to disclose them as soon as we got them. The function of translating documents is the function of the registry, and I am on record asking this Trial Chamber to direct registry to have them urgently translated. I am not aware whether the registry has done so.Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

If the Defence thinks otherwise, they are at liberty to seek -- to have them called before they are recalled to Rwanda. Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>That is correct, we had not admitted the documents, the documents were in Kinyarwanda, and we did not feel it was necessary to admit the documents, and we did not give the order to the registry to translate those documents at the present time. It is up to the parties to determine whether they would like to tender the documents. It is up to you, the Prosecutor, you, Counsel, to tell us whether you need the document, and if the document should be translated, because if that is the case, then I will ask the registry, if they are present -- I will ask the registry to translate the document, or if the party who is tendering the document should ask for its translation.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, I just wish to clarify that, indeed, in the ordinary course of business, statements recorded by the Office of the Prosecutor or intended - otherwise, intended for use in the trial, ordinarily would have gone for translation years ago. This arose in the context of an ongoing trial. The Chamber ordered that if we have come across any documents, we disclose them to the Defence in relation, of course, to a category of witnesses.We got these documents in the course -- in the middle of the testimony of these witnesses, and we were complying with your order and disclose them. Now, we didn't intend to use these statements at all, because as far as the Prosecutor is concerned, these are prior consistency statements. Now, if Defence intends, you know, to use them, Defence can then have them translated. But because we were in the middle of trial, I just asked Your Honours to direct the registry to have them translated. It's not uncommon, Your Honours, for this Chamber to direct such documents that arise in the course of trial to be urgently translated. I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <speaker>MR. HOMETOWU:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, the registry is fully aware that the Chamber did not direct the registry to have the document translated. And the fact also that we are in the course of the proceedings does not shift the burden of having these documents being sent to the language section by the Prosecutor onto the registry. Thank you.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President, Your Honour, what the Defence is saying -- stating - maintaining, and which is not very contrary to the truth, is that during cross-examination of Witness TBK, even during his examination-in-chief, we asked if he mentioned the name of the Accused and all of those who participated in the crime in his confessions, he recognised publicly here that the document was not tendered because it was in Kinyarwanda, and because we were waiting for the French version. This is what the witness said. I said that if we look at the transcript; we can see that this witness -- this document was used here, and, in fact, not only by the witness <stage>(sic),</stage> but also by the witness so that we put the questions to him.I wish to apologies to the interpreter for the speed of my delivery.Yes, Madam President, I was saying that we cross-examine the witness with respect to this document. The name of the document is "Confession made before the Gacaca committee." I don't have the documents in my notes available right here to me, but I believe that the Judge even asked him the question about his confession, and put a question to him on that point with respect for the Gacaca from that point, and, Madam President, the document is the basis on which we put the question to the witness, and the basis of answers he gave to us. And by giving these answers, the witness was trying to tell the Chamber that he mentioned the name of the Accused as the person who was already examined before he even appeared to testify. So now we cannot say if theTrial Chamber wishes to use the document; the document was mentioned to the witness, produced by the Prosecutor, and all of the parties used the document. I, therefore, believe, Madam President, that from this point on the document should be tendered into the record.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, the witness has two statements: there is a statement made to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, in which he mentions the Accused, and there is the document disclosed in Kinyarwanda. We have no objection to admit all the documents into evidence.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>
            <p>That might be the solution, Defence Counsel, that the statement be translated and be tendered in evidence as part of your exhibits. And really, there is no need to recall that witness; the statements speak for themselves. So we can read them and see what is there. You are happy with that, Counsel?</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Lordship, I never asked for the witness to be recalled. I only said that he testified on the basis of that document; his answers were on the basis of that document, and that document is entitled, "Confession made in Rwanda before the Gacaca jurisdiction." Both the Defence and the Prosecution, even the Judges, asked him questions about it. So there is no other way for the document to be tendered in evidence. And, of course, it will be appropriate for it to be translated.</p>

You cross-examined the witness on the statement that he had made to the Prosecutors. So it would seem to me that it's in your interest, because I think you did point to some minor discrepancies. It is in your interest, is it not, to have both documents tendered as Defence exhibits instead of prolonging this debate, in fact, quite unnecessary debate, why don't you put both in?</p>

Now, I conceded to that document -- I conceded to that document only on condition that both statements of the witness, one to the Rwandan authorities, and one to the OTP, be admitted onto the record, because the witness is not here to clarify on the contents of these documents which counsel has placed in issue.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Your Honour, there is. And, in ordinary practice, Your Honour, the witness would have been the best party to do the clarification. Now, in the absence of the witness, his statement should go onto the record, because the statements are recorded by different authorities, pursuing different inquiries. The statement admitted on the record in Kinyarwanda relates to the witness' own criminal involvement; it does not relate to any other person. The statement made to the Office of Prosecutor is in relation to the current indictment against the Accused. So, what you have is a lopsided view, the thing that happened, if counsel had cross-examined the witness and put propositions to him, based on the Kinyarwanda statement, but he didn't, understandably, because he didn't have it. It was produced in court that day, and when I was introducing that statement with others, I said we would be happy if, you know -- to concede to an application to have the witness on record so that they are properly cross-examined on these documents.

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, it is a rather odd and unusual practice arising from the conference here of civil, common law and other jurisdictions. These statements are not depositions. They are not sworn statements. These are statements recorded by investigators, professional investigators, lay investigators, they are a guide to the Prosecutor in leading witness evidence. Now, my understanding five years ago is that they are disclosed, of course, as a matter of routine to the Defence under Rule 66, but a practice evolved to disclose them to the Chamber to enable the Chamber assess whether it was necessary to call all these witnesses or whether the parties could cut the witness list. They are not meant for the Chamber to use and take into consideration, when the Chamber is deliberating, because they are not properly on record. They are not evidence; they are not exhibits. The party wishing to use the statement either reads the entire statement, or a portion on the statement onto the record, or tender it in the ordinary course of impeaching the witness, based on the credit of the witness based on a prior statement. So, the statement that you have on file, Your Honours, are not evidence, and in the stricter sense they shouldn't be taken into consideration during your deliberations and that is why witnesses come here to testify. They testify on oath and you can't go beyond what a witness has said.If I may refer Your Honours to Rule 73 <stage>(bis)</stage> and I quote: "The Trial Chamber or a Judge may order the Prosecutor to provide the Trial Chamber with copies of written statements of each witness whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify, and this relates to paragraph <stage>(D),</stage> where the Trial Chamber, or the designated Judge may order the Prosecutor to reduce the number of witnesses if it considers that the number of witnesses are being called to the same facts. So, it is against this background that the witnesses are availed to the Chamber and for the Chamber to apply their rights to assess whether the Prosecutor ought to call all the witnesses, or whether the Prosecutor should be ordered to cut its list. But stricter sense is that no evidence ought to be considered, unless it is placed onto the record through the testimony of the witness.Most obliged. I hope I have answered your questions, Your Honour.</p>

          <sp who="#judge-reddy">
            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>
            <p>So, presumably, under that Rule, we can say to you, and say to the Defence, that we would like that statement be placed onto the record so that we can weigh up the contention against the content of that statement. Is that covered by the Rule that you have just read?</p>

            <p>Not this Rule, Your Honour, but under Rule 89, you are at liberty to admit it, you know, onto the record -- you know, as an exhibit, so that you can now openly consider it during deliberations on this specific issue.And, Your Honours, under Rule 98, may order either party to produce additional evidence, it may also summon witnesses and order their attendance. So if this is read with 89, Your Honours, are at liberty to admit this document onto the record.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I just heard the additional submissions made by Counsel for the Prosecution. I would like to come back to what he said at the beginning. At the beginning he said, "Madam President, if you dismiss my motion, I will re-examine the witness anew, because the statement was filed in the absence of the witness." In this regard, the practice here, according to the Prosecution, is: "that is the practice," according to the Prosecution. My answer is simply as follow: that documents are tendered with regard to the trial before this Chamber under strict control of the Judges of the Trial Chamber. The witness is not a judge of the document to be tendered into evidence. That is one. Secondly, we have not tendered into evidence any document in the absence of the witness. The Prosecution brought a document at a time when the witness was there, and he promised to give us the French and English version the following day; that is, yesterday. Yesterday, he did not mention the document or confession. This morning he didn't mention it either, and therefore reminded -- brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber at this point in time, the documents -- the confessions and so on, this document is admitted as D01. The Prosecutor says that he can re-examine the Prosecution witness anew. I thought that the same Prosecutor had just said that if Defence want to hear him he could call the witness. But, Madam President, I do not know whether this is the past practice of the last five years; you call the witness, you allow the witness to go and you call the witness again. I think if there is a Defence witness who comes and the Prosecutor wants to cross-examine that witness again, that witness can be re-called. But the Prosecution cannot call the witness; lead the witness in evidence; the witness is cross-examined; re-examined; the witness leaves, and then you say the motion is dismissed; the witness will be called again. The witness <stage>(sic)</stage> at Rule 72 <stage>(C);</stage> "If the Trial Chamber or the designated judge is of the opinion that an excessive number of witnesses are being called to prove the same facts, the Prosecutor can be asked to reduce the number of witnesses. I thought it was at the request of TAE that this Rule could be applied. The Prosecutor answers the Judge by saying, "The statements are the means of evidence; statements are not the means of evidence, statements are not exhibits on the basis of which a conviction can be made. Madam President, you cannot, therefore, be asked to admit them. This is what the Prosecutor said; not me. This is what the Prosecutor said when he answered the Honourable Judge's question. So, Rule 89 cited by the Prosecutor -- Rule 89 paragraph C thereof, Rule 89 paragraph C provides as follows: "A Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value." This Rule should have been considered by the Defence or the Trial Chamber if it had been cited. But the Prosecutor in answer to the question of the Honourable Judge said - well, the Judge asked him, "What is the probative value from the preliminary reports that you filed?" The Prosecutor answered that; "They do not have any probative value, they are not evidence, nor evidence upon which a conviction can be made." I think this answer given by the Judge can be remembered by everyone. At this point in time the Chamber will agree that the Prosecutor has not adduced any argument for the admission of witness statements which he tendered to support this indictment, and, therefore, the Prosecutor cannot have this admitted as an exhibit.Madam President, to go even further, we are going towards the last witness for the Prosecution, What does the Prosecution think of the preliminary report of the other witnesses we hear since the 28th of July? Is he going to come back to tender them into evidence, if he hasn't tendered them into evidence so far, it is because, in spite of the practice, that is not done; those documents are not tendered into evidence.I thank you.</p>

            <p>There are two people in this Court who understand Kinyarwanda, one was the witness who was giving evidence, TKB, and the other was your client. And those documents were given to you; presumably, you showed them to your client and took instructions on them. But I was very surprised when you rose to cross-examine TKB, you didn't put a single question to him on that document, and you have now introduced that document into evidence. So, isn't the Prosecution entitled to clarify the contents of that statement -- of that confession by producing the Prosecutor's statement? That is what the argument is, on that side, and this predicament is entirely your creation. If you had used -- you didn't even show the document to the witness while he was giving evidence. You didn't even get him to identify his signature, absolutely, nothing. And now you are objecting to them producing their statement. I find it very strange coming thus from counsel appearing at this level.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Your Honour. My cross-examination, Your Honours, without contradicting what you said, was based on this document. Not only did I ask for the dates of the confessions, I also asked him if he had given the names of those with whose help he had committed crimes in 1994 in Rwanda. He answered and said -- in fact, he even mentioned the names of certain persons, which names had to be in his confession, and which names he cited in his confessions. Your Honour, when these documents arrived, the procedure used by the Prosecutor through the registry was to disclose them to you and give me a copy. The Prosecutor never gave me the opportunity to examine them. He simultaneously said that they were in Kinyarwanda and he promised the English and French versions the following day. Your Honours, do not forget that this witness was not questioned the same day and at the same time. And I am saying that I questioned him on the basis the -- his confessions. The answers to my questions are contained in the draft. I am not the one creating the predicament. The Prosecutor doesn't object to my tendering these documents into evidence. What the Prosecutor is requesting the Trial Chamber is that the statements given to the investigators on the 13th and 14th should be tendered into evidence, and that is the bottleneck, that is the problem arising. Is it the practice that these documents are tendered into evidence as such? The answer was given by the Prosecutor. In answering you, the Prosecutor said "this is not" - "these are not exhibits or evidence. These statements enable the Chamber to be informed on what transpired."</p>

            <p>This Court is in session. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The Trial Chamber had heard the parties at some length yesterday with respect to Prosecution exhibits. I would like to mention that we received a free translation of Exhibit DO1, as the exhibit was in Kinyarwanda. The Trial Chamber, considering that -- during cross-examination of Prosecution Witness TBK, the Prosecutor disclosed to the Defence a document in Kinyarwanda containing the confession of Witness TBK, before Rwandan authorities. Considering that it wasn't until after the testimony of Witness TBK, that the Defence asked that his confession be admitted as an exhibit, the Prosecutor accepted that the document be admitted on the condition that the witness statement given to the investigators in May 2003 would also be admitted as a Defence exhibit, and considering that the Defence objected to this second document being admitted; order as follows: Witness TBK is called back to testify to identify the confession made before Rwandan authorities, which was admitted as Exhibit DO1; dismisses the Prosecution's motion that the witness statement of -- the witness statement made by Witness TBK be admitted as a Defence exhibit. We therefore order that Witness TBK should come back and testify.Could you bring Witness TBK into the courtroom, please?</p>

            <p>The Trial Chamber wishes to be placed on record that Witness TBK recognised the document numbered DO1 as constituting his confession before Rwandan authorities. I thank the interpreter.I now wish to address the parties as regards what we have now specifically said. Have you got any comments? But we would invite you to be brief inasmuch as we have already expressed the decision we reached.Counsel for the Prosecution, please. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. You will note from Exhibit DO1 that; one, it is a letter by this witness to the Prosecution authorities of Kibungo in which this witness confesses a particular crime, namely, the murder of Ntagozera with which this witness concedes he was charged. This letter,Your Honours, is dated 23rd November 2000. Now, it would be unfortunate, Your Honours, for us to proceed in such a manner without the Defence indicating or justifying why they have placed this document, on the record because we submit we see no contradiction or inconsistence whatsoever. More specifically, Your Honours, it would be unfortunate if the Prosecutor were denied the opportunity of re-examining this witness.We waived the right to re-examine because at the point -- at that point in time we felt there wasnothing to re-examine on. Today however, with the witness in the stand and having identified the document, the Prosecutor requests that she be permitted to re-examine this witness, more specifically on a pro justicia statement that predates this confession, a pro justicia statement made by this witness to the Rwandan Judicial authorities on 6th of April 2000. That is seven months before his confession. This witness made a statement in which he gives evidence against the Accused. It's only when both documents are properly before Your Lordships that you will have an informed deliberation. You cannot have an informed deliberation of the credibility of this witness without taking into consideration his statement made to the same judicial authorities prior to his confession, which statement, Your Honours, is consistent with the statement he gave to the Office of the Prosecutor in May this year. Simply put, Your Honours, we are asserting our right to re-examine this witness on the basis of the opening made by counsel who sought to introduce this document after cross-examination was completed. We are most obliged.</p>

            <p>Good morning, Madam President, Your Lordships. Good morning Counsel for the Prosecution, and good morning, Registry. I thank you, Madam. When Madam President invited the parties to speak, she said -- she specified at the outset that the Trial Chamber had already given forth its decision and that we should, therefore, not speak at length. I think that what had been said here and what can be noted, the Trial Chamber's voice pre-empts all others, and I for my part should merely like to point that -- also that if the witness has been recalled here this morning, that if the document in Kinyarwanda was entered in evidence, so the witness necessarily had to recognise authenticity of the document, which has been done. Secondly, I believe that counsel for the Prosecution had said something very serious. I don't think he probably was aware, but in speaking he said the statements made by this witness can only be credible when you have in hand what he said to the Kibungo state prosecutor's office. He said that otherwise, these statements are not credible. Madam President, Your Lordships, I hope Counsel for Prosecution weighed his words. In other words, the witness he calls to testify, he is now saying he is not credible. I hope he thinks that over. Moreover, Madam, we asked this document to be placed on the record that has been agreed to. We have nothing else to add. I think that is what you wanted to hear from me, Madam.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Just to correct Counsel's misrepresentation of what I said, I am not doubting the credibility of this witness at all. What I am saying is that for Your Lordships to be able to have an informed deliberation about the credibility of this witness, you need to have all his statements to the Rwandan authorities before you, because the two statements serve different purposes. One is his confession about his own active murder, the other is a statement made in connection with the investigation of the crimes committed by the Accused. And because counsel is not justified by Exhibit DO1, he has not impeached the witness. I am a bit at a loss with this kind of procedure. Most obliged, Your Honours. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, we even availed you an English translation of the same document. In fact, initially it was in French, and then we had an English translation for the benefit of Judge Reddy. I have a copy of the English translation and the French translation, and these were availed to you before this witness took the stand, I think it was on Monday morning. These are the documents we received on Saturday from Kigali by pouch, translated over Sunday night, and disclosed to Defence and the Chamber on Monday morning. Your Honours, I am just advised we are in open session and this witness's name was read out in the course of the Kinyarwanda interpreter reading to him the letter. So one, that portion should be expunged from the open session record, placed under seal. And maybe any further discussion that involves his name should be in closed session.

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. First, I still don't know why or to what use counsel for the Defence intends to put to use Defence Exhibit No. 1, but I am suggesting, Your Honours, that in the same manner that you had this witness identify his confession, you could similarly have him identify a statement he made to the Rwandan authorities prior to his confession, and enter it into the record, and you could do that as a Chamber if you don't want the Prosecution to take advantage of the witness's presence.Most obliged.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>
            <p>For my part, let me make it clear that when we made that order denying the right to admit the statement made to the Prosecutor's office, we were dealing with the question of whether you can insist that it should go in as a Defence exhibit. That's really all we were doing. We are not suggesting for one moment that it can't go in as a Prosecution exhibit because it could have different implications. For myself, I see nothing wrong with you now getting the other statements identified so that we have the full picture before us. And as for what use we will make of this statement, I understand the law on the subject to be crystal clear: This is not evidence. The statement can only be used to testify to the credibility of the witness and to identify any contradictions or any variations between the sworn evidence and what appears here. This, or even the statement that you wish to put in, have no other view -- value.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. The Prosecutor has an application. Your Honours, the Prosecutor applies for leave of this Chamber to drop Witnesses TAE and TAN from its list of Prosecution witnesses, and the grounds of the application, Your Honours, are that Witness TAN has refused to travel to Arusha to testify, and this information was conveyed to us by the WVSS this week.You will recall in regard to Witness TAE that we had requested an adjournment yesterday to enable counsel to proof the witness. Unfortunately, Your Honours, the witness is extremely fragile and has been unable to cope with recalling the tragic events of April 1994. She is barely able to speak of her experiences and it would be futile, Your Honours, to subject this witness to court proceedings that she would not be able to withstand. So we are asking for the leave of this Chamber to drop Witness TAE.Now, Your Honours, if leave is granted to the Prosecutor to dispense with the appearance of these two witnesses, we would be left with two witnesses of fact -- TBH, TBG -- and the expert witness, Alison Des Forges, and these three remaining witnesses, Your Honours, can be heard next week and disposed of within our deadline of Thursday, the 28th of August 2003.I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Madam President, it is clear that there is an enormous problem. I notice, regrettably, that the Prosecutor does not keep to his word. Here, openly before the Trial Chamber, he promised me that he would allow me the whole of this weekend to prepare for Alison Des Forges. This is what he said when he asked you for permission, when he would not be here from the 11th to the 15th for Cyangugu. Now is he telling you that TBH, TBG and Alison Des Forges -- well, Madam President, I will finish on Wednesday, as agreed. And then what should I do on Monday? Who should I expect, TBH, TBG or Alison Des Forges; which witness should I expect? Obviously, I did nothing about this enough yesterday when I drew the attention of the Trial Chamber to Witness TAF, TAE <stage>(sic).</stage> Madam President, I said, and I will never repeat this enough, it is not normal that someone should be talking of a shock ten years after. I think this shock experienced by some Prosecution witnesses -- Madam President, I was saying that the trauma, the alleged trauma of TAE, TAN -- or TAE -- TAN is understandable because it is not that easy as TAP <stage>(sic)</stage> to withstand in a short time the change that will occur. Madam President, does the Trial Chamber still accept that this Wednesday, the 28th, this session will come to an end; that is, for the Prosecution witnesses? If that the case, then at some point in time the Trial Chamber should intervene to have the Prosecutor call the other witnesses. This would be submitting the Defence and the Trial Chamber to an impossible task.We were told that on the 28th it would be Alison Des Forges, and that would be the end. Today, we are told that TBH and TBG would come next week, but, in any case, I will finish on Wednesday.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. We have two housekeeping matters to raise -- to address first this morning, and the first is the order of Prosecution witnesses. On Friday, we advised that this week we would call Witnesses TBH, TBG and expert witness Alison Des Forges. We also advised that over the weekend, we would assist the witnesses and may vary the order in which they are called. The Prosecutor intends to proceed first with Witness TBH, and in that regard, there is no variation. However, the Prosecutor does apply to reverse the order of the next two witnesses so that Alison Des Forges would be the second witness that you hear and Witness TBG would be the third and last Prosecution witness for this week and, indeed, the last Prosecution witness for the Prosecution case.</p>

The Prosecutor, having met with the witness, decides -- or has taken decision that it is unnecessary to lead the evidence of this witness for the Prosecutor. As indicated by my learned colleague, Ms. Mobberley, yesterday afternoon, as we normally do, we offer the said witness to the Defence if they so wish. I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. The Defence had stated yesterday that in the present state of affairs they had no objection to the withdrawal of TBJ. Equally, yesterday Counsel for the Prosecution -- I want to use the conditional tense because, in fact, with the permission of the Bench, I had stepped out, but when I returned the Bench reminded me that the expert witness was due normally to appear today and the Counsel for the Prosecution had declared his intention not to examine. Now, I don't know whether counsel for the Prosecution has revised or reviewed its position.</p>

            <p>If I correctly understood Counsel for the Prosecution, he didn't mention the last matter. For the time being, we are discussing Witness TBJ and I was saying that you had no objections. Is that indeed correct? We first wish to settle the question -- the issue of Witness TBJ and then we will come to the matter of expert witness, Alison Des Forges.Very well. The Trial Chamber allows Counsel for the Prosecution to withdraw Witness TBJ from the list. And now we give the floor to Counsel for the Prosecution regarding expert witness, Alison Des Forges.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. We are ready to call Alison Des Forges into the Chamber; however, there are just two housekeeping matters I just wish to draw your attention to. We are not asking for an immediate decision, but we just want to draw your attention to scheduling matters, as it were.Your Honours, the timetable issued by the registry concerning this and other cases before the various Chambers puts the Defence case for Gacumbitsi for the 6th of October 2003, and for purposes of planning to ensure the smooth conduct of the Defence case, Your Honours, there are two issues that merit your urgent attention. The first, Your Honours, is the outstanding witness protection motion which will, amongst other things, set the disclosure time lines for the particulars of Defence witnesses. So that is issue No. 1. We are just drawing it to your attention.The second, Your Honours, is the pre-Defence conference in terms of Rule 73ter. It's important that these two matters be disposed of in fairly short order because of the limited time between now and 6th of October; it's a space of only five weeks. And we are aware that Your Lordships are -- will be busy and engaged before other Chambers in different trials. We would, therefore, request that as soon as we close the case for the Prosecution this week, Your Honours, you issue a scheduling order setting, one, a date for a motion for acquittal, if any, under Rule 98 and, contingent upon any decision arising therefrom, a date for the pre-Defence conference.You will note, Your Honours, that Rule 73ter, pre-Defence conference, involves a number of things with which counsel has to avail the Prosecutor, of course with the direction of the Chamber. And given the limited time between the close of the Prosecution case and the opening of the Defence case on the 6th of October, the earlier these matters are sorted out, the better.Now, as I intimated when I started this morning, we don't -- we are not asking for a decision now. We are ready to call for Alison Des Forges to be ushered into the Chamber. These are matters you can deliberate upon between and amongst yourselves once we have taken the adjournment. I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. I must say that, as regards the Defence motion for witness protection, we have rendered a decision. I signed it yesterday. As regards the other matters, indeed, we know that time presses, but we should like to hear the Defence position on the date proposed on the calendar, which is the 6th of October, in order to give the answer required to all those issues which concern us too -- which preoccupy us.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I am much obliged, Your Lordship. I have taken the floor -- I was going to take the floor to thank the counsel for the Prosecution for anticipating, but this question also adds -- the Defence felt it would not be proper to disturb the Trial Chamber and we should finish with hearing the Prosecution witnesses before raising -- requesting certain issues by the counsel for the Prosecution.In addition, Madam President, Your Lordships, since I have the opportunity, it would be good if the Trial Chamber could organise a conference, even an informal one, Thursday or Friday so as to settle a number of problems raised by Counsel for the Prosecution and take the opportunity, equally, to answer Your Lordship's question.</p>

            <p>Very well. We thank you. We shall tell you if we can hold the pre-Defence conference on Thursday or Friday.Counsel for the Prosecution, you have something to add?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>It relates to the witness, Your Honours, before she is led into the Chamber. First, Your Honours, Alison Des Forges appears before Your Honours under the terms of your decision dated 1st August 2003, in which you admitted onto the record the transcript of her testimony in the Akeyesu case, Case No. ICTR-96-4-T, so we need not belabour anything other than complying with your order and offering her for cross-examination by the Defence. We just wish to note, Your Honours, that her evidence goes to proof of the context in which the crimes alleged were committed in Rwanda in 1994 and, as such, does not specifically address the culpable acts with which the Accused is charged in this trial.The second point is: since Your Honours have already admitted the transcript and the exhibits onto the record, it may be appropriate that the transcript filed with the registry be marked and given a Prosecution exhibit number, and then the witness can be led into the Chamber, Your Honours.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-reddy">
            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, it's an electronic copy, and it's only the charts and maps that are in hard copy. Now, it is the CD-ROM that he filed with our application on the 24th of June this year which is in the possession of the registry that we wish to be marked. That is a certified copy of the trial record, Your Honours, in Akeyesu. That's all we have to say in that regard, Your Honours.We have -- Your Honours, for the purpose of this hearing, we have the transcript on our computer, and if questions arise out of anything purported to have been said, if counsel refers to a page, we shall display it on the screen so that everybody in the Chamber is on the same footing.</p>

          <sp who="#judge-reddy">
            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So maybe if we advise counsel that if he makes any reference to the prior testimony of Alison Des Forges, he should refer to the date, page number and line, and then we will assist the Chamber by displaying on the screen the referred portion. Most obliged, Your Honours. And with that, Professor Des Forges is waiting in the witness room. If the courtroom officers usher her in to take her oath. Most obliged.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, indeed, Madam President. Already with the first point, counsel for the Prosecutor did not confirm what they said yesterday; namely, that they would not be speaking today with regard to Alison Des Forges. I don't think the Prosecutor addressed this concern. Yesterday they said that the ball was essentially in the court of the Defence. We of the Defence -- or, rather, that they of the Prosecution would not ask Alison Des Forges further questions. That is the first point.The second point, Madam President, Your Honours, is that what the Prosecution has just clarified seems to be quite delicate -- or sensitive. The documents of the CD-ROM in the Akayesu trials have been admitted and, according to the Prosecution, it is only on most of what will take place here will be based. Mr. President <stage>(sic),</stage> I don't know why this restriction. If the Prosecutor wanted to talk of any particular things, he could circumscribe them. We are talking of a cross-examination. So on the basis of what I have read, it may -- we may go on to other questions. I cannot be limited to Akayesu's transcripts, whereas, we are in the Gacumbitsi trial. Unless I did not understand the Prosecutor, my understanding is that the Prosecutor would like the Defence -- be limited, so to speak, to the transcripts in the Akayesu trial.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, it is clear that counsel did not properly comprehend what I said. We stand by the fact that we are not going to lead the evidence of Alison Des Forges in-chief; we are offering her for cross-examination by the Defence. That is No. 1. No. 2, nowhere did we suggest that we are restricting counsel to the evidence of Alison Des Forges based on her transcript in Akayesu. She's well published. She has testified in other trials; but we are saying is that with regard to the evidence you have admitted onto record, if counsel makes any reference, we shall oblige and display it on the screens. He is free to cite, you know, prior testimony from the Media trial, from the Military trial, from any other trial or from her books, but the onus will be upon him, if he wants to use her publications or her prior testimony in other cases, to produce that particular document on which he seeks to rely. And I note, Your Honours, that it's coming to the mid-morning break, so we may wish to take the break now, or call her in, have her take the oath and then take the adjournment.

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I heard the Prosecutor at the beginning referring to the case of the judgement. This is what the French interpreter translated. The Prosecutor asked for -- made reference to the judgement in the Akeyesu -- made reference to the Akayesu judgement. I do not know what is meant by that.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>These documents, having been accepted, I think the Prosecutor asked us to assign a number to the documents that have been admitted. And that is why I wonder whether there was not a misinterpretation. The documents that were disclosed and accepted by your ruling are transcripts. They are transcripts; in other words, all that was said at the hearings of the 11th, 12th, 14th, 23 May, and so on, 1997, but not the judgement. But in the French translation which I heard, the Prosecutor was requesting that the Akayesu judgement be assigned a number, and that is what I did not understand.</p>

She is also widely published on matters relevant to these proceedings. Now, what I'm saying is that we have not relied on that, but in the event that the Defence strays into that area, it will be upon them to put to her any documents on which they rely.</p>

            <p>Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. Counsel, you accepted to cross-examine the witness. You have documents that have been tendered; namely, the witness's testimony in the Akayesu trial. The witness, indeed, has written a lot on the events, the events of Rwanda in 1994, in particular. I therefore think that you have a basis on which you can put questions to the witness. It is difficult for the witness to start giving a testimony without knowing exactly what is expected of her. She has so much to say on genocide. Therefore, perhaps you have to guide the witness by putting questions to her. What do you think, Ms. Des Forges?</p>

Now, I have only a few questions -- to ask you questions. Do you think that if I started with 1994, we will -- perhaps we will not finish before December 2003, and this is why -- knowing why you are here today, I thought because my other colleagues had questioned you on the report that you had prepared in relation to their cases -- in my own case, I do not know whether this is deliberate or inadvertent, there is no report, and that is why I asked that, knowing why you came here, can you tell me what is in the -- what is relevant to the case of my client?</p>

            <p>Madam President, I would like to draw the kind attention of the Trial Chamber to the fact that we are in the presence of an expert witness. We are not in the presence of a witness of fact -- or a factual witness. The expert witness appearing before the Court today is of international repute. The witness has all that is necessary to assume responsibility for what she is saying and what she will say. If at any moment she thought that the questions put to her by the Defence were irrelevant, she would have told you whether she intended to or not -- he has not even had the opportunity to respond, and I think by interrupting the Defence counsel and also the expert witness, the Prosecutor is unnecessarily wasting the Court's time.</p>

            <p>History -- that is, the reporting of facts, based upon facts -- does not alter rapidly if the history is well done to begin with. Inevitably, a historian learns more over time if he or she continues to be interested in the subject. But if the original work was solid, then the changes are modifications of detail in most cases rather than a complete change in interpretation. Because the role of the expert witness is to provide a description of the historical context in order to situate the acts alleged to have occurred, that historical context is as relevant now as it was in 1997.</p>

I do not recall having discussed the question at all with the Prosecutor's office.As for the new information since 1997, that information is also a matter of public record and has been presented to this Court in my testimony in other cases.

            <p>Rwanda is situated in a central location on the African continent, one which has historically up until the last few decades benefited from ample rainfall and up until perhaps a century ago benefited also from very rich soil, in part, the result of volcanic activity in the region. Because of this and because of its healthy climate, the region became one of the most densely populated on the continent.The people who settled there came from various points of origin and this -- these various points of origin have been much discussed. The best academic interpretation of early Rwandan history is that people who came from many points came in relatively small numbers over a very long period of time and that, once arriving in the area that is today known as Rwanda and under the pressure of state development, they became organised into the population classifications which we now know as Hutu, Tutsi and Twa.Early interpretation of history -- that is, early twentieth century attempts to interpret history -- overlain by later propaganda created a false image of fixed blocks of people; that is, a clearly defined group of Twa who were supposedly the first residents, a second group Hutu who came later as a single people and settled, and then a third group of Tutsi who came also as a single block at still a later stage and conquered the Hutu.But, in fact, this description of history is not accurate because the cohesion of people into those three groups has been a more recent phenomenon and at the time of the arrival of the original inhabitants the categories that we now use had no relevance. Instead, there were people who had different lifestyles, different means of supporting themselves; that is to say, some were hunters and gatherers; some were primarily pastoralists; and some were primarily raisers of food crops, although they also owned cattle and sheep and goats. But the clear demarcation into ethnic groups and the sense of identity as being members of those groups was a much more recent development.We can say that the consciousness of a division between Twa and the other two groups -- that is, Hutu and Tutsi, as we call them today -- perhaps dated to 400 or 500 years ago, but that clear demarcation into Hutu and Tutsi with a sense of the political relevance of those categories is a late nineteenth and twentieth century phenomenon. That is, the words existed in the vocabulary, "Hutu" and "Tutsi", but they applied to individuals, not groups.Far more relevant in people's lives was the concept of clan or lineage group. It was known by the term "Ukoko", which can be translated genus, kind, species. That term has now become the term that means ethnic group, the very same word. But a century ago people understood it to mean lineage group and not ethnic group. Within each lineage group were people whom we would today classify as Hutu, Tutsi and Twa Over time society was reorganised into the kinds of classifications that we see today. This accompanied the growth of an expansionary state, and it was as the state grew in power and sophistication that society also was reorganised.</p>

            <p>I said that the sense of division between Twa and the other two groups could date back as far as 400 or 500 years but that division as we know it today, as was relevant in the genocide between Hutu and Tutsi, is a much more recent phenomenon. With the state -- with the development of the state there was the growth of an elite. The elite believed itself superior, as all elites inevitably do, but the elite was not a Tutsi elite as we think of it today until sometime towards the end of the nineteenth or twentieth century in the sense of being an exclusive monoethnic group. The state of Rwanda encompassed areas that were ruled by Hutu -- in some cases small states, in some cases large lineage groupings -- and the heads of pockets of autonomy were treated with great respect by the Tutsi ruler.The Tutsi ruler depended upon military chiefs, Abatware, whom we would today call Hutu if we were to look at their genealogy, and that was true particularly at the end of the nineteenth century when there were very violent conflicts among Tutsi in the elite, and they relied upon Hutu as their closest supports in their conflicts with one another. So that, in the state system as it existed when the colonial period began, people whom we classify now as Hutu were not necessarily in a clearly subordinate role. This reorganisation of Tutsi into an exclusive ethnically defined elite and the organisation of Hutu into an exclusively subordinate category of population was a twentieth century phenomenon.</p>

            <p>From the eighteenth century on, the military organisation of the Rwandan state was quite sophisticated. I don't suppose that the Court has the time to go into the details of the military organisation, although it is something that I enjoy discussing. But, in any case, these sophisticated military organisations were sufficient to protect Rwanda from outside attack and to allow the state to expand and to conquer, in any ordinary sense of the word, to conquer and defeat neighbouring peoples. But what is relevant here is that those neighbouring peoples were sometimes Tutsi and sometimes Hutu and sometimes a mixed population. At the same time the Rwandan state and its military force was also a mixed group in that it encompassed Tutsi as well as Hutu. So that, conflict existed; wars were fought; the state expanded, but it was not a simple picture of Tutsi conquering Hutu. There were, in fact, some cases in the reign of Rwabugiri at the end of nineteenth century, who was known as the greatest conqueror, supposedly, of the Rwandan monarchs. There were a number of cases where Rwabugiri was defeated by Hutu peoples.</p>

            <p>Doctor, you spoke of three groups: Twa, Hutu, Tutsi; but now you are speaking of monarchy. Before the arrival of the Tutsi, was there a monarchy among the Hutu?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>The question cannot be answered because there was no time when the Tutsi arrived. The Tutsi arrived simultaneously with the Hutu in some cases. People moved in and out of this region until 1910 when the colonial boundary was fixed. There are cases of Tutsi groups arriving in 1909. There are cases of Hutu groups arriving in 1909. Similarly, there are very ancient movements of both Hutu and Tutsi. So there is no way to say, simply, the Tutsi arrived and brought the monarchy, or the Tutsi arrived and found a monarchy here. What we can say is that states were organised in Rwanda as early as the fourth or fifth century AD, based largely upon extensive ironworking and extraction of iron, rather than upon cattle or agriculture exclusively.By the arrival of Europeans there were a number of states in existence. The larger states had rulers whom we would today call Tutsi, but there were smaller states in existence simultaneously ruled by people whom we would call Hutu. Whether it was the Hutu that was the model for the Tutsi, or vice versa, would be difficult to know. What is most likely is that political structures represented a synthesis of elements drawn from both cultures.If you look for example from the royal rituals that gave the spiritual force to the Rwandan monarchy, you will find that more of those rituals have to do with agriculture and ironworking than with cattle raising, and yet cattle raising was supposedly the domain which mattered most to Tutsi. But the kingship as a kingship reflected agricultural and ironworking origins. And the most sacred symbol of the Rwandan king was not the drum, as was usually thought, but the iron hammer, which the king slept on every night, and this iron hammer was the symbol of the ironworking skills which had been fundamental to the early prosperity of states in this region.</p>

            <p>Madam, you told me that the Tutsi and Hutu practically arrived at the same time. I cannot argue with you. I haven't done any history. I am a mere lawyer. I am merely trying to understand, so forgive me. But not having your report, I have tried to read here and there, and I happened upon an article; I don't know if you have also read it. It's called, "At the origin of the Bahutu problem in Ruanda", and Rwanda was written in those days R-U-A-N-D-A. The author is Stanislas Bushayija. I will spell it out for understanding: B-U-S-H-A-Y-A-J-A -- Y-I-J-A. This was published in the Nouvelle Revue No. 12 in December 1958. And the author states the following: "Many centuries ago, the Tutsi came to plant his tent at the borders of Rwanda. The Muhutu who was in the country had not thought of chasing him away. The nomad had not arrived as a conqueror, arms in hand, nor as a coloniser of a primitive and underdeveloped country. He was a pastoralist searching for pastorage <stage>(sic)</stage> for his cattle, prepared to make all necessary concessions to be allowed to let his cattle graze on Hutu land".Now, you said that the Tutsi came there and conquered the Hutu. Now, first of all, the terminology "Bahutu" -- no, I'm sorry, "Mututu and Muhutu". From what you know, did they exist?</p>

            <p>I would have to say that your summary of my previous statement is not exact, to begin with. But to deal with your final question, I did state not too long ago that the terms have existed for a long time, but what is new in the nineteenth and twentieth century is the political relevance of those terms; that is to say, the importance of groups of people feeling, themselves, to be either Hutu or Tutsi, a sense of identification that has enormous political significance over time.The terms existed previously. The earliest mention I know of is in a seventeenth century poem in which a phrase says, "I will not drink beer with that Muhutu; he is the Muhutu of so-and-so", which would suggest the meaning is, he is the servant of so-and-so; he is a follower of the subordinate of so-and-so and below me because I am a person of the elite.</p>

            <p>Maître, I said the contrary. I said exactly the opposite of what you have just stated. But in order to make myself clear, groups of people arrived, relatively small groups; let us say groups of hundreds of people, certainly not tens of thousands. They settled the country. One was not in the process of conquering the other at that point. Those who cleared the land first were acknowledged to have the rights to that land. Ordinarily they had made some arrangements with Twa hunters who also had rights on the land. In areas where agriculturalists had cleared the land and pastoralists arrived later, they ordinarily settled in intersecting zones, because the pastoral land and the agricultural land were often -- the land best suited to agriculture and the land best suited to pasture were often not the same lands. Where they were the same lands, you had battles.In some cases people we would call Hutu won those battles; in some cases people we would call Tutsi won those battles. It was very complicated, but there was not a time when a single enormous wave of Tutsi swept in and conquered the Hutu. Is that clear now?</p>

            <p>It would be helpful if you could take yourself outside of the framework of the late 20th century divisions. I believe you are suggesting that because the Tutsi, as we know them today, constituted perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of the population, it would have been suicidal for them to attack the Hutu. But what I am telling you is that those divisions were not relevant, and that the conflicts which took place were between Banyiginya and Abega, or Basinga, other groups which were fighting to control land and which were not necessarily thinking of themselves as Hutu or Tutsi, so that the question of the relative numbers of population would have had no importance. There was no political unit in which people would have measured themselves as being such and such a percentage of the population. They would have looked at the people on the neighbouring hill, and if their family group or their nucleus of military power was greater than the people on the hill next door, and they wanted to occupy that hill, of course, they would have been in a stronger position to try to win that hill. But it is not a general situation of percentage of population that is relevant at this time. </p>

So that what had been a two-part division, Twa on one side and groups now known as Hutu and Tutsi on the other side, eventually, under the pressure of state organisation and colonialism, became a three-part division between Twa, and then the Hutu and the Tutsi moving apart into separate status. </p>

            <p>It is a term which seems to me relevant for the late 19th and 20th century and not relevant for the period before then. Let me just give as a small example two groups of pastoralist cattle-raising people who were relatively wealthy, one was called the Hema, and they lived in what is now the northern-eastern part of Rwanda in what is called Mutura. Another group, known as the Bagogwe, lived in the north-western part of Rwanda. In the course of the 19th century, both the Hema and the Bagogwe resisted the expansion of the state. They were what we would call today Tutsi, but they were hostile to the Tutsi state, because the state wanted to tax and appropriate part of their cattle. In the course of the 20th century, and particularly in the last two decades of the 20th century, the Bagogwe, in particular, became attacked. They were attacked by the government as if they were Tutsi, with the massacre of the Bagogwe particularly in 1991, and this has forced them into the mould of being Tutsi, even though 10 years before that time both Tutsi from the central part of the state and the Bagogwe themselves would not have seen themselves as necessarily part of the same category. But now, as the result of political changes and growing identification of the Bagogwe as Tutsi, they have become more or less assimilated. That is something which we have seen in a very short historical period, and that gives us a sense of how ethnic groups are formed. </p>

            <p>The difference can be understood in political terms. These were marginal groups in the sense that they lived on the periphery of the state and resisted its control, but they were cattle-raising groups. I point this out not to complicate your questioning, but simply to try to illustrate that these terms, Hutu and Tutsi, need to be used with a certain level of subtlety. </p>

What did they do with respect to the Hutu, the Tutsi and Twa? A moment ago you said before the colonialists arrived there was no problem, the distinction was Hutu-Tutsi against the Twa. With the arrival of the colonialists the division changed. Can you explain to the Court how, and what the change that occurred was?</p>

            <p>Both the Germans and the Belgians wanted to rule at the least cost and greatest possible profit. They were pleased to find an existing political system, which they then sought to use for their own purposes. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Sometimes the Rwandan authorities instead exploited the colonial presence for its own interests, often without the colonialists being aware.The people who came from Europe came with racist ideas that caused them to seriously underestimate the sophistication of the system in front of them and to seriously underestimate the political skill of the Rwandans with whom they dealt. The Germans had a very small number of administrators, at one point seven, I believe, civilian administrators, and allowed the Rwandan political system to function without many changes. The Belgians had a somewhat larger number of administrators, but still in the vicinity of perhaps 100. They sought to tidy up the system in Rwanda. They believed that they were continuing to use the system they had found in place and were simply making a few small changes to make it easier to control. But, in fact, the changes they introduced had long-term consequences, particularly for relationships between the elite, which became known as Tutsi, and the majority of people, who became known as Hutu.The pre-existing system had involved a number of competing authorities under the king. The king used these various rival subordinates under his control in order to maximise his own power, but at the same time the multiplicity of authorities gave the ordinary people opportunity to seek protection from various important patrons. This led to the establishment of the system known as ubuhake, or clientage. The Europeans eliminated the multiplicity of authorities and created a simple Cartesian kind of outline of the administration, where you had the king, and then you had a chief, and then you had a subchief, and that was it. The simplification of the system meant that ordinary people had fewer opportunities for redress if they felt they were being oppressed. At the same time, the colonial authority made it impossible for people to move around.Simply moving to another area had been a usual way of escaping excessive demands from a superior. People would move to a new part of the forest, clear new land and then be more or less masters of their own fate, or they would flee into another area and become temporary labourers. In general, the colonial administration made this impossible, so that the little guy was pinned down in a way that had never happened before and had fewer opportunities to seek help from powerful people in the system.To compensate for this the Europeans created a system of courts which were supposed to protect ordinary people and to protect their rights, but because the judges in the court system were of the same ruling elite, most of the judgements went against the poor plaintiffs.At the same time as making these changes in the system, the Belgians applied a criteria of ethnicity for admission to schools and for administrative posts. They did this not to divide and rule, as many colonial rulers did; I think they did it as a simple reflex of their own racism. When they arrived in Rwanda and they saw a political structure with a king who was Tutsi, they believed that the Tutsi were more like themselves in the physical -- in the characteristic physical type of Tutsi; they look more like Europeans, and so this suited the European concept. They believed, "These people are more like us, hence they must be superior to those others", and they then decided that Tutsi would be the sole rulers in Rwanda. Because secondary education was meant to prepare young men for service in the administration, places in secondary education were also reserved for Tutsi. It became complicated, because up until that time the categories were very fluid and depended on genealogy. In order to simplify the situation so that administrators would not have to each time determine whether a candidate for a place in school or a candidate for an administrative post was in fact Tutsi, they decided to impose a system of population registration which would decide the issue once and for all, and put it into writing. So in the 1930s they established a system of population registration and required Rwandans to carry identity cards indicating whether they were Hutu, Tutsi or Twa.So you have several changes happening in a very brief period of time. You have a change in administrative structure that makes it more possible to exercise direct and repressive control on ordinary people, and you have the reservation -- the exclusive monopoly of power delivered into the hands of Tutsi. So that Hutu who had had positions of power -- for example, the ruler of Bushiru, a small state in the north-west which was the homeland of President Habyarimana, the ruler of Bushiru was eliminated, and his territory was taken over by a Tutsi chief. So that the pockets of autonomy and the leeway in the system were removed in order to create what was a much simpler structure.The Tutsi who received this monopoly of power used it to increase their control. One objective of the Europeans was to make it possible to demand accountability from chiefs and subchiefs for certain infrastructure projects which they wanted to see done -- the building of roads, the planting of cotton, the planting of certain food crops -- and the chiefs and subchiefs used these new regulations to impose additional burdens, for their own profit, that the Europeans often were unaware of.So it was in that context that Tutsi rule became identified as Tutsi rule. It expanded geographically, it extended downward far more intensively, and the consciousness of Tutsi as a privileged people became far more important, and conversely, the sense of Hutu as an oppressed people also grew proportionately stronger. </p>

            <p>You are right, and I thought I had said that the Tutsi, the ruling elite, were extremely skilful in making use of the European presence to increase their own power, and in fact the sentences I just said were a demonstration of that, how the Tutsi used the imposition of colonial burdens to extend their own hold on power and their own wealth. So it was certainly not a one-way situation. The Tutsi were not helpless pawns of the colonialists, they were an extremely skilful political elite that knew how to exploit the situation to their own benefit. </p>

And in 1991 I was asked to do a study of the situation, the political situation in Rwanda, and at that time I pointed out the existence of ethnic classifications on identity cards as a serious problem in the political system, and I counselled donor nations to give no assistance to the Rwandan government until that ethnic identification was removed from identity documents. </p>

            <p>Rwandans were obliged to carry their card -- their identity cards with them. I suppose it was more usual to keep them in the pocket rather than on any other part of their anatomy.If you are asking was it possible to identify people as members of an ethnic group on the basis of their physical characteristics, there are indeed differences in the stereotypes of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, but an individual can often be mistaken if he is judged or she is judged on the basis of those characteristics. This is in part because the population has had significant intermarriage over time, and it is in part because persons took the identity of their fathers and, in cases of mixed marriage, might look like their mothers. So you could have someone who looked Tutsi and who was legally Hutu, or vice versa. And, in fact, a significant number of people were killed in the genocide either because people at barriers did not believe what was written on their identity cards, thought they had been falsified because they looked like they were Tutsi; conversely, there are other people who were able to save themselves because they looked Hutu, even though legally they were Tutsi. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Dr. Des Forges. Therefore, at some point in time one could recognise from the physical characteristics various people. If you came across a Tutsi or a Hutu or a Twa, you could distinguish them. Why do you speak very little of the Twas in your explanations, how the Twas were distinguished?</p>

            <p>I said that there are stereotypical images of these three groups, but I also said that it is quite possible to be mistaken about a person's ethnic identity if one judges solely by his appearance. So it is wrong to say that meeting Hutu, Tutsi or Twa on the street you will know immediately by looking at them what group they are members of.I speak relatively little of the Twa, because I recognise that the time in this courtroom is precious, and I am attempting to be as concise as I can be. The Twa represent a very small part of the Rwandan population, and that has been the case for the last century, so that I endeavour simply to save the time of the Court by not in every case mentioning all three groups. </p>

Both contending groups were Tutsi, the Abega customarily providing the queen mother to the king, the Abanyiginya customarily providing the king himself. In this case, the queen mother, whose name was Kanjogera, K-A-N-J-O-G-E-R-A, and her two brothers, Kabare, K-A-B-A-R-E, and Ruhinankiko, R-U-H-I-N -- R-U-H-I-N-A-N-K-I-K-O, killed the legitimate ruler and installed on the throne Kanjogera's son, Musinga. Subsequently, the Abega killed a substantial number of the Abanyiginya nobility and more or less maintained control through much of the colonial period.Eventually Musinga took his revenge, and the Abanyiginya resurfaced but never regained the same pre-eminence that they had had before Ruchunsu.</p>

And maybe I should add -- in fact, I had stood up before Madam President made her observation.Your Honours have given counsel sufficient leeway this morning, one and three-quarter hours this morning. Now, one of the grounds upon which the Prosecutor moved this Chamber for this mode of proceeding under 92bis <stage>(D)</stage> was to benefit from judicial economies. If we proceed in the manner we are doing now, we would be losing the judicial economies anticipated by Rule 92bis. So counsel should be more specific and should cross-examine the witness. If he contests the opinions advanced by the witness in prior testimony, he should do so; go straight to the matters in issue. I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Madam President, under the control of the Trial Chamber, I did not receive the expert report the witness gave in the Akayesu trial. I did not receive a copy of this expert -- of this reporter. You have deprived me of this report, and the witness has just said that you did not ask her to prepare another report. Well, the only thing that I have are the transcripts of the hearings, Madam President, and I am a bit astounded that counsel for the Prosecution should raise the report made by the expert witness with respect to Akayesu. If I had received this report, then my cross-examination with the witness would have begun with the report.I wrote -- I never received the report. The only thing I received was the transcript of the hearing, which is a combination of what was said by the President, by the Judges, by counsel, by the witness. This represents 1600 pages, transcribed by the court reporters. And in the transcripts that I received as two volumes, I believe the two volumes are here, and there is mention of the history of Rwanda. There is a discussion between the representative of the Prosecutor and the Dr. Alison Des Forges, the conversation between the late Laity Kama, but I did not receive a copy of this report. I initially thought that it wasn't done on purpose, but I am surprised that the Prosecutor should raise this matter at this stage of the proceedings. It is embarrassing.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. After a colonial period in which the Belgians supported the power of the Tutsi elite, without reserve, in the 1950s they began to see the need to enlarge the share of Hutu in the administration and the political system. They introduced several political reforms, and the Hutu intelligentsia, particularly that educated by the church, became more active politically and began to demand an increasing share of political power. The Belgians -- the concessions made under Belgian administration in the end were not sufficient to satisfy Hutu demands, and at the same time, they were too large for some Tutsi, who became frightened at the potential loss of power. The result was a polarisation and the coalescence of a group of Hutu political activists, who arranged for the overthrow, who led the overthrow of the monarchy, and established a republic. The ruler, after some months, fled the country, and along with him, several tens of thousands of people associated with him, most of them, but not all of them, Tutsi. This initial period, let us say from 1959 to 1961, or about 1961, had involved some killings, but not massive killings. That is to say, the revolution itself, the establishment of the republic, was not the occasion for widespread killings on an ethnic basis. The persons targeted were power holders who were indeed Tutsi, but they were targeted because they were power holders and not because they were Tutsi. Hutu associated with them in subordinate roles were also targeted. From the early 1960s through 1967, groups of Tutsi outside of Rwanda organised militarily to attempt to return into the country. It was this period of military activity which led to widespread killings of Tutsi, notably the massacre of some 10,000 in the préfecture of Gikongoro in December 1963 and January 1964. It was in the interests of Hutu power holders -- apparently they saw it that way -- to incite killings of Tutsi at that time. It allowed them to broaden their base of power by killing and driving away ordinary Tutsi, large numbers of ordinary residents, as opposed to the power holders. Those local Hutu government officials obtained control of their land and could then redistribute this land among Hutu, which allowed them to increase their own personal following and base of power. It is notable that at this time the reason given for inciting killings and other attacks on Tutsi was that they were supposedly assisting Tutsi from outside the country who were engaged in military incursions.</p>

            <p>I have not myself done the in-depth studies that would be necessary to adequately describe these killings, but based on what I know at this time I would not call them genocide, although it is clear that the definition of the target was gradually broadening from those people who were power holders, or former power holders, to take on a wider ethnic definition. But even if that is true, and even if the target is chosen on ethnic grounds, that does not, as I understand it, qualify for genocide.In addition to the ethnic targeting, there must be the intention of elimination, and, as I know the information from that period, that was not an element of the 1963-64 killings. One way to establish this is to look at the possibility for flight. The borders were not closed. Tutsi were attacked with the intention to kill or to drive away, and large numbers of people did flee. In contrast to that, in 1994 one of the earlier actions of the authorities was to close the frontiers, to close the borders, to attempt to impede the flight of Tutsi, whether very locally or in leaving the country, and this to me demonstrates a clear intention to fix them in a place where they could then be eliminated.</p>

            <p>May I just ask you a question, and this might be the best time to do it.After the president died on the 7th of April, early in the morning there was a bulletin, obviously broadcast at the request or orders of the government, asking people not to leave their homes. How do you see that? Was that a ploy to ensure that the intended victims would be found in their homes, or was that a wider security measure? How do you view that in the context of the investigations that you carried out? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>It is certainly reasonable to understand that as a general security measure, and were it not for the rest of the context of events, one would be tempted to conclude that it was simply a general measure of order. But given that killings were already taking place on the basis of lists which were residential lists, given that squads were being sent to find people in their homes, and given that Radio RTLM eventually would even broadcast other places where people might be frequently found in addition to their homes, it seems to me that we must understand this as a measure which, for the general part of the population, would be a security measure, but for those persons targeted, which would be not just Tutsi but also Hutu leaders of the political opposition, it was meant as a means to make them easier to kill. In that connection, I would remark that in the early hours of April 7th, the members of the MRND and others closely associated with the presidential circle were, in fact, evacuated from their homes, did leave their homes, and were taken to a place of safety in a military camp. Others in the same neighbourhood who were of the political opposition were not allowed to leave their homes and were killed later that day.So there, I think, would be one example that would support the conclusion that this was a double -- a measure with a double intention, but certainly one of its intentions being to pin the victims down.</p>

            <p>Dr. Des Forges, you have testified that in the year previous, that you did not conduct in-depth studies about the previous period to be able to speak of genocide, and the information that you have available to you today does not allow you to say that it was genocide. As I am here to try and understand, I would like you to explain to me does -- is it the number that characterises genocide or is it something else? You said that 10,000 people were murdered in genocide, but I thought that you felt that this was insignificant in comparison to what happened subsequently.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>I attempt to stay as close as possible to the legal definition of the term "genocide". It is a word which is used far too casually in many contexts, simply to indicate a large number of victims. I use the term in its legal sense, to involve attacks on people of a specific ethnic, religious, racial group with the intention of eliminating them. And as I specified when speaking of 1963 and early '64, because I see no attempt to prevent the flight of people -- in other words, Tutsi were allowed to escape -- that seems to me one indicator that this was not genocide. And I would remark also in that connection the very specific reference in a speech inciting to genocide given in November of 1992 by Léon Mugesera, vice-president of the MRND party, in which he said specifically, "We made a mistake in the 1960s by allowing them to escape. This time no one must escape". And this theme was picked up during the genocide when even babies, infants and young children were killed, with the phrase often being used to explain this, that "Even Paul Kagame or Fred Rwigema was once a child", these references being to RPF military leaders who had, in fact, been able to escape the country in the 1960s. And the obvious meaning being, "You must eliminate even babies and children, because they could grow up to return". </p>

This person did not have anything specific to be targeted, so how can you explain that peasants fled at the time? If they hadn't fled, wouldn't they have been killed?</p>

Some of those associated with power holders included Hutu and Twa, who were their household servants or in other ways affiliated with them. These people also fled the country, and I myself knew a number who were refugees in Tanzania in those early years, who were Hutu and Twa. </p>

            <p>With the beginning of the war, a group of political actors close to President Habyarimana, and at times involving President Habyarimana, chose to aggravate ethnic tensions, ethnic divisions, as a way of solidifying their own power, which at that point was diminishing. They made the choice of using the RPF invasion as a reason for scapegoating or targeting Tutsi civilians who lived inside Rwanda and accusing them of being accomplices or ibyitso of the RPF.This initial choice, followed by many other choices, led eventually to the genocide, but it did not necessarily have to lead to the genocide. This was not an inevitable result. The first decision was followed by many other decisions, and at any point, even until very shortly before April 6th, the genocide could have been averted. </p>

            <p>In 1994 there was a ceasefire in existence, a ceasefire which was broken by the military attack of various forces of the Rwandan army on the headquarters of the CND, the Conseil national de development, in which was housed soldiers of the RPF. Those soldiers came out of the CND and engaged in combat against Rwandan army forces. As best I have been able to determine, the initiators of military action in the circumstance were the Rwandan army forces. </p>

            <p>At the beginning of 1993 there was a ceasefire in effect which was broken on February the 8th by an attack by the RPF forces moving south towards the capital of Kigali. This was responded to by fire from the Rwandan Armed Forces and until sometime in March, I believe the 13th of March, there continued to be exchange of fire between the two forces. After that time there was a new ceasefire and eventually the Arusha Accords signed in August, which ended the war officially.</p>

            <p>The peace treaty was meant to be definitive but, in fact, there were forces on both sides which did not accept this as a final settlement and there were preparations for renewed combat on both sides. Whether both simultaneously engaged in such preparations or whether one side began preparations and this was known to the other that subsequently began preparations, I do not know, but both sides engaged in preparations for further military activity.</p>

            <p>Events throughout the rest of 1993, together with the already existing divisions, led to a realignment of forces within Rwanda so that by the end of the year it had, in fact, become a two-part or bipolar situation and that was largely determined by ethnicity. So it was the passage from a three-part arrangement, which was expected to be stable, to a two-part arrangement based on ethnic hostilities that set the scene for the genocide. </p>
          </sp>
          <stage>(Previous translation continued)... spelling out political arrangements for the transition, guarantees of human rights, the improvements in the judicial system, but it is perhaps best to think of the agreement as a three-part agreement rather than as a two-party agreement. It is true that there were only two belligerents; that is, the RPF and the Rwandan government, but at the time of the signature of the accords the Rwandan government was divided between supporters of Habyarimana and opponents of Habyarimana, and the political arrangements reflected in the treaty were three-part, tripartite, rather than a simple two-part arrangement. It was, in effect, a three-legged stool that was created.</stage>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam, the conflicts to which you allude, were they due to the fact that some Rwandans wanted to return to Rwanda and others did not oppose their entrance into -- on national territory, that they should enter the national territory?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>The conflict which I was referring to in my last answer was considerably later. It was the conflict of 1993 in which political forces realigned to become a bipolar Hutu/Tutsi opposition. The question of return of refugees from the outside was not a major issue at this time.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Certainly, there were ethnic elements to the conflict at that point, but as I pointed out, there were serious divisions among the Hutu which permitted the creation of a three-part arrangement: one part being Habyarimana and his supporters, one part being people inside the government and inside the country who opposed Habyarimana, some of whom were Hutu and some of whom were Tutsi, and the third group being the RPF and its supporters, many of whom -- most of whom were Tutsi. In the course of 1993, that middle group essentially divided and realigned itself with one or the other of the two ends of the spectrum, and it was this polarisation which created the possibility for a genocide.Had the third force remained solid, those radicals around Habyarimana would never have had the strength to carry out a genocide on the scale that we saw in 1994. Their own political power was limited to certain regions and it was only by attracting to their side those other Hutu who had been opposed to Habyarimana personally, that they were able to get the sufficient number to mobilise the population to attempt to exterminate the Tutsi.</p>

            <p>Right.

            <p>Six hundred soldiers of the RPF were at the CND on the date specified, and as I said perhaps 15 minutes ago, the sequence of events was that Rwandan Army Forces attacked the CND and the RPF forces came out and engaged them in battle in the late afternoon. I believe they left the building in the early afternoon, took up their positions around the perimeter of the building and actually opened fire in the late afternoon sometime in the vicinity of 4 p.m.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. The submissions made by the Prosecutor do not seem relevant to me, which is why I did not immediately stand up to respond. The document, I believe the Prosecutor has not forgotten, but this refers to sites that are mentioned in my indictment and in the case and they deal with people who died, with bodies the expert witness allegedly saw in August as she was travelling through the area and that she recorded. These are the same bodies that were produced in the courtroom on a videotape. This is all part of the same site, and the expert witness has just said, to her knowledge, this document is an authentic report, Madam President. This is a document from the High Commission for Refugees of the United Nations. It is not a confidential document and I did not obtain it in any secret manner. It is just a document that clearly states that with respect to the accusations and some of the affirmations made -- the allegations made against my client and in this Trial Chamber, that above and beyond there were murders, killings, in May, June, July, August, September 1994. This is what the document refers to, Madam President, and I have never stated that the Prosecutor was the one who disclosed the document to me. I never said that here in this courtroom. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Your Honour. When we began this trial we were shown images of bodies. This was the first part of the trial. We saw piles of bodies, and the person who allegedly found these bodies, if you will recall, could not even say exactly when they had gone to that specific site. In any case, with respect to the Prosecutor, these bodies were being blamed on the Accused and various other persons. Now, the expert witness has just told the Trial Chamber that she went to those places in August and that she saw bodies there. And Defence counsel asked her if there were freshly killed bodies, and she said, "They were bodies that still had flesh on them, and I recorded them." And in the document I showed the expert witness, Your Honour, it is mentioned where massacres and killings were committed by RPF soldiers and that is what appears in this document, because on the date the expert witness went to the region, the RPF had already been in the area since April, and so these bodies could not have been those that they were trying to blame on my client, and this is the content of the document. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President, a point of clarification. If this document is as I suppose based upon the Gersony report, it would deal with areas other than the area referred to by Defence counsel; that is to say it does not deal with Nyarabuye church, which I believe was the site of the photographs that you have already seen, the videos you have already seen, and the site that I myself visited. The killings that are referred to here took place generally in other areas and the witnesses were interviewed, many of them outside of the country. But the notes that I saw, which I believe were the foundation for this document, did not indicate in any case that the data was drawn from Nyarabuye church. So I would -- regardless of its relevance, and it may be relevant in your judgment, I would simply wish you not to make the decision based upon the idea that this has to do with the bodies at Nyarabuye church because I certainly believe that is not correct.</p>

            <p>I believe Defence counsel is correct in referring to the bodies in the river. As I recall the information from UNHCR, the original information dates from May 17th, 1994, having to do with the appearance of bodies in the river. This occasioned comments by UNHCR agents, because it was several weeks after the arrival of the RPF in the area. But I believe a distinction must be very clearly drawn between the presence of those bodies which were moving down the river and observed by the UNHCR, and the bodies at Nyarubuye. They were clearly from a different period, and there were also other indicators of difference, for example, in the sites of the genocidal killing that I have visited, it is extremely rare to see a victim tied up. And to the best of my recollection, at Nyarubuye, there was not a single person tied up or indications, either in the position of the bones, of the corpses or through the remnants of pieces of rope, as any indication of tying of the victim. Whereas the bodies cited in the river after the month of May, often had their arms bound behind their back. And at one of the two sites that I investigated, where RPF killings were alleged to have happened, the persons who buried those bodies told me they all had their arms tied behind their backs. So I believe there are ways to distinguish, and it is extremely important to do so for the interest of justice and to separate the layers of events so that it is clearly established where responsibility lies.</p>

            <p>It is true that the word appears, but it would be well to have the translation before commenting on it. As I read it in English, and perhaps Defence counsel can listen to the French translation, "At Rusumo commune, secteurs, Nyamugari, Gisenyi, Nyarubuye, the RPF comes at 5 o'clock, waiting for villagers to open their doors. The villagers were caught and taken away to the river by trucks. No one has returned. Refugees of the area have seen people being tied together and thrown into the river. It seems as if guns are only used if somebody tries to escape. At the crossing point, Kinjongo, refugees have to pay a 100 Rwandan francs per bag of commodity, and so-on and so-forth, has to do with the cost of transporting them across the river". This, however, has nothing to do with Nyarubuye church. It says, "People were taken from Nyarubuye secteur towards the river and did not return". Whether there were or were not killed, whether they were or were not thrown in the river, we do not know. The testimony from the refugees is that people were tied together and thrown in the river, but those were not the people whose bodies were in the courtyard at Nyarubuye church. </p>

            <p>In late July 1994, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees commissioned a study to determine why refugees had fled from Rwanda and how they could most easily and quickly be brought home. Three persons executed this study for the UNHCR, Mr. Robert Gersony, G-E-R-S-O-N-Y, his wife whose name I don't know, I presume perhaps Ms. Gersony, but perhaps she has another professional name and Mr. Tony Jackson. They carried out a study for some six weeks interviewing people inside and outside Rwanda. Mr. Gersony began the study with a very high estimation of the RPF army, which he believed to be the best in Africa. That is to say, he began written out prejudice against the RPF. His task was not to document RPF abuses, but simply to find out how to bring the refugees home. After six weeks of study, he and the rest of his team concluded that RPF killings of civilians were, in fact, an important reason why refugees had fled. He presented this information orally in Rwanda, in Kigali, to members of the Rwandan government and various members of the United Nations. To the best of my recollection, the United Nations reacted very strongly. Mr. Kofi Annan, who was then in Addis Ababa on route to Somalia, was sent to Rwanda to deal with this. It was regarded as such a serious allegation. United States government representative who had been in Kigali and gone on to Bujumbura were sent back to Kigali to examine these allegations. Mr. Gersony made a subsequent oral presentation, I believe, in Geneva, and the notes which I have seen come from one or the other of those oral presentations, the information was regarded as potentially extremely damaging, both to the United Nations and to the Rwandan government, and Mr. Gersony was directed not to write a report and not to ever speak of the results of his work, as were the other members of his commission. As far as I know, he has followed this rule. There was a very short summary, I believe, in the order of three pages, and another in the order of perhaps seven pages that were written at the request of the Special Rapporteur, I believe. In any case, the Special Rapporteur at some point had possession of a short document, but another point, I know and I have published in my book, a letter which he directed to the UNHCR asking for a copy of the Gersony report, and the response to him from the UNHCR, saying "There is no Gersony report". Underline. That is why I was somewhat surprised to see that there was, in fact, a somewhat lenghtier document which does present what I recall as being the conclusions of Mr. Gersony and his colleagues. </p>

            <p>While I differ to Your Lordship's wisdom, the Prosecutor has a problem, one, with the authenticity of this document and the allegation made therein. As far as we are concerned, it is clear from the expert witness that there is no Gersony report. So the document before the witness is therefore doubtful provenance. Now, the mere fact that she -- the witness is able to say some of the allegations made therein, she heard before or seen them in rough notes before, does in no way authenticate that document. As far as we are concerned, it could have been written by anyone. It could be from newspapers. I mean, there are allegations abound the streets. And is this Chamber, Your Honours, going to admit onto the record all manner of documents?</p>

          <sp who="#judge-reddy">
            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>
            <p>No, this is not an all manner of documents. This is a document which has received some support from this witness. It resembles what is called, "The Gersony Report", or at least features of it. So there is some connection and the witness is able to testify to that effect. But do you feel comfortable excluding this altogether and exposing the Tribunal and perhaps yourself to the criticism that here was a piece of evidence which was relevant, perhaps marginally relevant and which might be favourable to the Defence, was excluded? Because our task is to admit all relevant evidence, and what weight we attach to that evidence is another matter. That's how I would view this particular document.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, there are two issues here. First of all, there is no Gersony report, so -- and the witness has qualified her identification of the contents of this document. She doesn't know if something could have been, something could have been deleted. So, it is the authenticity and provenance of this document is in doubt. Now, if counsel through his Defence case, can establish the authenticity of this document, the veracity of the contents, that's a different question. But this is not the proper witness, Your Honour, through whom such a document would be tendered. And finally, Your Honours, I still can't establish the basis for seeking admission onto the record. This witness has mentioned the places she visited and she referred to death, in two sites in Gitarama allegedly caused by the soldiers of the RPF, and then she goes to mention Tutsi victims in about eight communes which she visited. Now, on what basis does counsel seek the admission of this document onto the record vis-a-vis the witness's testimony? </p>

            <p>It is often said that my position and that of Human Right Watch has changed on this issue, but I can assure you that our first letter to the Rwandan Patriotic Front concerning allegations of such crimes is dated May the 11th 1994, and that I wrote a report published in 1994, detailing the evidence from my investigation at the two sites I have discussed this afternoon in Gitarama where such crimes were committed by soldiers of the RPF. In that connection, I believe my position has been clear from the beginning, there is, of course, no equivalence in crime between genocide and war crimes and crimes against humanity, but there is equivalence in the rights of victims to justice regardless of the crime committed.</p>

            <p>Madam, at the hearing of the 22nd of May 1997 in the Prosecutor v. Jean-Paul Akayesu, you stated the following, in answer to Akayesu's Defence counsel's question, page 77, hearing of 22nd of May, you said, "There have been charges made by certain diplomats of the Rwandan government and certain groups supported by the Rwandan government, accusations that the RPF slaughtered up to an enormous number of people. I heard a figure of 40,000 and one even perhaps a 100,000 of Hutu at the time of the attack." Page 78, "We made a special effort to investigate those accusations and we have never found any proof thereof, and I would tell you that we investigated not only RPF zone, but also in the government controlled areas in the displaced persons camp, where the Hutu had fled from the RPF advance, and we never found any details or facts that would make it possible to say that the RPF had killed or massacred". This is what you stated and this is April 1997 in Akayesu, what is your version today, Madam?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>If I recall correctly, I was speaking in that passage of accusations made in February 1993, concerning supposed massive killings of 40,000 or perhaps even 100,000 people during the RPF advance that began on February the 8th. My position on that is unchanged. We have never found any evidence whatsoever to substantiate such accusations. It is extremely important in questions of this gravity to be precise about place and date in order to assure that those responsible are brought to justice.</p>

I will have to see several pages, and I am afraid I have great difficulty reading this from the screen, but I would be surprised, since I saw the start of the next paragraph refers to tens of thousands of Tutsis killed in Butare, I wonder exactly what this passage is referring to, and I really cannot tell you on the basis of the sentences you read to me.

            <p>If you are attempting to give a sincere and honest reading to a document, you must take an entire passage into consideration and not extract a sentence or two in an attempt to make your point.

            <p>Maybe your answer concerns 1993, but that is not the point at issue. You said, "I have never - I never had any proof of massacres by the RPF", and in the same document you testified before the Tribunal -- this document was provided to me by the Prosecutor.</p>

I was asked to comment on allegations in 1993 of massive killings, and my answer refers to that event. I said: "We did not find evidence of massive killings in 1993."

All the persons here today -- the Defence team wishes to greet all of the members of the Tribunal this morning. The Defence team this morning is composed this morning by Ms. Mbattang; by myself, Counsel Kouengoua; and our assistant's name is Tharcisse Gatarama.If we are not able to complete our testimony in time, it will really be due to conditions beyond our control. We really intend to complete by 10:00. There is something that has not been answered. The Prosecutor said, this morning that he does not intend to speak after me, and I have insisted on this yesterday. I think if there is a problem with that or this matter is in question, then we can look at -- read the draft transcripts. The Court told me, "Don't make us stay here for a long time", and I said, Madam President, I will do my utmost. But if I have to stop just to allow the Prosecutor to do a re-examination of 15 or 30 minutes, quite frankly, that would not be fair, and I have insisted on this point since yesterday. I would like this point to be clarified before I begin. Please, Madam President, I request that you clarify this matter.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, his comments merit no comment because the Rules are clear: examination-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination shall be allowed in each case. So in adversarial litigation, Your Honours, re-examination follows cross-examination. In the event that counsel asked to be able to cross-examine this witness, of course, the Prosecutor is entitled to re-examine, and it would have been the other way around if it was counsel's witness and I cross-examined.

And, Madam President, we are going to verify this in the transcript. The Trial Chamber said that the Defence would speak mainly with respect to the cross-examination and this is what was said. I'm not saying that we should change the Rules. I just think that each person should respect -- abide by the promise they made to this Trial Chamber.

            <p>The chart is a schematic rendering of a more complex organisational structure done for the purpose of illustrating my testimony.

            <p>Madam, a witness to whom I asked the question told me that the hierarchical superior of the bourgmestre is the subpréfet not the préfet. How could you have neglected that, whereas, my client is a bourgmestre -- was a bourgmestre?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>I explained the purposes of the chart. The chart was done for a certain reason. In any case, the echelon of sous-préfet was, I believe, according to law, added considerably after the structure of préfecture and commune, and never had the same political weight as these other offices. It was a kind of bureaucratic half-way house, if you can say that, a stopping off point, for documents and orders that went up and down the hierarchy, but in political terms the sous-préfet had none of the importance of the préfet and the bourgmestre; for example, the structure of the security councils, the conseils de sécurité, which were very important during this period, existed at the level of préfecture and level of commune, but so far as I know, there was no such structure at the level of sous-préfecture.</p>

            <p>Article 57 -- I was saying: "The bourgmestre is under the hierarchical superior in charge of economic and social development of the commune and the application of laws and regulations. Moreover, he works in close cooperation in the accomplishment of tasks of general interest when requisitioned by the préfet." Article 50 -- and Article 58: "The bourgmestre is, in general, entrusted with implementing decisions taken by the communal council."

            <p>For example, page 47, testimony of 12th of February 1997, "He has exclusive responsibility and authority over the communal police and, through that police force, he is responsible for maintaining order. When he needs reinforcement from elsewhere, to enforce order, he can requisition the Gendarmerie Nationale and can requisition them when they were present in his commune.

            <p>There is another part to that sentence which says "when they are in his commune". I believe if you look at the law on the communes, you will see that when the national gendarmerie is put at the disposition of the bourgmestre he then assumes control over them.</p>

I do not carry all of those details in my head, but I am quite sure that there is a discussion in the book about the church of Nyarubuye. And, here, if I might add a point of clarification, I realise now that when you questioned me earlier about Rusumo, you were speaking of the commune of Rusumo. In my own mind, I think of Rusumo in a much more narrow context, and when you asked was I in Rusumo in August, I was thinking of Rusumo at the crossing point, which is the place I always think of, or the bureau communal. I was not there in August, but I was indeed at Nyarubuye in August. So in the book I don't know whether you find Rusumo, but I'm quite sure find Nyarubuye.</p>

In any case, the "poteaux électriques", I do not recall having observed them either standing or on the ground. I simply have no recollection of having seen them. I believe there was no electricity at the time I was there, so that may indicate that they had not been replaced upright.</p>

            <p>I would say that, based upon my observations, Rusumo was one of the most rural and most -- what shall I say? It gave the impression of a place that was remote from the centre, not in the heart of things. The population, as I recall, not just from 1994 but from earlier visits -- when I was doing historical research in the area, I recall it as being a very relatively lightly populated region compared to central Rwanda and one with relatively little commercial life; that is, there were not a great number of shops and crossroads and so on. My impression was, instead, of a rural, very dispersed population.</p>

            <p>It reflects the way our research was done. Our work was concentrated in the préfecture of Butare which was chosen because of its particular history of resisting the genocide, and then certain adjacent areas which we took for the purposes of comparison from the préfecture of Gikongoro and then other materials that happened to come to us from the préfecture of Kibuye. We then expanded into Gitarama because that also was an area that was slower to join in the genocide, and our research on the ground did not deal with Kibungo, with Byumba, Ruhengeri or Gisenyi; so it is not at all surprising. Our work was focused on certain geographical regions and then enlarged to include a history of the genocide at national level and its international connections, but it was not meant to be an intensive ground level study of every region of Rwanda.</p>

            <p>I put the question to you before producing the document. My question was -- because you told me that in 1994 there was an alliance between the MRND and the CDR, and I'm showing you this document to ask for your reaction. This document put an end to what you said, from 27 March 1992.</p>

            <p>No, no, no, you got it wrong. If you recall my answer, I said that these two parties worked in common from 1992 through 1994, with the exception of a period when they separated. That period was, indeed, the period of this letter. But the parties resumed their alliance sometime after that, and my answer is correct for the year 1994.</p>

            <p>I do not know that the alliance was formally recreated or renewed but, certainly, if you look at the series of CDR press releases, and I am thinking particularly of those from the month of August through to the end of 1993 and into 1994, you will see there an association with the power position which encompassed at that point, as well the MRND.</p>

But one of the characteristics of politics in Rwanda is its dynamism. People changed positions rapidly and easily, and coalitions group and regroup as the parties see their interest at the moment.</p>

            <p>As I recall, there were very few bodies in the church at that time, perhaps only a half dozen bodies or parts of bodies. I remember some just inside the main entrance. I remember some bones which appeared to be leg bones near the altar, but it was not a church that was filled with bodies, certainly not at the time I saw it. There were bodies in front of the church, or parts of bodies. I recall, when I stepped out of the truck, I looked down and realised I was standing on the body of a small child, and then as I walked back along the path into the courtyard there were groups of bodies, perhaps five, six, seven at a time lying alongside the path and, then, as you entered the courtyard, there were a very large number of bodies in the distant corner of the courtyard, as if a group of people had fled and been trapped there and killed there. I made an attempt to estimate the number. It was very difficult because the bodies were pell-mell, very much a dense mass, but my estimate would be under 1,000; in other words, not tens of thousands but under 1,000, given the space. In addition, there was a small house in the courtyard where there were bodies and then there were classrooms, as well, in which there were bodies. </p>

            <p>Now, on the basis of what you saw at the church, the chapel and the precincts and on the basis of investigations that you carried out and discussions you had with both the survivors and the witnesses, were you able to establish approximately how many people were killed at the church or within the precincts of the church? </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Estimating numbers is perhaps one of the most difficult aspects of evaluating a catastrophe. No one is very good at this. Survivors generally speak only of large numbers of people; they have no concept and, indeed, you can imagine, were you in a similar position, you also would not be interested in how many others exactly were surrounding you. So, the only reliable basis I feel was my own observation of what I saw. It's possible that a certain number of bodies had been removed. Certainly, some parts of bodies had been consumed by dogs. I would be surprised, given the area, the relative sparsely of population and so on, if there had been more than, say, 10,000 victims at that site. I know that there were a substantial number of other people who came there to seek refuge there as they fled towards the border, but the Tutsi population, the total Tutsi population of the commune at that time was, I believe, fewer than 4,000. I believe it was 3,700 and something, and certainly not all of those people were killed. So, you would have that basis, plus the people who came in from the outside. But when these attacks took place, the numbers of attackers were never equal to the numbers of victims, certainly not. And one can picture an attack -- at least here I draw on the basis of my experience elsewhere because I have not studied this in detail -- but where one would have a small number of professional armed people -- that is, soldiers or gendarmes or former soldiers or even perhaps militiamen -- but they would be in the order of one, two, three dozen, so, certainly fewer than 50. And then you would have a mass of ordinary people who had been summoned, who had arms like machetes and clubs and so on, and they would perhaps have been, at most, in the neighbourhood of a thousand or perhaps something more than a thousand. That would mean that when the attack happened, some people got away. And, indeed, from the accounts of witnesses, people did get away. So if you have 10,000 or more at any given time at the church, once the attack begins, people do flee. So, that would leave me to estimate 10,000 or fewer, perhaps considerably fewer, since my own observation was, I would say, fewer than a thousand.</p>

            <p>Based on witness statements, it would seem that the attacks were on the 15th. There may have been preliminary skirmishes earlier and follow-ups later, but I believe the 15th was the day. That was also the day of major attacks in Kibungo, the préfectural capital, and then the RPF arrived approximately the 27th or 28th in that area. So that would be the point after which further killings of Tutsi would have diminished rapidly. They would not have ended altogether, but would have diminished rapidly because most of the other militia and others would have fled.</p>

            <p>Madam Witness, unfortunately, very many people were killed in churches. Could you briefly comment on this phenomenon? What was the role of religion in Rwandan society and what were the relationships between the religion and state authorities by the end of -- the middle of the '90s? Thank you. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>The first question, why there were massacres in the churches, is relatively simple to answer. As Judge Reddy mentioned, there had been prior massacres in Rwanda. When Tutsi had been threatened previously and had fled to churches or even to secular places like communal offices or schools, they had been safe. So that those who felt threatened saw the church as a place of refuge, whether they were members of that church or not, simply a church was a safe place, as was a hospital, a communal office, a school. It was clear very early on, I believe it was Saturday morning, the 9th, when the first church massacre occurred at Gikondo church in Kigali. So it was clear very early on that the church in fact this time was not going to be a sanctuary, a place of safety that would be honoured. But people who were attacked had so few choices, so few options, that many chose to go to a church even if they had heard of massacres in churches elsewhere. In some cases, administrative officials encouraged or even ordered people to go to churches. In some cases, they did that in order to keep people from congregating at communal offices, but in other instances they actually went to the homes of Tutsi and told them to go to the church. Because this appears clearly established at least in some areas, it appears that this was, in fact, a decision to use the impulse of people to flee to churches as a way to better kill them, to target them more efficiently. The question of relationship between the church and the state is obviously more complex. The most important church in Rwanda is the Catholic church. The great majority of Christians are Catholic rather than Protestant. The early Catholic missionaries who had come from Europe after 1900, in the twentieth century, were often close collaborators with the colonial administration and a source of information for the colonial administrators, who believed the missionaries were the real experts because particularly the Catholics would come and spend their entire lives there. Because of this the Catholic church or certain of the important Catholic clergy had a very large influence on colonial policy. Although the church was never as homogeneous, as uniform, as people depicted because there were always other currents, for example, there were always some priests who supported Hutu rather than Tutsi, but the church hierarchy -- once Tutsi had converted to Christianity, the church hierarchy supported the idea of a Tutsi monopoly of power; in many instances, anyway. Then, in the 1950s there was the arrival of a new generation of missionary workers after the Second World War. They were part of a more radical Catholic movement -- for example, the movement of worker priests -- and they were more concerned about a democracy and sharing political power. Notably, a Swiss bishop named Perraudin was typical of that group. They encouraged the development of political ideas among the Hutu. So, you had a change in church policy that corresponded to and perhaps even encouraged the change in administrative policy in the 1950s as the switch was made from backing Tutsi power to encouraging Tutsi to organize. By the time of the genocide, the church, the clergy, was largely Rwandan -- the number of foreign missionaries was relatively small -- but this clergy was itself divided between Tutsi and Hutu. And perhaps 60 per cent -- it's difficult to know for sure, but perhaps 60 per cent of the clergy, the Catholic clergy at that time was Tutsi. But the hierarchy was generally Hutu because the Catholic church is very adaptable to political circumstances; it was a Hutu government; the hierarchy was Hutu, to such an extent that the archbishop was for a number of years a member of the central committee of the MRND until the church finally forced him to resign that post. But even when he was no longer a part of the party structure, he continued to be very close to President Habyarimana and to his wife. President Habyarimana made a great deal of his Catholicism and it was an important bond for him, particularly with President Mitterrand of France. So, the situation was very complex by the time the genocide was begun and you have cases where obviously Tutsi priests were killed with their congregation, with the people in their church. You have cases where Hutu clergy defended Tutsi who were attacked, but you also have cases where Hutu clergy at some level were complicit in the genocide, perhaps only, for example, by continuing the practice of announcing from the pulpit on Sunday that there would be a meeting on such-and-such a day and thereby letting it be known that they were aware of the meeting, they probably knew what would be discussed at the meeting and yet they helped to publicise the meeting; all the way from that level or the level of simply saying nothing, to the level of actual involvement in attacks. So, it was very complicated, but the impulse to go to the church to seek safety in the church was a much more simple and straightforward kind of reaction. </p>

            <p>Madam, before giving the floor to the Prosecution I should also like to ask you one or two questions. You spoke of corpses floating in the Akagera River when you arrived there. If possible, I should like to know whether you were able to obtain information as to the approximate date of those killings and also the number of victims that were found in the river. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, the Akagera River moves rather rapidly in the area of the falls, less rapidly upstream, but I believe it would take no more than four or five days for a body to make its way down river past the point where I was, even assuming it were thrown in the water considerably upstream. That would mean that the bodies which I saw and which were seen by many journalists as late as August would have been thrown in the river probably no more than a week or two before, assuming -- depending on the distance from the point of observation. That would mean that they would have been relatively recent victims.The observers of the UNHCR who watched the river from the Tanzanian side noted a decline in the number of bodies passing after the end of April; in other words, the peak of the great numbers of bodies going by was in the last two weeks of April and perhaps the first week in May. And then there was a period of relatively few bodies. And then there was an increase subsequently, and the date that I recall was May 17, although it may have been somewhat earlier in May, when UNHCR people reported a new wave of bodies and they noted that a number of these bodies had their arms tied behind them. It would appear that the first and far larger number of bodies represented victims of genocide who were thrown in the river and that the second group represented victims of the RPF, with a distinction in time there of one to two weeks, which would correspond to the time when the RPF arrived and drove away the genocidal killers, and then the period when the victims of the RPF also appeared in the water. The total number of victims that went down the river or up the river to Lake Victoria was in the order of tens of thousands. No one knows really how many but certainly tens of thousands, perhaps a hundred thousand, but that would surprise me. I would say more likely tens of thousands of bodies. </p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, madam. My second question is the following: The description you gave us in 1997 of the role and powers of the bourgmestre in 1994 in the Akayesu case, is it applicable to all other communes or do you think that there were differences, variations from one commune to the other? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, there certainly were differences from one commune to the other, with many variables determining that difference. In some cases, even within a single party -- for example, the MRND -- there would have been differences in the standing, in the power, the authority, of a given bourgmestre. The kinds of considerations which would determine this would be, for example, the length of time he had been in power, the extent of the organisation of opposition political parties, whether or not there were significant other contenders as rivals to a bourgmestre, the efficiency of the communal police, the extent of the political organisation of the party to which the bourgmestre belonged. If he were a MRND party member himself, was there a sufficient backup structure for him at that time or had the MRND power been eroded by the development of other political parties? It would depend also on his relations upward as well as his relations downward. What was his relationship to the prefect, to the minister of interior and, eventually, possibly to President Habyarimana. There were some bourgmestres who were very close to Habyarimana. Obviously, they had considerably more power than those who were more remote. Had they family connections in the region? If they were representatives of a large lineage group and had many relatives who backed them, this also was a determinant in terms of their power. So, I'm sorry, I cannot provide you with a more precise answer except to say, yes, there were considerable variations in the effective power; not in the legal authority because the legal authority was the same from commune to commune; but the effective power varied considerably according to local circumstances. In general, the bourgmestre had the possibility, for example, to distribute resources, particularly land, and in the context of the genocide this becomes a very important issue, as it had been in the 1960s as well. I mentioned yesterday how bourgmestres would use the opportunity of vacant lands to increase their power. And in some places we find very early on the bourgmestre and communal authorities organising the listing and even the distribution of property from Tutsi as a way to increase their power and to mobilise greater numbers to participate in the genocide. So, that kind of resource is an important thing to look at. There are some bourgmestres who obviously were personally unenthusiastic, if not actually opposed, to killing Tutsi but who, in the end, participated because of the combination of pressures upon them. I know the history best of areas in the centre and the south of the country where that happened, but I cannot exclude that that was also the case perhaps in this case. The end result, of course, for the victims was the same. If the local authority, for whatever reason, becomes a participant in genocide, then the victims have relatively little chance of escaping. </p>

            <p>The hearing resumes.We were in closed session, but we will go into open session for our decision to be read.The Defence requested an adjournment until December 2003, to begin presenting the case for the Defence. It is because of problems for preparations, the few missions undertaken, difficulties in locating witnesses, and the lack of time in general terms. It stated inter-alia that witnesses who have been contacted wanted to speak with counsel before agreeing to testify, and the witnesses were hard to locate.The Chamber notes that a calendar was already -- had been established after a meeting held in the presence of all interested parties on the 10th of July 2003, Judge Møse, presiding. The calendar has been communicated to the parties, and no comments had been made as to the dates proposed.Specifically, the Defence did not object to the date proposed to begin presenting its evidence in the case for the Defence. Counsel was appointed in October 2001. He recently declared, in the course of the hearing, that his investigators had met since then, approximately 200 potential witnesses.It appears, therefore, to the Trial Chamber, that Defence has had sufficient time and resources to prepare its case and to draw up a list of witnesses to testify for Defence as of 6th October 2003.The Trial Chamber takes note of the difficulties indicated by the Defence, but considers they are not of a nature that justifies adjournment of the trial. The Trial Chamber notes, moreover, that the Tribunal's calendar which has already been established for all the Trial Chambers until December 2003, does not allow adjournment and postponement -- the postponement until December 2003.To help the Defence in its preparation, the Trial Chamber requests the witness and victims section to provide as much assistance as necessary to the Defence, to ensure the appearance of the witnesses for the Defence.The Defence shall as soon as possible, provide to the WVSS, all the information concerning the witnesses, including the expert witnesses. The Defence will have to comply with Rule 73Ter., and inter-alia, file its Defence brief -- preliminary Defence brief, before Friday, 3rd of October 2003 at the latest. The trial will recommence on 6th October 2003 as planned, with the preliminary Defence statement, and then testimony by the Accused if he wishes to appear in his own defence. We will continue with the testimony of expert witnesses and those Defence witnesses present.For the aforegoing reasons, the Trial Chamber denies the Defence application to postpone the date for commencement of the presentation of the case for the Defence.That is it. We thank you, and we now adjourn.Counsel Kouengoua, you can come and see us if you have any problems.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, Your Lordships, in June 2001 the Prosecutor fabricated and submitted to this Tribunal an indictment against Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, who stands accused before you today. That indictment, vague and imprecise, comprises five counts: genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity <stage>(extermination),</stage> crimes against humanity <stage>(killing)</stage> and crimes against humanity <stage>(rape).</stage> Those five counts were described in an incomprehensible amalgamation, where rumour and reality are interwoven as well as journalistic or police-type imagination. That whole indictment is the reason for which Gacumbitsi is imprisoned under the false pretext that he would have planned or executed the genocide, exterminated, killed or incited people to kill, incited the population or part of the population of which he was the bourgmestre. </p>
          </sp>
          
          <stage>(Before the very real difficulties faced by the defendant in understanding why he has been deprived of his liberty, he sought the Trial Chamber for the indictment against him to be amended so that he should know the dates and the places where the crimes he has been gratuitously accused of were committed by him in destroying his own population -- allegedly destroying his own population. In June 2002 the Prosecution, while recognising the lack of precision in the indictment, had stated that it was current practice and that the Tribunal would have the opportunity to choose between the offences proposed, and that in any case the Accused couldn't be accused of two self-cancelling crimes. In the concise statement of the facts relative to counts 1 and 2 of the indictment, the Prosecutor stated that between the 1st of January and the 31st of December 1994, Rwandan citizens were individually identified according to the following ethnic or racial classification, Tutsi, Hutu or Twa, whereas the expert witness, Alison Des Forges, said that that classification dated from the '30s.In the same indictment we are told that between the 1st of January and the 31st of December 1994 there took place in Rwanda armed conflict of a non-international character, whereas it is notorious and acknowledged that after the 1st of October 1990, parts of the Ugandan national army attacked and occupied part of Rwandan national territory.In the indictment mention is made of the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana as a natural death, whereas it is notorious that he was assassinated along with other public figures.The same indictment has said the Accused, in his capacity as a militant of the MRND party and his status as bourgmestre, had authority over the gendarmes and the civil militia in Rusumo commune, whereas there never were any gendarmes in Rusumo, much less any militia. Madam President, Your Lordships, the lack of precision by the Prosecutor in his indictment is not fortuitous, it is due to the fact that the latter, instead of investigating, finding the evidence that might guide the Prosecution, has preferred, and I quote -- has preferred journalism. And we were shown a video cassette here by Fergal Keane. How can it be that having all the necessary financial and human resources at their disposal, they could not better pin down the evidence concerning the person accused? The Prosecution, instead of pursuing a serious case, has preferred to (not interpreted) someone who cannot be convicted of what he has been accused. Thus we heard the vague statement of Witness TAP, who came to reveal for the first time before the Trial Chamber on the 6th of August 2003 the grave and the very serious acts that the Prosecutor had not had the chance to hear before.The witness, violating Rules of Procedure, wanted us to believe things that were never stated during the preliminary investigation and were not in the indictment.Similarly for Witness TBH, who, having killed and having been convicted for 15 years prison, came to boast of his crimes. Witnesses such as TBK and TBI, although they also acknowledged having killed, looted and committed arson, were however not prosecuted. This temerity on the part of the Prosecution could only lead to accuse the defendant, who is a man who described the commune as a vast abandoned plantation. How could someone who didn't have a telephone communicate with the central authorities? Juridically, what is the motive for the crimes of which Gacumbitsi Sylvestre is accused? And, if there is no motive, who could profit from the crimes which Gacumbitsi allegedly committed?People from central government allegedly came to Rusumo to plan the killing during or before April 1994. Why not have listened to the Prosecution witnesses, who did say that the disorder that occurred in Rusumo was caused by assailants who had come from elsewhere?If, as most of the Prosecution witnesses claim, that everything was calm before the 13th of April, it is because the defendant used all his powers to preserve order in his commune. But he is not accused of having violated the rules of any monarchy or any republic, he is appearing before an international tribunal entrusted with enforcing international humanitarian law. Madam President, Your Honours, at this stage we should know where we stand exactly, because to condemn or convict a man who is innocent would be a violation precisely of international human rights. There was a journalist who was brought here who does not investigate, does not look for evidence, but who was told by soldiers of the RPF who is supposed to have been the cause of the death of the corpses he sees before him. This journalist, sent to Rwanda by the BBC, was guided by Lieutenant Frank of the RPF. This is who we saw in the video. Frank Dolay (phonetic), he is the man we saw on the video that was shown to us on the 28th and 29th of July last. And that is how the journalist filmed the corpses shown to him by the RPF.How did the journalists, all these journalists, including Fergal Keane, wind up at the Benaco camp in Tanzania? How can a journalist, who did not have the opportunity to discuss with the inhabitants of the commune, know the names and the places of the bourgmestre in exile?The thesis we are developing here is not a creation of the Defence, because in 1992 the RPF, at the time of the preparation of the Arusha Accord, had asked for Sylvestre Gacumbitsi to be replaced as bourgmestre of Rusumo commune, as emerges from the report of the National Evaluation Commission dated 3rd May 1993, page 55, paragraph 4, where it is written the following: "The steps taken to replace the bourgmestre might be inspired by strategic considerations. The commission finds nothing that would cause his departure". In spite of those contradictions, the Prosecutor on the 28th of July 2003 before your august Bench defended a thesis that he had known to have been patched together. That is how they thought they could modify the indictment, by stating in the preliminary opening statement that the police and traditional authorities had been killed or had fled, and the net result of that destruction was that they were not able to undertake the necessary technical investigations that are often conducted in a routine fashion by national jurisdictions in times of peace. Nonetheless, the Prosecutor was convinced that he was able to gather on the ashes of that conflict evidence, credible evidence that he will present to you in order to prove his case beyond any reasonable doubt. Now, in that respect, it has escaped the Prosecutor that it is the old saying that it is better to have a thousand assassins at large than one innocent person in prison. Your Honours, to sustain the accusation of genocide, complicity, extermination, murder and rape against Gacumbitsi is an impossible mission, much as the myth of Sisyphus.To date, Gacumbitsi -- I quote the Prosecutor on the 20th: "Gacumbitsi is not an ordinary criminal, he is a good paterfamilias, and it is said that he lived in relative harmony with his neighbours with whom he was in the habit of having a drink or exchanging cows. His distinctive trait is the zeal and rage with which he dealt with his Tutsi victims in executing the genocide". No, Your Honours, our client cannot be both one and the other at the same time, if it is said that he was a good paterfamilias. When he was born in 1943 it was a poor family in which he was born. His father died in 1953 and his mother, who was a peasant farmer, managed to feed and raise five orphans. He began primary school very near his home, but went on to follow the elder children to further his primary studies at Nyarubuye, which is about 30 kilometres from his home.At the end of the fifth year of primary schooling in 1957 he passed a national exam with 86 per cent, which then made it possible for him to go into the sixth year at Rwaza, and the priest and the director of primary studies spoke to his mother in order to encourage him to go on with his studies. If he was to look for the people who helped him today, he would return to Nyarubuye and the priests who worked there, because otherwise he never would have continued his schooling to the level which he achieved. In 1958 he took another exam to enter the teacher training school at Byumba where, in 1963, he obtained his teacher's diploma, and in October 1963 he started teaching at Kirehe school. In 1970-71 he went on a pedagogic course in Butare. He was a teaching inspector, and then in 1975 he was president of the people's bank in Rusumo. And then, to his great surprise, he was given the task of bourgmestre of one of the poorest communes in Rwanda, where he undertook to finish the work of his predecesor who had died. By turning his sister (sic) with Mayence Bingen in Germany, faced with the lack of school structure, he participated in the creation of two private secondary schools. He initiated projects for water piping in the commune. In 1994 he resigned from his position as president of the people's bank to better serve his commune. He built health centres, offices, tribunals, et cetera. This very religious man will never say he is the best. Gacumbitsi Sylvestre was the type of bourgmestre that the communes in Rwanda dreamed about and other nations seek today. He was a mayor who for 11 years never thought of giving himself a car or accumulating property. One of the first acts of the young mayor was to install Tutsis who came from Uganda in 1982 in his commune in 1983. The only business he undertook was a brick factory with a Tutsi associate, Bitegeko Enfant. His friend, his childhood friend and chauffeur was also a Tutsi. The people who rented from him were also Tutsi, but to better blacken the name of this generous man, it has been claimed that he killed his best friend who was also a Tutsi.Honourable Judges, with my team here we are defending a married man with six children whose only fault today is having been honest, generous, of service, and having devoted his time and his love to serving others.Yesterday, as today, he had to leave his family and his goods and flee to Tanzania because his first crime was to have arrested evildoers and lock them in a communal jail on the 11th of April 1994. His second error or fault was to have a physical appearance that makes him look like a Tutsi or belonging to the Tutsi ethnic group, and that appearance led to him being accused of being an accomplice and was threatened with death. The Prosecution, in speaking of murder in its opening statement, does not make it possible to recognise the count in the indictment which is of killing. The words used by the Prosecution are those used by Patrick Fergal Keane, the journalist in his book 'Season of Blood'. And all the witnesses produced by the Prosecution, apart from envious people such as his childhood friends, who dreamed instead of studying to become civil servants and bourgmestres, became jealous. And all those pseudo-witnesses refused to tell the Chamber what was the ethnic group of Madam Gacumbitsi, whereas they claimed that they were intimate friends of the family. Simeoné, Rugegema, Kanyagote and their children have been cited as victims of the killing, whereas none of those names appear in the indictment which is the only basis for prosecution. Gacumbitsi does not know whether today he is defending himself on the basis of the indictment or on the basis of the new allegations made during the hearings. I do not think that for those pseudo-witnesses who claimed to recognise the defendant at the hearing, when the Accused is the only person in the Trial Chamber to have one or two guards sitting next to him. The witnesses that come here know beforehand where the Accused -- where the defendant is sitting. Madam President, Your Lordships, in spite of the incessant movement of witnesses that we have contacted and the intimidation to which many have bowed, Gacumbitsi's Defence intends to produce before you men and women from Rwanda, Hutu and Tutsi, living there or elsewhere in the world who, by knowing this bourgmestre, this man with a heart who loved his country and his commune in particular, will come and tell us what happened in April 1994. They will show you that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was and will be one of the best mayors, one of the best bourgmestres, beyond irrational considerations belonging to socio-political religious considerations. They will come to testify that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi did not participate in any killing, that he did not give any order for anyone to kill someone. Moreover, he never incited anyone to loot, to burn or to rape. This information will allow the Trial Chamber -- and we are convinced of this -- to say that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is not a jurisdiction for those who have won against those who have lost, but it is universal justice, and these men and women will allow the Trial Chamber to say before the whole world that if it is true that a rotten tooth will make the whole mouth smell, it is also true that only the rotten tooth should be extracted, and that the time when we should judge things as dealing with the wolf and the lamb, this is no longer the case, because he did not commit any fault.The Defence intends to produce a document that will establish, that will show that the bodies produced by the Prosecutor in the video in the hearing on the 28th and 29th of July 2003 were not the result of things done by the Accused, but rather this was a scene that was produced by the RPF and filmed by the producer and editor, the journalist Patrick Fergal Keane, who received prizes in 1994 and 1995 on the pain and suffering of Rwandans.Madam President, Your Honours, what the witnesses will come to tell you will confirm what you already know about Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, and that Alison Des Forges summarised as follows on the 27th of August 2003: "I never heard Gacumbitsi's name being mentioned as a member of the Akazu, and I would be surprised if he were a member of the Akazu". Madam President, Your Honours, at the end of this long opening statement, but it was necessary for it to be long, the Trial Chamber will see that the innocence of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and will shine throughout the world.I wish to thank you for your attention, Madam President, Your Honours.)</stage>

            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, before we go into the heart of the subject, there are two motions that I would like to file. The first motion that I would like to present -- sorry, is there a technical problem again? As I was saying, Madam President, I was saying that the Defence had two motions they wished to present. The first motion, of course, deals with the documents that the Defence has disclosed, and more specifically, I am referring to the witness statements made by Defence witnesses. In view of the lack of time available to us, and in view of the fact that we wish to respect the deadlines, there are many mistakes that appear in these statements and we cannot correct them in time, and when it comes to today's hearing I thought it best to mention them before so that everyone could be aware of this. For example, if you look at the date of the witness statement of the witness that is going to appear now, if we look at the document that you received, it says the 23rd of April 2003 for the date of the statement. That is not possible, because I was telling you on that date that the investigator was still on mission. </p>

The Defence wishes, pursuant to the order issued by the Trial Chamber with respect to witness protection, that the Defence witness appearing today should testify in closed session, that all of his testimony should be made in closed session.I respectfully submit that if I had to explain the reasons I should do so, but in two stages.

They would put certain instruments that had been heated on the child to try and resolve the illness. This was the case for me, for Gacumbitsi and for many others.

            <p>The people that Gacumbitsi administered had a good relationship with him.

Even the people before he came to post had also hoped, had always aspired for him to be a high-ranking official and this was because they had noticed his good behaviour.

News of the incident spread, and then commune authorities became aware of this. Later, Gacumbitsi arrested the persons who were responsible for the attack, and they were imprisoned at their communal prison. And in the meantime, there were troubles caused by others who said they were defending the Tutsis, protecting the Tutsi.

Someone who inspires fear in people cause other reactions. The fact that he was considered as a parent perhaps explains that he was someone who was gifted and who was kind.</p>

The witness was asked whether in his experience, in his experience he would consider it unusual for a jail to be unguarded. It's perfectly proper for this question to be put.</p>

            <p>Normally, to my knowledge, a jail -- and I know what I'm talking about -- a jail is not strictly guarded. At times you can find detainees outside speaking with police officers and, at an appointed time, the detainees are led back into the cell.

We should not harass the people who come to tell the truth and mislead them into saying things that they don't want to say, or which we are not in a position to say.

So, if the Prosecutor needs further clarification she should proceed from thereon. The witness did say that the -- you would see detainees discussing with police guards outside the prison premises and later on going back into their cells.

            <p>Witness, I'm going to repeat the question. Why didn't you report to the responsable in your cellule that your friend, Kanyagote, who you said was your neighbour, was killed, indeed, murdered in another cellule? What was your reason?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zez">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZEZ:</speaker>
            <p>The event took place in Kavuzo cellule and many of the persons who lived in this cellule were witnesses to these events. There were enough of these persons that one of them would have gone to talk about the events. I felt that as I came from another cellule I did not have any responsibility in doing so, and there was no reason for me to go and repeat those events. And I told you that I was sad, and I did not have the courage to go close to the body, especially as I knew there was nothing I could do for him. It was too late.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-zez">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZEZ:</speaker>
            <p>That wasn't possible at the time because his family was no longer alive because of the killings, people were dying en masse and authorities at the time were useless, they were pointless. There was no point in going to tell them about a murder. And often, we would go back to our own houses because we feared for our own lives because of all of the violence that reigned.</p>

            <p>No, that's not done anywhere because an authority cannot interfere in events taking place in another region in another administrative entity. The responsables deal with matters, events that took place under their jurisdiction. This is the way. This is common practice.</p>

            <p>No, I was never a witness of that. I never heard that. I know that on several occasions he tried to stop the acts, but at some point this insecurity increased. And with the advent of the multiparty system, I told you that people who were in positions of authority were often ignored or treated with disdain. And I remember that some persons felt disdain towards him. There were criminals, for example, who were members of the MDR party. We were in Rwanteru and we were able to see that these persons felt a great deal of disdain towards him. And we noticed that they did not bother him. At one point, he was even given responsibility for another party -- or, rather, he was actually made to wear a hat of another party. </p>

I have spoken to you of the events that took place at Nyamugali, and I have spoken to you about events dealing with the persons who had -- the persons he had taken in. I would add that these persons, Kanyagote, Rugisha's wife, when these persons were killed, they were on their way trying to seek refuge at Gacumbitsi's house. Therefore, I say that if Gacumbitsi had been a well-known killer, people would not have attempted to go and seek refuge at this house if this were the case. And this is what I believe. And other allegations were made that he did not like one specific ethnic group. Actually, I noticed that he had many friends amongst this ethnicity, and actually he seemed to prefer those persons. I know people who did not like him because of this.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, maybe before we adjourn, I just wish to draw the Chamber's attention to matters that merit consideration by Your Lordships, maybe over night, and they are interrelated and relate to the progress of this trial and judicial economy.The first, Your Honours, is that it appears the Defence is relying on the evidence of a good character of the Accused. We submit, Your Honours, that the evidence of the good character of the accused prior to the crimes with which he is charged is irrelevant in this kind of prosecution.The second, Your Honours, is the Defence of tu quo que in which the Defence seeks to, as it were, justify the killings by saying that the RPF committed killings.I cite, Your Honours, the decision in the Prosecutor against Kupreskic and others, decision of the good character of the accused and the defence of tu quo que. This is an ICTY decision dated 17th of February 1999. This decision, Your Honours, suggests that one; evidence of the good character of the accused is irrelevant in prosecutions such as these. And secondly, that the defence of tu quo que is not a defence.Now, I am not asking for a decision at this point, Your Honours, but I am raising it so that Your Honours may deliberate upon it and see if there is any way to reduce on the time wasted by leading defences that are irrelevant and inadmissible.You will see from the decision I have cited, the Defence in Kupreskic was only allowed one character witness. Now, if the other 24 witnesses are going to come and testily about the good character of the accused, and about the atrocities committed by the RPF, we will waste a lot of time and we will not be able to conclude this defence case within the time that has been set aside.I am most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, it is my duty to respond to the concerns raised by the Prosecutor, and I must admit that I am surprised and I have always said this. Madam President, if the Defence wishes to assist the Tribunal in rendering justice, then they must do so -- if the Prosecutor wishes to do so, then they must do so in good time. It is 5:00 p.m., we have decided to adjourn -- it is 5:05; the Prosecutor has not filed a motion, he has not raised an objection, and if he wishes to file a motion then he should do so. But as the Defence has done everything, since the 28th of July, to respect the deadlines and to refrain from wasting time, that we should raise this at this stage, Madam President, I believe that on the contrary, we are to stop raising the issue of time, and this has been refused to me on two occasions, and I will never return to this. Madam President, you said that we would sit from the 6th of October to the 31st October. I have said again and again that we would like everything to be completed as far as the Defence case is concerned, but I do not believe that people should seek to give us lessons that we do not deserve. If the Prosecutor wishes to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to some matters, he should do so, but he cannot just stand up and make speeches as if we were all apprentices. This is not proper behaviour. You cannot render a decision if no motion is filed before you.I would like you to thank your for your attention to this matter.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President, your Lordships, Counsel for the Prosecution, the registry, ladies and gentlemen, the interpreters and the stenographers, court stenographers. At the outset I should like to impart some information to the Trial Chamber. Whilst I remain somewhat anxious, because as a man of law, coincidence, of course, has no place in what we do. Yesterday in beginning presentation of my Defence case, we were let down by the electronics. Technical, scientific faults are not a problem, but it's when I'm beginning it's a problem; and then we changed Trial Chambers, and then I was informed at 2:15 p.m. that among my nine ministers -- witnesses, seven who were supposed to come today, everything had been organised, three or four of them have disappeared in a refugee camp. Madam President, on hearing that, I thought of the limited number of witnesses that was proposed <stage>(sic)</stage> to me, so I thought we'd make the best of a bad job, but then, at night, I was told that the witness who was supposed to appear this morning at nine o'clock has gone to hospital, ZHZ, Witness ZHZ. I thought that she had an attack of malaria, but the protection section, WVSS section, brought me a medical document, medical certificate -- I am holding in my hand, Madam -- they just brought me. So the order of the witnesses that I had given you can no longer be respected. And this morning I asked the WVSS section whether instead of ZHZ we could bring in someone else to replace him so as not to interrupt or delay the course of justice. That was the information I had to submit to you, Madam President.So in all logic, the calendar that I filed on Friday has, contrary to my intentions, been upset.</p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Well, thank you Counsel, but I think these are simple coincidences, I don't think it was the Defence case that was being targeted. It often happens that witnesses fall ill, and as to what happened yesterday with the technical equipment, that also can happen, especially as we were informed that something happened over the weekend where the equipment had been interfered with or -- and that is why we had those problems yesterday. It's not your fault, and if I can at all reassure you, believe me, these are the hazards of life. Now, the witness that was supposed to appear after ZHZ is UHT; is he here? Is the witness present? </p>

Madam President asked you to answer the questions slowly, because the pace at which -- at the pace at which you are going the interpreters and the stenographers cannot follow you.</p>

            <p>After seeing those children, we stayed in the area for a long time. As a matter of fact, we were looking for a strategy to get out of that area, and at one time we sight -- we saw the communal vehicle coming and we were curious to note that it was a van. And when it arrived on the scene, people came out of it and I could see communal police officers in uniform. The other people I could see were three people in civilian clothes and a driver. Those were the people who alighted from the vehicle.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-uht">
            <speaker>WITNESS UHT:</speaker>
            <p>I could identify among those civilians the driver of the communal vehicle. As for the others, I realised that I didn't know them.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-uht">
            <speaker>WITNESS UHT:</speaker>
            <p>I don't know. It is possible that they were killed after we left or maybe they found a place where they took them. I don't know what their fate was. But I would like to point out that there was the child of a certain Adeline <stage>(phonetic)</stage> from Mulindi; he was Tutsi. At one time I saw this child in Gaserabake's <stage>(phonetic)</stage> home. I did not know that child, but I noticed that he resembled his parents, because I knew what his parents looked like. This child had survived. I don't know whether there were other children with them -- with him who survived as well.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS UHT:</speaker>

            <speaker>WITNESS UHT:</speaker>
            <p>Not at all. Those three people were all weighing less than 60 kilograms. So anyone who knows the height of our bourgmestre, even without close observation, he would have noticed that he wasn't among them.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS UHT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, it was being said that the bourgmestre could be on board the vehicle, and since I was a detainee, I wanted to get close to it to find out whether it was possible for me to present my situation to him.

He was very afraid, but I managed to take him back to my home and he subsequently fled. I later on saw him in Tanzania in a refugee camp, notably in the Buliki camp.

          <sp who="#witness-uht">

            <p>My response is that the Defence investigator, hired by Counsel Kouengoua, interviewed a witness. Counsel Kouengoua disclosed the statement. It has been guiding us in these proceedings, and as the adverse party, I'm entitled to establish whether what is stated in this statement is what this witness told the investigator, even though it's not signed. I acknowledge it wasn't signed, but I'm entitled to find out whether what the investigator took down is what this witness told him. And as for, you know, counsel being the -- this witness belonging to counsel, he was leading him in-chief, and it's inappropriate for counsel to lead his witness on the basis of the statement, but for the adverse party, it is within my remit. </p>

            <p>Madam President, the matter here is not whether or not the witness made statements to an investigator hired by me or not. The issue here is, the Prosecutor stated this morning that these unsigned statements cannot be used if the witness is present, and the Trial Chamber acceded to his view. The Prosecutor cannot come a few moments later to say that the version he have -- unless the version he has was signed. If he has questions to ask, he should put them to the witness. What is the purpose of the investigator? He should put the question directly to the witness. An unsigned statement, based on the theory that he formulated against the Defence, that he should stand by his position. I do not see how he can now ask to reverse this position. And Madam President, I do not believe that when the Prosecutor makes up that hypothesis, that an unsigned statement cannot be used as long as the witness is present, I can -- this -- I don't see how this would apply to a Defence statement. This should be a general principle that the law must either accept or reject. Initially it was accepted.</p>

If you know the place, is there a road going to Nyabitare? Even the road to Kiyondo cannot be used any more. No vehicle can take that road nowadays. </p>

            <p>Madam President, your Lordships, I do not want to return to Rwanda for one precise reason. Before, under the government of the time, the events that took place under their authority I did not like, but those who came to power, took power, have disappointed us. We thought that they would correct the injustices committed. But what did I see? I witnessed horrible acts. Many people were killed at Nyarubuye. But at Kamarashavu, near Mulindi, I saw more. Many people were killed atrociously. Where we were, people were killed without any investigation as to why they were killed. And following those events and in view of the fact that the present government did not do anything to correct the situation, I cannot go back to Rwanda because I am the age I am. I know what's going on. I cannot go back to my country. It's my home country. I grew up there; I studied there; I got married there. But if things would change there, I would go home immediately, but that not being the case, I do not want to return to Rwanda. </p>

            <p>I'm only interested in your opinion. So in April 1994, did you see Mr. Gacumbitsi, former bourgmestre, or anybody else from the communal administration, trying to stop massacres and to restore law and order in the place where you lived? </p>

            <p>Our bourgmestre on several occasions tried to teach us to live in harmony, in peace and harmony. He at no moment asked people to sow dissension. He did not convene -- he convened several meetings, and at none of those meetings did I hear him call on people to kill one another. I have nothing to say with regard to the other communal authorities. What I'm trying to do is to defend our bourgmestre. If you know the perpetrators of the massacres you can bring them to justice, but as regards our official, he is innocent. </p>

            <p>Madam President, on the 6th of October -- rather, the 2nd of October at the pre-Defence conference I had indicated what was -- were our preferences, what we thought as to the defence and the speed of proceedings. And if you remember correctly, the Trial Chamber told me that my programme was too ambitious, but now I see it has been totally thwarted. We should have heard three witnesses today, and now I can't. I very respectfully request the Trial Chamber to allow me to see if the remaining witness can be heard tomorrow morning, not this afternoon, because I hadn't -- I did not give the necessary instructions. I was taken by surprise. The three witnesses I thought would be here today, there is the one that is ill and two we've heard this morning. And the one we've heard now wasn't supposed to come at this time, so I had to try and patch something together. If the Trial Chamber does not object, I should like the witness who is able to testify, should testify tomorrow morning. And then if the one who is ill is better, we might hear both before tomorrow afternoon. That is the commitment I'm prepared to make, madam. And I respectfully draw the attention of the Bench to the fact that the events that have occurred do not make our task any easier. We certainly had not expected it. Psychologically, we were not prepared to face all these difficulties. Our timing was up to the 31st of October. And this is not a creation, fabricated. It's because these events occurred so rapidly that we were taken aback. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam. In the present state of affairs, I cannot say whether they will come or not. The correspondence I received from WVSS is that the search is under way. They want to try and find them. What I must tell the Trial Chamber, the air tickets, everything necessary for them to come was done. The people that were supposed to escort them went all the way where they were supposed to be, and let me tell you in all certainty, Madam, I would not like there to be any hiatus in the production of our evidence, and that is why if I knew immediately if they would be coming or not, I would find other people to replace them so that there should not be any hiatus. I personally don't want there to be any hiatus. I have no interest in having the proceedings interrupted. I don't see -- in any case, an interruption would not be in the interest of the client I am defending. So the present state of affairs I have no precise information, but when we adjourn, I shall go to WVSS and try to obtain the information available, and any information I receive I will forthwith communicate to the Bench and to the Prosecution, and I will ask WVSS if they can bring other witnesses who are supposed to appear later, so that there is no hiatus in the submission of the Defence case. That is what I can tell the August Bench. Thank you, Madam President.</p>

We will grant you the adjournment until tomorrow for the two witnesses remaining for this week, but we should, nonetheless, like to have witnesses for next week, and we therefore hope that you will take all necessary measures, along with WVSS, so that your witnesses be here before the end of the week, so that we can continue with the submission of the Defence case. As you know, after the 31st of October it will be extremely difficult to sit on this matter because all the Judges are busy elsewhere on other matters, on other cases, and we could only plan a further session for March or something like that. So, you see that it is primordial, indispensable, that you do everything possible, all that you can, so that there be no hiatus in the calling of witnesses.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours. During yesterday's hearing, the hearing of 7th October 2002, the Defence of Mr. Gacumbitsi informed the Trial Chamber that some witnesses, Defence witnesses, had disappeared. The Witnesses and Support Section would like to request that the word "disappeared" be modified and use more specifically that these people have been repatriated on a voluntary basis. Based on the list of witnesses that Mr. Gacumbitsi gave to our section on the 9th of September 2003 the registry of this Tribunal officially informed the UNHCR in Tanzania to request its assistance. In this correspondence the registry gave the names and addresses of persons living in a refugee camp in Tanzania. On the 6th of October a staff member was sent on mission to the field and was able to locate three of those witnesses that he should -- was intended to bring to Arusha. The fourth witness has temporarily absented himself from his camp and we were not able to contact this person. And the three other persons were put back to the country of origin. According to the Defence, the witness who had temporarily moved was no longer part of the final list of witnesses as of the 14th of September 2003. And we only received this information on the 6th of October 2003. Therefore, as a follow-up of the contact established with the office of the UNHCR in Dar es Salaam, as well as with the UNHCR office on the ground, this section has the honour of informing you of the following points. The three Defence witnesses that we are discussing here had been informed of the investigator's intention to call this person to come and testify in the Gacumbitsi trial. And when they met with this person, the investigator took photographs according to the administrative procedure that is usually followed. Nevertheless and subsequently, the three witnesses told the UNHCR that they were going to accept voluntary repatriation organised by the UNHCR at the request of the Tanzanian government by voluntarily signing the forms for voluntary repatriation. It is important to highlight that on the 2nd of September 2003, the Tanzanian government decided to repatriate the remaining Rwandan refugees to their country of origin, with the exception of those persons who had already obtained the refugee status under UNHCR protective status. So in cooperation with Tanzanian authorities, the UNHCR was able to finalise the practical modalities of the repatriation of these persons and their repatriation was implemented. UNHCR in Tanzania also informed that they did indeed receive the correspondence dated 9 September from the ICTR sent by the registrar of a result of the communication on that same day from the Defence team of the final list of Defence witnesses. At our section's request the UNHCR in Tanzania was willing to give us the name of the préfecture and communes from which these three persons came and so we immediately forwarded this information to the Defence team, and it was now their responsibility to locate the witnesses and to confirm that these witnesses were willing to come and testify for the Defence in Arusha, and this before our section could undertake any measures to bring these persons to Arusha to testify for the Defence. So, in view of the fact that three witnesses were not immediately available this section did everything possible in order to move forward the travel dates of three other witnesses who were scheduled to come and testify in two weeks' time, so that these witnesses could be available for next week's session. Therefore, may the Trial Chamber please take note of the fact that eight witnesses shall be available next week and the rest of the factual witnesses, which are six factual witnesses, they will come in the appropriate time and can be heard during the third week. I wish to thank you, Madam President.</p>

            <p>Madam President, I have heard the information provided by the section representative. I received this information yesterday after the hearing, and the only thing that causes some difficulty to the Defence is that the communes that are mentioned are communes from which these persons come. These are not the communes to which these persons have moved to. Nevertheless, as of yesterday we notified the section because of the advice and we received a mission letter and we sent our investigator on the ground for him to attempt to locate or obtain information about these persons, but I would like to say, Madam President, that it is very difficult for the Defence. These persons provided their photograph and their identity and their statements, and this information has been with the Tribunal for at least three weeks, and these persons that we cannot find, their statements are in the hands of those persons who deal with these matters. So how is it that persons that know that they have to come, who have signed documents and were willing to come, how can they have voluntarily left without leaving a forwarding address? It is voluntary because this is what UNHCR has said, but the only thing that we can do is take note of the fact that these persons are not available and that we cannot find them. But we have dispatched an investigator on the ground to see if they can find these persons, and we hope that they will be able to locate these persons. And this is all we would like to add, Madam President. But at the present time, while we await for the section to provide us with additional information, Witness ZIZ is ready to be heard this morning.</p>

But as I lived very near by, I thought perhaps before continuing my work I should go home to see what was going on, and when I get home there was nobody left.

            <p>At that time the people were trying to repair the doors to the shop and pick up the goods that were scattered around.

We will ourselves accomplish the work that we must do." That was their song, their chant.</p>

            <p>Well, I did not see any other vehicles carrying gendarmes. It was perhaps those gendarmes or others who had arrived earlier, but in any case there were gendarmes. The people I saw were gendarmes. I beg your pardon, I used a French word, but I could not have used any other word. There were either people who had arrived earlier or gendarmes we had seen on board the vehicle that came and passed in front of Alfred's house. I cannot specify whether they were the gendarmes we had already seen.</p>

            <p>An order was given. There was someone there who was very active, someone who I knew very well. He had been in the army before but he was now a reserve. His name was Twagirayezu. When the men were lined up and their positions assigned and they were ordered to prevent anyone who would try to jump over the fence I noticed that this man was very active in the organization of the attackers at that time. Twagirayezu is spelled as follows: T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Z -- R-A-Y-E-Z-E - T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Y-E-Z-E-U, T-W-A-G-I-R-A-Y-E-Z-U.</p>

They were wearing uniforms that were similar to that of soldiers, the only difference being -- and I don't know how to say it in Kinyarwanda -- as a matter of fact, the only difference was in terms of the berets they were wearing. The gendarmes had red berets whereas soldiers had black berets. There were also the paracommandos who had camouflaged hats. So, you see, I knew the gendarmes all the same.</p>

            <p>Initially, when the attackers were lined up and shown the positions where they should station themselves in order to prevent those being attacked from escaping, one of the leaders of these groups -- I'm not sure I know his name; I was not able to find out what his name was -- said "Whoever believes he is innocent should step forward." And a few persons left the parish compound, they were afraid, they were crying and they would throw themselves into the arms of the people they saw, and they would move amongst the attackers who were stationed in front of the parish. Then he said, "Isn't there anyone else who remains in the group who believes himself to be innocent?" There was a lot of noise from the inside. They threw a few stones, spears, and arrows but in vain. The lieutenant said, "As this is the way you are behaving, all of those who are outside the compound should lie down," and they started throwing grenades and they shot guns. The doors, windows were broken into. It was terrible. I mean, seeing such a scene was extremely difficult.</p>

            <p>No, I was outside the compound. The main difference is that I have been brought there by force, but it was very difficult for me. It was horrible for me to see what was happening. People were dying in a horrible fashion. I don't think that I could say that anyone here has seen someone be torn apart by a grenade. And I did my utmost to avoid looking at the scene by hiding behind other persons to try and extract myself from this place so -- because I couldn't watch the scene, but I was not able to because I was weak, and I remained there.</p>

At that point I was afraid, and they were forcing me to go, and I was trying to hide behind the people, and this person struck me on the head and I was injured. And I went in because I wanted to save my life. And I met persons who were carrying a cooker, and I helped them to carry the cooker. I pretended to help them to transport the cooker, and when we reached the vehicle near the road -- or at the road, rather, I looked down as if I needed to go and urinate, and then I decided to flee with a group of persons who were attempting to flee, and I went to hide in a bush.</p>

So what I shall do is to make my employee available to you, because there are many other persons coming from neighbouring communes and who were going towards the passage point to go through the border".So I went down, I left, and along the way I came across other persons, including a man from Kayonza whose name was Paul. We greeted one another. He told me about his situation, I told him what had happened to me, and we went to the crossing point, but we were not able to cross the border on that day. We reached a place called Ruzinga. It's a small island on which a refugee camp had been set up, and the reason we left that place was because of the mosquitoes that were there. People were falling ill, catching malaria. And we continued up to -- over to Tanzania, and this was around the 18th. But on the 16th, I did not remain in the region.

That is when I reached Tanzania through the Migera crossing point, which was monitored by a Tanzanian ferryman whose name was Sos <stage>(phonetic).</stage></p>

            <p>When you were in Ruzinga, if I am pronouncing the word correctly and if that is what you actually said, when you were in Ruzinga, did you hear that the bourgmestre or the responsable de secteur had given the order to prevent people from crossing over into Tanzania?</p>

            <p>No. I am telling you what I know and what I was a witness to. All the persons who fled towards Tanzania came through Rusumo commune, and I believe that the conseiller and the bourgmestre did not prevent persons from fleeing and from crossing the border into Tanzania. So no order was given to prevent people from going into Tanzania. Moreover, many other persons who were not natives of the commune came through this checkpoint to cross the border. </p>

            <p>Witness ZIZ, you told us that in the morning of the 16th you decided to go towards Tanzania, and you asked your friend Alfred if he wanted to go together, and he said that he could not leave because he did not know what had happened to his parents. Is that correct?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that's correct. Alfred needed to know what had happened to his parents and to his sisters, and he said, "I cannot leave them behind. I am going to wait and see if they will join me, and if possible, I shall go to Rukira to collect them so that we can leave together".</p>

            <p>After crossing the border through the Migera crossing point, I spent a great deal of time trying to see how I could possibly survive. You know, people who have a profession or trade can try easily to make ends meet. I was asked to build a wall, a supporting wall to support a house, and so I built the wall. And a few days later, I was told that a camp had been established in Benaco, and the person for whom I had built the supporting wall paid me, and we went to the Benaco camp with the persons I was with. And once I reached the Benaco camp I saw my friend's father, and I asked him for news, and I told him that he had helped me a great deal. And he said, "You can now mourn for him because he is already dead." And I asked him when he had died and how, and he told me, "The circumstances of his death are unexplainable". And when he went to Rukira to see his father, a few days later, around the 17th, 18th and 19th,, the RPF had already moved into the region, and he was appointed bourgmestre of the commune. And he was asked to gather the people, to restore security and safety to the commune, and he was appointed bourgmestre of the commune, and the criminals were going to be arrested and judged and the others would be declared innocent. After that, the old man, Alfred's father -- I don't know if should mention his name or not, but he said that the RPF had killed Alfred's pregnant sister and she was thrown into a latrine. And when Alfred wanted to find out more about the circumstances in which his sister had died and having mentioned these killings, he was also killed. And Alfred was killed by RPF soldiers, because he had mentioned his sister's killing and that of many other persons who had been killed.</p>

            <p>No. I didn't go to Rwanda because of problems of public safety that been reported to me, and events that occurred in my home area and the area where I resided led me to decide to find another place of refuge. I left Benaco camp and I joined the Burundian refugees, and I was compelled to learn Kirundi by force so I could pass as a Burundian refugee.

            <p>Did you ask me whether people were being led in a group along on the road? If that is the question, yes, indeed. People were being beaten up, others were avoiding being hit by clubs and batons, and we continued on our journey and we left.</p>

            <p>My question, Witness, was, these captors you say were rounding people up, telling them that they had to "work," to kill accomplices, would you now have us believe that all they did, having named you and others as accomplices, was to put you into a large group of people and walk you along the road?</p>

            <p>Witness, you told us that the people who captured you were saying that you were accomplices, and they were saying, "Go, go." You said, "I didn't know how many people were pushing us. They were threatening us and told us to leave." Do you remember just having said that?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, at the time the term "work" meant to kill. That term acquired that meaning following the massacres that occurred in Rukira. That was the first time I understood that particular meaning of the word. In view of the fact that I knew that meaning, when they asked us to go and work, I understood immediately that it meant to kill the people who had sought refuge in Nyarubuye.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>And you understood that without being told you were going to Nyarubuye. That's correct, isn't it, Witness?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>I had already heard that. I had already understood that, but I did not have the means to do otherwise. I was very afraid, and I person <stage>(sic)</stage> was insignificant. I saved my life because I was feeling pain. People had hit me and they had spat on me. I tried to hide in the crowd in order not be hit, but that does not mean that I agreed with the work which we were being called upon to do.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Witness, when you walked from Alfred's place to the parish, you told us that you hid on the way. Where was it that you were hiding?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>I said that it was at a professional school that we call CERAI. Very close to that school were rocks, and you could hide between those rocks. That is where I hid with Alfred, but it was in vain because we were flushed out and we were even seriously beaten up because of this attempt to flee.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>Oh, yes, oh, yes. They were very angry. It is not necessary to know a person, but when you see a person, you'll find that he is completely transformed and there is no sign of humanity in the expression on his face. That is how I can describe those people.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>They were wearing ordinary clothes. They had folded their trousers up to the knees. They were wearing either coats or vests, and there were grenades or machetes or clubs dangling on their belts. When somebody has hitched up his trousers up to the knees or dressed in the manner I just described, you should understand that it is not ordinary clothing. Those people were frightful, frightening to see.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>I don't know why you keep coming back to this question. What I said was that I was wounded at the parish. When we were forcibly asked to lift objects, someone hit me with a plank, which we call technically a madrier. Of course we were hit, but I wasn't wounded and I didn't bleed. The wounds I incurred were at the parish, and that is where I bled. I noticed in the parish that people were carrying cupboards. I tried to assist them. All I did was put my hand to the cupboard and we carried the cupboards right to the vehicle. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>When you were found hiding amongst the stones, what were you beaten with?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>I said that they were carrying batons and clubs, and on their belts dangled all these traditional weapons, and they would use the clubs to hit you on the neck to hurt you and to force you to do what they wanted. They had no pity. Those people hit you very seriously. I don't know whether you have ever witnessed such incidents in the past. There is an exercise that cattle rearers do. They sprinkle products on cows to kill lice or ticks. And when the cattle is reluctant to move in that direction, they are hit with sticks. It was similar to that. They were hitting us, and if you tried to flee or to fall out of line, they would -- they could hurl -- they could throw lances at you or kill you with guns, because some of them were armed with guns.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, I want you to listen carefully to the question that I am asking you: You have told us that you were seriously beaten by these very, very angry people. I'm asking you, what did they beat you with? You personally, what did they beat you with?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>I notice that you want to dwell on the fact that I was hit, on the fact that I was wounded. I told you that I was wounded by a blow that I received with a plank. Before we got to Nyarubuye, we were hit with batons and sticks. These were the sticks they used to hit me. I was very lucky. Some of the attackers had cables, and they were using these cables to hit people. I was lucky that they used only sticks to hit me.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>You perhaps did not properly understand what I said. There were some vehicles moving ahead of the crowd; there were others following behind. It was the people who were transported in those vehicles who stayed behind and were hitting people, beating up people in their homes. I don't know whether before these vehicles came there were others that had passed, but there were vehicles that were following behind and that were conveying the attackers.</p>

If you are taking down some notes, you -- I am sure you would have found what -- these details.</p>

            <p>Have you properly understood what I said? I told you that there were vehicles that had passed well before. I know the vehicles. The vehicle leading was owned by the gendarmes. There were others following, and I don't know who owned them. A short while later, the others went to various houses to rally people. I don't know the number of vehicles; however, behind us there were vehicles, but I can't tell you the exact number of vehicles there were.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ziz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZIZ:</speaker>
            <p>Are you referring to the vehicle that was in front of the others? It was a pick-up, as far as I can remember. It was a white pick-up, if my memory serves right. But as you see, in the prevailing circumstances, remembering the colour of the objects you saw and to remember such details nine or more years later, it's not easy. You're asking for the colour of the vehicle, whether it was white or yellow. What I saw was a gendarmerie vehicle moving at top speed, and behind that vehicle were others following. As regards the colour of the vehicle, I crave your indulgence. I can't quite remember, but I know it was a pick-up.</p>

And subsequently, those who arrived joined the group that had preceded us, but there were still leaders who gave orders as to where people should position themselves.</p>

            <p>Well, I think it would be difficult to line people up in that manner. You know, if there's a crowd and people are elbowing one another and they are forced into the crowd, I am not sure this will bring us to -- lead us to anything. I am not sure I can explain this. There is people that are being pushed and forced to go. So there was no specific, normal procedure that should be followed. There is no order to follow. There is a certain amount of disorder. And I don't think I can answer your question, unless we were to actually take the time for me to tell you exactly how events followed one another, for me to tell you about the whole sequence of events.</p>

They are the ones who perpetrated the atrocities. Of course, there are others who wanted to assist them in their work, so subsequently, they went all the way up to Nyarubuye to perpetrate the same atrocities.

Because according to what he said, it might -- the witness might not be in a position to testify tomorrow, either. That is the situation, Madam President. Perhaps we could go and see him to see if he could come tomorrow. Otherwise, all my calculations are not bearing out. I don't know what I can say to the Trial Chamber -- what remains for me to say to the Trial Chamber. Yesterday I said I hoped he could testify today, and today we were told in the course of the hearing that even tomorrow he might not be able to testify.

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, I have a request consequent to your order that we proceed with two Judges under Rule 15bis. So maybe they could hold on until I have made my request before bringing in the witness. Your Honours the Prosecutor requests, consequent to your order made under Rule 15bis, that the Registry be ordered to make appropriate arrangements to have the testimony of the witnesses that maybe heard in the absence of Judge Reddy to be recorded on video, and placed under seal for the benefit of Judge Reddy who is absent from these proceedings. Your Honours, this request is predicated on the fact that the image of a protected witness is never recorded on video in normal circumstances where all the Judges are present. It's my understanding Your Honours, that Rule 15bis presupposes that an absent Judge will have the opportunity not only to read the transcripts of proceedings he or she may have missed, but also the opportunity of viewing the video tapes of such proceedings to assist the Judge in assessing the demeanour or credibility of said witness. I am reliably informed, Your Honours, that the practice in our sister Tribunal, ICTY, The Hague, is that images of a protected witness, are recorded, and the tapes placed under seal. This issue recently came up and was very contentious in the recent appeal, in the Butare case, when it was discovered that contrary to the practice of the Hague, images of protected witnesses at the ICTR are not video taped. I raise this matter, Your Honours, because it has ramifications in the event of an appeal. Simply put, Your Honours, we pray that for any witness who testifies in the absence of a third Judge, the image of that witness be recorded on video and placed under seal for the benefit of the Judge, who is absent in the proceedings. Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. Counsel Kouengoua, do you have a few comments that you would like to make with respect to the motion that has just been made by the Office of the Prosecutor?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. The motion that has just been filed by the Prosecutor is pursuant to Rule 15bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The Prosecutor has moved that the Trial Chamber order that the testimony of the witness be recorded on video because one of the Judges is not present. The question that the Defence would like to raise is whether pursuant to Rule 15Bis there are any provisions that state first of all, that there can be a video recording of a protected witness. If there is no provision to that effect, then an exception should certainly not be allowed. If Rule 15 which our colleague mentions, the provision that should be taken by the Trial Chamber with respect to dealing with the absence of a Judge, and not with respect to a witness, be the witness for the Prosecution or Defence witness. I do not see how one can ask that a protected witness be -- testimony be recorded and that should be done pursuant to Rule 15bis. Madam President, the Defence has not yet found anything that would state that one can make a video recording of a protected witness. And in the absence of such a possibility being raised, it is not possible to make an exception. We need to use the principle as the foundation and further to that exception, not raising the exception and then apply this to the principle. The protection deals with a witness not with a Judge or Judges. Protective measures deal with a Judge. And to our knowledge, we know of no legal provision stating that one can make a video recording of a protected witness, and, therefore, Madam President, unless this information that's coming is brought to our attention, we are of a view that the Trial Chamber can not possibly grant the Prosecutor's motion.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, before I was interrupted by registry on technical matters, I wanted to make a simple rejoinder to Defence Counsel's submission.Your Honours, it's common sense that these proceedings are reported both on audio and video. In short, that is the Rule. The exception is that the images of protected witness aren't recorded, for the simple reason that: One, all three Judges are present, and can observe the demeanour of the witness in the box. Absence of a Judge, Your Honours, common sense dictates that that exception be lifted for the benefit of the Judge who is absent, otherwise this would be a paper trial, Your Honours, that we submit the transcripts are not sufficient. The Judge or Judges have to have the benefit of observing the demeanour of a witness as that witness testifies. And with current technology, you don't need a rocket scientist. It's simple to have a camera turned on the witness with the express condition under Rule 75 that that tape be placed under seal, like the proceedings in closed session are placed under seal and all identifying information concerning a protected witness. Most obliged Your Honours.</p>

But actually there's case law to that effect and in the first part of the trial, at least two Prosecution witnesses who were heard in the presence of only two Judges and it was never -- no request was ever made that the images be recorded, and I think that we should follow set practices set before this Tribunal by the Prosecutor himself, and I do not see why it should be change this way of proceeding.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua.The Trial Chamber is of the view that Rule 15bis doesn't obligate the Trial Chamber to make a recording of the testimony of the protected witness on a videocassette, to allow the absent Judge to view the tapes. However, this could be useful for the absent Judge, and in view of the reservations stated by the registry, we would rather wait for the registry to clarify whether it were possible from a technical perspective because I would admit that I had asked this question to the Registry, and I was told that Judge Reddy could not be here, not only this week but possibly even next week, and the registry had informed me that at this present stage it was not possible. However, the registry, did advise me that they were going to speak to the technicians and see what was possible, because if the parties are willing that we continue to sit with two Judges, if Judge Reddy does not return by next week, in that case we could only sit under certain conditions in view of the provisions of Rule 15bis. Therefore, we shall continue and we shall see what is the best -- would be the best position to be adopted. I would like to thank you, and I would now like to ask that the witness be brought in.

          <sp who="#witness-xw9">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW9:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, we fled on the 28th. When we came to the falls, at the border crossing into Tanzania, in view of the fact that there was a large number of people, vehicles and cattle and a huge crowd that was crossing the border, very slowly, at about 3 p.m., the Inkontanyi arrived. They intercepted those who had not reached the border crossing but those who had reached that point could cross into Tanzania. I was amongst those who had to go back with my wife and five children. Between my house and that point we could walk for about two hours, a distance of about two hours trek but it took us three days. We had to hide along the way. We often saw Inkotanyi either killing people or doing other things. So we were obliged to hide in the woods or in sorghum fields. It was raining and that is why it took us three days. We got to our home on the 5th, at 2 p.m. I saw three soldiers and an Inkotanyi arriving. They came to my house and met me there. They arrested me, they tied me up. They tied me up, yes. I saw an Inkotanyi tearing off a kitenge cloth with which he covered himself, and I saw that he had a bag containing little hoes, and he used part of this material to tie my hands with it, and he tied my hands behind me. And they took me to a certain Mugarura where we met many other people who were also tied up. They kept us there up to 5 a.m. At 5 a.m. they led us in single file right to Bicumbi in the Nyabitari secteur. At Nyabitali. I collapsed and a soldier shot at me but none of the bullets hit me. They continued leading the others who were with me and they killed them a little later, 20 metres from where I was, and I saw them killing them while I was lying on the ground and after killing them, those soldiers boarded the vehicle and left. It was roughly 6 a.m. in the morning. After their departure I got up and I looked for somebody who could untie me, and I was lucky to find my elder brother and he was the one who cut the bonds. And I felt relieved. I can even show you on my body the scars left by the ropes, the bonds. Ten years later you can still see them.</p>

So I pursued the change in his story. I put the question to him, you knew he was Inkontanyi, didn't you, because he was Tutsi and that's the point at which we got the second version of his evidence and he has now returned again to the first version.

            <p>I think that the Prosecutor is pushing the witness in a direction that is not his. He doesn't even know who the prime minister was. Twagiramungu -- I mean, how could you put such a question to the witness and ask him whether he was against the prime minister. Does he know who was the chairman of his party? We can't continue like this, Madam President, if we want to know if this person knew Twagiramungu, we should ask him, but we can't say that he was against Twagiramungu when he hasn't even told the Trial Chamber who Twagiramungu is, and he is not an expert. He said that he is an ordinary member in his cellule. I think that we need to review the line of questioning that is being put to the witness. Madam President, please, I mean, we need to follow the examination-in-chief. I don't believe that at any point he raised a political matter, please.</p>

            <p>Madam President, I'm leading this witness because I am cross examining him. And it is my understanding that that is the purpose of cross examination. I'm, therefore, not certain how I would rephrase the question unless I were to ask him an open-ended question, and that is not my understanding of the purpose of cross-examination. So I'm at a loss as to know how to rephrase, if I'm not allowed to ask leading questions in cross-examination. </p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>You shouldn't ask him leading questions. He puts question and then -- you put questions to him and he answers, but there were no questions put to him about his political opinions. It is true that people were -- questions were put to him about the MDR power, but you are currently clarifying those matters, and so, is it really necessary?</p>

            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>I think that is a different issue, Your Honour, if you consider that the line of questioning has gone as far as appropriate in cross-examination. And certainly if that is your ruling, then in this case, given the witness that is before you, I won't continue with the line of questioning. But the issue of leading the questions in cross-examination needs to be clarified, and I do request clarification. Defence counsel, on a number of occasions have, in my submission, wrongly objected to cross-examination based on leading questions. And quite clearly cross-examination is entirely founded on the basis that questions are leading. It is on that issue that I would require direction because I would intend to lead each and every witness in cross-examination. It is up to the witness to confirm or deny any propositions that are put, but certainly the process of cross-examination is, in my submission, entirely one that entails leading witnesses, asking leading questions. It is only in direct-examination and re-examination that closed questions -- rather, that open questions are the only type of appropriate questions for witnesses. </p>

Therefore, please proceed and do not make us lose time on this matter. I have no direction to give to you on this matter. We have just asked you to avoid asking questions that are too leading because the witness did not speak of Twagiramungu, you were the one who mentioned Twagiramungu.

            <p>Madam President, Your Honour, in view that we have just been given information that tomorrow is a holiday, we had scheduled to have here three witnesses today. I was wondering if the Trial Chamber could possibly request that a fourth witness be brought in today so that we can catch up, because with these problems, time has been wasted. If we could possibly hear four witnesses, Madam President, instead of hearing three, perhaps an order can be given to the witness support section for them to go and collect a fourth witness. I believe that this will allow us to gain a few minutes or hours.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I think that Counsel for the Prosecution's line of questioning cannot be followed by the witness. He had said a bit later and then he was told it was two months and he said it was the 6th and, "How can you say you only did one month?" How can he -- he must get lost with that sort of questioning. That line of questioning is not appropriate. I think my colleague is trying to get the witness to say things he didn't say.</p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, if I have followed, the witness said that he stayed a month. He said that he'd worked for a month and then he left, but now he's mentioned June. From April to June is two months. That is the question counsel for the Prosecution is requesting. I don't see where the problem lies. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>The witness first said, "I went" -- counsel said, "You left on the 5th." He said, "No, much later." And she said, "Well, then, you worked for one month." He said, "No" -- he said "yes" that time. But then, "You left the 7th of May?" "No, I left in June." And then counsel says, "Well, that's two months." So each time he says a bit later, he's given a date that he did not give. That is what is embarrassing. Thank you, Madam.</p>

So it might be a bit difficult to get through all the witnesses we have to hear and the expert witnesses that are due to testify. See if you can't prepare your fifth witness. We never know, it would allow us at least to gain some time. That's what I wanted to tell you, in case we finish early with the fourth witness. Thank you, all of you.

            <p>When he was arrested, he was led to the Sebijojo, conseiller's house, and since his security was not provided for, a man known as Pierré from Kankunga secteur went to the communal office to inform the authorities that the security was not provided for. When he got to the conseiller's house, he also observed that the situation was unsafe there, so he informed Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi. When Gacumbitsi usually went to Kankunga he passed through Gisenyi secteur, and he said, "The children take the president's death as a pretext to jeopardise the security of other members of the population." He said Kazungu was known in the area as an artist and as such, he should be allowed to move about freely and to go about his usual activities, and that is why Kazungu was released and he continued to go about his activities. The conseiller continued to do his duties as a responsable of that area as well. </p>

            <p>No, they were not threatened.

            <p>Gacumbitsi was someone who often helped people because he loved his work. So he came and intervened to assist Peter who had sought his assistance.

            <p>When I crossed the border, these people had security problems and I therefore crossed over with my wife and the other members of our family remained behind. Nevertheless, other family members crossed the border subsequently. There were various crossing points which could be used to go to Tanzania. I can give you an example, a person named Danny, another one named Jean and another person named Happynight and the last one would be Ndabalinze, xxxx and that would have been my xxxxxx x xx x xxx and his whole family.

            <p>I cannot return to Rwanda for the following reasons: I fled in 1994 and I returned in 1996. I remained there until 1998. We were prosecuted. My elder brother who manned canoes was ultimately killed. My paternal uncles and their children were killed. As I am of mixed parentage and my face looks like that of my father, I was continuously threatened. We had to separate, my wife and I separated. I was injured on my right leg and my left arm. We decided to flee and went to Tanzania. The second reason that prevents me from returning deals with my safety. In the camp where we are currently sheltered, there are former RPF soldiers and they pretend to be Congolese. And ever since I met xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx who wanted me to come and testify about the events that took place in my locality, anyone who met with this investigator was put on a list that has been forwarded to Rwandan authorities, and therefore, I wonder what will happen to me or what would happen to me if I were to return to Rwanda, at a time when anyone who does not support the ideas of the government in power are considered to be enemies of that power. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, do you speak and read French? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>No. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>In spite of your three years of post primary education, you do not read or speak French at all? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Training in CERAI institution was provided in Kinyarwanda. We had French lessons but the scope of those French lessons was quite limited. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And I believe in the eight years of primary education you also learnt French, isn't it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I studied French. Throughout the countryside we studied French, but education was provided in Kinyarwanda, our mother tongue.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So I would be correct, Witness, to suggest that you can read French and understand it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>No, if I could read and understand French this would mean that I know the language. There is no point in being able to read if you cannot understand. So I cannot understand written text, a text written in French. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>I believe, Witness, when you were interviewed by Defence investigators, you were interviewed in Kinyarwanda? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that is correct, we spoke in Kinyarwanda. </p>

            <p>Witness, in 1992, prior to the advent of multipartism in Rwanda, is it correct that all Rwandans were members of the ruling MRND? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Rwandans belonged to different political parties. The MRND existed, but there was also the MDR party, the CDR, the PSD, PL and other parties whose names I don't remember. Not all Rwandans -- therefore not all Rwandans were members of the MRND.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

            <p>Madam President, the indictment deals with the period beginning with January 1st, 1994, and the Tribunal is not allowed to deal with matters that occurred before. The witness is being asked to provide informed about events that took place before 1992. That is a factual witness, Madam President. </p>

            <p>Witness, can you please answer my question? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>In answer to the question as to whether all Rwandans were members of MRND, I cannot answer your question -- I can only speak -- if you ask me what party I belonged to, it would be impossible to know what party this or that person belonged to. I can only speak for myself. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, I am talking of a period prior to multipartism, this is prior to 1992 when other parties were legalised. Do you understand that? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>I can understand you, which is why I answered that I did not pay attention or was not interested in other parties. You know there are persons who have no political interest or affinities. You can't ask me such a question because I cannot know what party all Rwandans belonged to. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I put to you a proposition, Witness, that prior to 1992 all Rwandans belonged to the MRND; it is either yes or no? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Well, as far as I am concerned, I wasn't a member of the MRND. As I do not speak on behalf of all Rwandans's side, I could have told you that I was a member of the MRND. Therefore, I am giving you an example; I was not a member of the MRND, and I believe that I am Rwandan. I think that this question should not be put to me. For example, I was not a member of any political party. If you say that all Rwandans are members of the MRND, then you are including me in a fact that is not true. I have told you that I was never a member of the MRND. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, is it your evidence that prior to 1992 there were other parties in addition to the MRND; is that your evidence? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>As I have stated, the MRND party existed, but I was not a member of that party. And yet I am Rwandan, why are you insisting that I be a member of MRND?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, I am not insisting. Now it is true, isn't it, Witness, that in 1996 your wife returned to Rwanda and still resides there? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>We returned to Rwanda together in 1996 as things should be and we fled together again as things should be. My wife is still alive. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>If you would allow me, I can give you a detailed explanation and tell you in what circumstances she is in Rwanda, this is with your leave, of course. If I am not allowed to proceed, I shall not proceed obviously. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>The question is simple. She is currently in Rwanda, isn't she? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>She has not returned to Rwanda because of reasons that are dependent on me. She was forcibly returned to Rwanda and I was not with her when she was forced to return. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, I will take you to the events of April 1994 and specifically to the 9th -- let me say the 8th of April 1994. Do you know who arrested Kazungu? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Kazungu was arrested by a person living in his native cellule in Gisenyi préfecture or rather in Gisenyi cellule, in his native cellule Gisenyi.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And did you witness the arrest?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>I saw him when he came to our cellule as I am a native of a secteur in which the conseiller lived. I therefore saw him when he was being brought in by those who had arrested him. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it also would be true, Witness, those same people, the members of the population, on that occasion also arrested Sebijojo, the conseiller of your secteur? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>No, they weren't the ones who arrested him, those who arrested Sebijojo came from Mahama and the others came from Nyamugari. These criminals, I cannot assimilate them with members of the population because ordinary citizens abide by the law as it was before the war. So these criminals came from the places that I have mentioned. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, you still haven't answered my question, namely, whether the same criminals who arrested Kazungu also arrested Sebijojo on that same day and occasion. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Kazungu lived in Gisenyi cellule as I have stated. Sebijojo lived in Kigufi cellule. These two events occurred on different days. Kazungu was arrested on the 8th and he was taken to the conseiller on that same date. Gacumbitsi arrived where we were on the 9th. Therefore, you will understand that these events took place on different dates. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, I am fully aware that you purport that Gacumbitsi came to your secteur on the 9th, but you still haven't answered my question. Was Sebijojo your conseiller also arrested by the same criminals who arrested Kazungu on the 8th of April 1994, it is either yes or no? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>The conseiller was never arrested. What happened to him actually was that he was attacked at his residence because of the Kazungu matter. Those who attacked the residence of the conseiller came on the 9th. They came from Mahama cellule Nyamugari secteur. We ran up and we interposed ourselves -- so we interposed ourselves against those people and they turned around and left. As to Kazungu, the conseiller had security problems because he had given him shelter. The other problem, that is the conseiller's, is very different from the problem of Kazungu.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So it would be your evidence, Witness, that Conseiller Sebijojo was never arrested? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Conseiller Sebijojo was never arrested. Those who attacked him found him at his residence but they did not arrest him. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>After Gacumbitsi left between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., so I believe that he left between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. and the attack took place after he had left. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I said that Gacumbitsi arrived on the 9th. Sebijojo had a security problem as a result of the fact that he had given shelter to Kazungu. And it was with this piece of information that I began my testimony on the matter, and I have nothing to change in that regard. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it would also be your evidence, Witness, that Kazungu was released subsequent to Gacumbitsi's intervention on the 9th of April 1994? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it would be correct, Witness, to suggest that during the purported attack of Sebijojo's residence on that day, Kazungu had been released and was not present? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>I have explained on several occasions what happened and you insist on putting the question to me. Kazungu was released after Gacumbitsi left. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>It still doesn't answer my question, Witness, namely, whether Kazungu was present during the purported attack on Sebijojo's house. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Are you doing this on purpose? When Kazungu was taken to Sebijojo's house Sebijojo could not rescue him, could not be very assured because of Kazungu being there. When Kazungu was released so that he could continue with his work, it was Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi or it was rather, thanks to the intervention of the bourgmestre; thanks to the intervention of Gacumbitsi. This took place afterwards. He was released or the events you are referring to took place after Gacumbitsi left. You seem unwilling to accept the truth I am stating here because I am the one who was a witness to these events.</p>

            <p>When one is independent, working for oneself, one works according to the hours one decides for oneself. I myself organised my work. I'd say such-and-such work; I'd do at such-and-such time. Some people take 30 hours to do something; other people take an hour. So I worked especially in the morning, and in the afternoon there was very little work compared to the morning.</p>

After having said what he had to say to Kankobwa and spoken to the people of my cellule, the inhabitants of my cellule, he did not stay very long. However, if you allow me to make an estimate, I think he didn't stay more than 45 minutes, but again, that is only an estimate. I was not wearing a wristwatch.</p>

So he's not asking to confirm, he's asked to comment on the answer, whether it's true or not. I don't think that's allowed by the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. </p>

It was an amendment to the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and in particular, Rule 90 <stage>(G),</stage> which was adopted this year.

            <p>Absolutely not. I never talked to Nyamugali in my examination-in-chief. I don't think so. At this hearing on this day, I didn't do it. Perhaps you can interpret the law as you like but I never put it to the witness, and I don't think the Trial Chamber should admit the question but Article 90, if you're quoting, then it is important for -- to read Article 90. The Article reads, Article 90, and tell me where it says that he's allowed to lead the witness in cross-examination or in examination-in-chief, but I, as an examiner in-chief of the witness, never mentioned Nyamugali, until I am proved to the contrary. </p>

            <p>Your Honours, I did not refer to Nyamugali, first of all. I referred to Nyakarambi. And my submission is that is the Prosecutor's case which I am putting to this witness and Rule 90 <stage>(G)</stage>
              <stage>(ii)</stage> reads, and I quote, "In the cross-examination of a witness who is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party, counsel shall put to that witness the nature of the case of the party for whom that counsel appears which is in contradiction of the evidence given by the witness." Simply put, Your Honours, the Prosecutor led evidence that at the times this witness is indicating, Gacumbitsi was in Nyakarambi. Two: At no point during Defence cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses did the Defence suggest that on the 9th of April 1994, Gacumbitsi was at Sebijojo's residence in Gisenyi secteur.

            <p>So, Witness would you please answer the question, namely, whether you told the Defence investigator of the purported attack on Sebijojo's residence after the departure of Gacumbitsi on the 9th of April, 1994?</p>

            <p>Do you want me to answer your question by a yes or no? This is the truth that I know and which I came here to tell you. I know that there is legislation governing examination of witnesses. I haven't studied law, but the facts that I stated here occurred as I said, and I haven't changed anything in my statement.</p>

            <p>Witness, you still refuse to answer my question. Maybe you didn't understand it. Let me simplify it for you. You were interviewed by a Defence investigator by the name of Marvellous Sunguha, is that correct, yes or no?</p>

            <p>We met the first time, and the second meeting took place on the 14th of June 2003. That is to say that I did not meet him on the 13th and the 14th, I only met him on the 14th of June 2003.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, you mentioned the first time and the second time. Is it your evidence that you met him twice on one day or that you had met him on a date before the 14th of June 2003?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-xw1">

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Now were you interviewed on both these occasions, Witness, that is, on the date you do not recall, and on the 14th of June 2003?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, the question is very simple. Did the Defence investigator interview you on both these occasions, namely, the date you do not recall, and again, on the 14 of June 2003?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>During the first meeting there was a short interview because I just arrived from my place of work, so we spoke for a short time. It was only during this second meeting that we had a lengthy interview.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And you will agree with me that an attack by assailants on the residence of a conseiller immediately after the departure of a bourgmestre is a serious security threat, isn't it?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>The problem was posed in the manner in which I just described to you.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So would it be your evidence, Witness, that you told the Defence investigator about this serious breach of security occurring immediately after the departure of the bourgmestre?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>I told him that the situation, was as I described it and I spoke about the events that took place at the house of the conseiller with respect to Kazungu and the events that took place at Pierre's house.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, please answer the question. Don't evade it. Did you tell the Defence investigator on the 14th of June 2003 that there was an attack at the house of Sebijojo after the departure of Gacumbitsi? Yes or no. You either told him or you didn't?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>I don't know, perhaps you are unwilling to understand my version of the truth. I have clearly stated that during my interview with the Defence investigator, I told him how the events unfolded, and how the attackers came to that place but I did not clearly state exactly what was the order in which the events took place. I did not give him the exact chronology. Perhaps you are reading something on a piece of paper but what I have told you is the truth. I don't think that the fact that you have repeated the question will change my point of view, but I believe that you are not accepting what I am telling you. How do you want me to answer you?</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, I have told you to answer specifically to the questions that are put to you. Answer the questions in a concise and clear manner. He has asked you this question on several occasions but you have still not answered the question. Have you understood what he said? You have spoken of events that took place at the residence of conseiller Sebijojo. He has asked you if you told the investigator what you have told us. Did you tell the investigator, yes or no? It's very simple. You must answer the question that is put to you. Otherwise he is going to put the same question to you again because he doesn't have an answer.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I never refused to answer. I told him that I spoke with Sunguha about the events that took place at the conseiller's and about the events that took place at Pierre's. So how do you want me to answer? Perhaps you could tell me how to answer him. I am telling him the truth but he does not want to hear me. Perhaps he has another goal, another aim. But the truth is the one that I have told you. I did not lie about anything.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, I would like to read to you a portion of your statement and subsequently ask you a few questions, and I quote: "There was no security problem in our secteur until 9th April 1994. On that date a certain Peter came to inform the bourgmestre that attackers had arrested Kazungu and conseiller Sebijojo and threatened to kill them under the pretext that they were RPA spies. With that information Gacumbitsi went to the locations. He informed the population that it is in their interest to protect themselves against troublemakers. I would add that Kazungu and Sebijojo were released".Witness, you told this Chamber earlier on that Sebijojo was never arrested. In light of what I have just read, do you maintain that Sebijojo was never arrested?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>You see, the problem that is here is that when you cannot move from where you are, you cannot leave from where you are and you can only move when the security is re-established. This is the same as being arrested because Sebijojo could not leave this place and Kazungu, and Kazungu could not leave until his problem was resolved. It was in that light that I made that statement.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So it is now your evidence that both Kazungu and Sebijojo were under arrest, am I correct?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Yes.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it was your evidence earlier on, Witness, that subsequent to Kazungu's arrest, he was taken to the conseiller, Sebijojo's residence where he was detained over night; am I correct?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>Actually Sebijojo's arrest was actually more to the fact that he could not leave his house and go elsewhere. Moreover, he was accused of being an Inkotanyi accomplice. So the matter was resolved by the arrival of Gacumbitsi.</p>

It is now 5:35 p.m. We have problems, Madam President. I think we need to take this into consideration. Time has become way too dear before this Trial Chamber, and we need this time beyond examination and cross-examination. Time is dear for this Trial Chamber and for all the parties. The clock is on this side and I would like the Prosecutor also to be able to see this clock before he proceeds any further. I thank you, Madam President for this.</p>

            <p>Yes, sir. But you will also remember, Counsel, that we have had to intervene on several occasions to ask the witness to answer the questions. The problem is that the same question has to be put to the witness on several occasions before he answers and that is where the problem comes from.</p>

            <p>Now, Witness, let me go over my proposition again. I am not suggesting for a moment that you didn't know Sebijojo, no. All I am saying is that on the 9th of April 1994, between dawn when you got up to go to work and when you first set your eyes on him that day at 0300 p.m., you didn't have any personal knowledge of his whereabouts because you hadn't seen him that morning?</p>

I had gone to work in the morning and at 11:00, I had returned from my place of work. I don't know, perhaps you can guide me so that I can answer your question. So that I can provide you with a satisfactory answer. What period are you referring to? I have never refused to answer any of your questions.

But as I was tired, I did not go there, I went back to work and upon my return I had my -- had a meal and then I rested and then I went to his house. And so I expected to return to work at sunset.

            <p>No, he didn't go to any meeting, and I didn't think anybody could lie to me on that subject, and all the vehicles pass my place of work. In fact the truth is that he never left his residence. No, no one can suggest to me that he went anywhere. I was working in a place overlooking the road and there was a communiqué asking everyone to stay at home following the death of the president. So he couldn't go anywhere, he was at his residence.</p>

            <p>Yes, I went to my place of work because I went by foot, or I could go by bicycle but as far as he is concerned, in view of that distance between his residence and the commune office which is considerable, he could not go by foot.

            <p>Witness, I will take you back to your witness statement made to investigator Sungura <stage>(phonetic),</stage> on the 14th of June 2003. Now, from the portion I read to you, Witness, it is correct, isn't it, that there is no mention of an attack on Sebijojo's residence subsequent to Gacumbitsi's departure; is there?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-xw1">
            <speaker>WITNESS XW1:</speaker>
            <p>As to the extract you read there is a mention of the attack against Gasumba and Sebijojo, that means that the people who brought Gasumba brought them to Sebijojo's resident so that the attack was against two people. In fact, as I told you the conseiller was also suspected of being an Inkotanyi, accomplice. And it is under those circumstances that I say the attack was against both people. So, I'm telling the truth and briefly and equally here are names that I gave you in my testimony that are not in the written statement. So it should not be a pretext for asking me the same question on a single point. If you want to repeat your question, I will give you the same answer.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President, when I came here today I didn't know that tomorrow was a public holiday. However, before the cross-examination of the witness, I told the Trial Chamber before I had some information to impart. I thought that in view of the difficulties we face, I wonder whether it would not be possible in order to avoid 15 bis to hear as many witnesses as possible here in Arusha before the time limit of five days that is what I wanted to discuss.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>But it all depends on you. Here I see that you have five witnesses remaining plus the witness who is ill, it all depends on the party. We can very well hear all of these witnesses. It all depends on how long you take to exam and the cross -- and how long it takes to cross-examine. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>That is why I am raising the problem here so that all parties can agree on that. It is not my sole responsibility. You saw the last witness, I took 40 minutes but the other party took two hours. I don't know if we are going to go on like that. But if we work by consensus, if we could escape from the grip of 15 bis, then let us do so. Now, if -- does counsel -- if counsel for the Prosecution agrees with me, are they prepared to, I don't know. But I don't know what the other trial, Cyangugu or whatever, the maximum of witnesses in the minimum time, we can avoid the cut off date of 15bis, but I think that the expert witnesses don't need protection as is the case for the other witnesses. So perhaps we could hear the maximum of witnesses of fact. I think that we could progress without worrying our heads about 15 bis. That is a suggestion that I want to make if all of the parties agree. Now, if the case were to be the contrary, it would be up to you, Madam, to intervene, but that is my modest contribution I wish to raise that question today.</p>

Good morning to the interpreters and the court reporters. Before I give the name of the witness the Defence intends to call first this morning, I would like to advise the Honourable Trial Chamber that this witness is the one that we had been waiting for and had to deal with quite serious health problems. And with his agreement, of course, we thought that perhaps we could hear his testimony this morning. But Madam President, Your Honour, I would like to ask the Trial Chamber for the following -- I would like to make the following request. I hope this witness will come to testify, but I think that we should consider his testimony as given on his hospital bed. Even though I have not been told what exactly he is suffering of, he is still not feeling well now, and I would respectfully request that all parties take into consideration the health of this witness. Moreover, Madam President, the Defence is of the opinion that as Rule 15 bis is still an application, we are considering other hypotheses, at least on the Defence's side, to see how we can find other solutions to this delicate problem that we have had to deal with. But we shall make our application at the appropriate time. And so, Witness ZHZ shall now be appearing before the Trial Chamber this morning. I thank you, Madam President.</p>

            <p>Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours. The Prosecutor is inquiring whether his application to have these proceedings recorded on video is going to be resolved within this session. The second point is that Counsel did not have the courtesy of informing this Chamber of the change in the order of witnesses. According to the list filed on the 13th of October -- the 10th of October, Witness MG1 was supposed to be followed by Witness YCW. Counsel has just mentioned that Witness YEW is the one to follow MG1. If we could have a clarification of that, Your Honours?</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>As to your first application, we had stated what our opinion was of the matter, and we are still waiting to hear from the Defence, because as we had stated, we need to know whether the appropriate technology is in place so that -- to suggest something that would be agreeable to all parties. And the Defence, of course, was supposed to agree or not, as these are Defence witnesses are protected witnesses. Now, as to your second question, I will turn to Counsel Kouengoua and see if he has any explanations to provide to the Prosecution with respect to the change in the order in which the witnesses shall appear.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. The reason for this change is not due to the Defence; we are having to face an exceptional situation. The witness that is appearing this morning is the one who should have testified almost ten days ago, at the beginning of the trial. And I think all of the parties, even those who are not concerned -- like the witness support section -- are concerned by the health of this witness. And the physician, I believe, has raised certain delicate matters, and we have to deal with this. Do we keep this man with witnesses when, in fact, he should have completed his testimony and then gone to the hospital? We don't know. And we have had to face this difficulty, Madam President. And we felt that we should bring Witness ZHZ as soon as possible. Now, as to the second witness, the second witness is the one that we communicated since the 10th of October. And Madam President, I don't believe that any problem should arise from this because if we were supposed to hear -- as we were supposed to since the 10th -- two or three witnesses per day, that is true, we would not have reached this witness. But we are just saying, if we put ZHZ instead of MG1, that is because there was this situation. However, as far as YCW and YEW, the last letter that the Prosecutor is referring to, it states as follows: "As far as Witness BK1 -"</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. I thought that as the list had been disclosed since the 10th, it would no longer cause any problems. With respect to Witnesses NG1, XCW, YEW, UPT, BK1, these are amongst the witnesses listed in the last paragraph of my letter dated 10 October. And I had stated that this was done with all due reservations -- subject to certain reservations because we had advised the Trial Chamber that we wished to proceed fast -- fastly, but we couldn't. We weren't sure that we would be able to proceed in this manner, so we had said subject to the availability of the witnesses, and also taking into consideration the fact that when we sent the list, the witnesses had not yet arrived in Arusha. And this is why the Office of the Prosecutor feels there is a change, when, in fact, there is no change. The Trial Chamber is following the logic imposed by the situation. We have not changed anything.</p>

            <p>So, you don't know whether all of these witnesses had arrived on Monday, and you were not able to verify that they had arrived because -- you know, the question that has been put to you is that you have reversed the rule. The point isn't the witness. We understand that ZHZ was ill and is now testifying because he is feeling better. We all understand that. But as far as Witness NG1 and YCW, which you have scheduled to testify this morning, you have changed the order, and that is the question that was put to you by the Prosecutor. </p>

            <p>We may proceed with the witness, Your Honours, subject, of course, to my availing Your Lordships of the letter of 10th October given to us by Counsel. He has referred to Witness BK1. Witness BK1 does not appear in this letter. The order is clear from this letter, and it is disruptive, to say the least, when this order is changed without due courtesy of informing us. I called Counsel at 2:45 on Friday, 10th October, and he said he had delayed in filing this order of appearance because witnesses hadn't arrived. Now, he informed me that he had just been informed as of 2:45 on Friday that the witnesses had, indeed, arrived in Arusha as of Friday. Now, he could have informed us on Monday, a day before yesterday, if he intended to change the order. Basically what I am saying, Your Honours, it is disruptive and we may be compelled to seek a short, maybe ten minutes' adjournment so that we, you know, can arrange our documents and prepare for the cross-examination of an unexpected witness. Most obliged.</p>

Counsel Kouengoua, I think that you will also understand the problem, because if they prepared to cross-examine one witness and they are given another witness, this can, of course, cause problems in the order of the -- in the work of the Prosecutors. Therefore, we would like to ask you to disclose the order of appearance of your witnesses and to abide by that. If there is a change, you must inform everyone in due -- with enough time to allow everyone to deal with this matter. In any case, you may now proceed with Witness ZHZ.

            <p>I was a member of that party because the MRND had been in power for a long time.

The liberal party that was born, its devout purpose was the pursuit of liberty, so I thought I could join that party because I thought it could be a forum where I could express my ideas. Consequently, certain of the PL party's objectives coincided with some of the RPF's objectives. RPF said there was injustice, oppression, and that is why I said that on certain points, the PL party was on the side of the RPF, in the light of what I just said.</p>

He knew very well that I was a member of the PL party, but he did not hold it against me. He did not hold it against me that I didn't belong to the MRND, nor did he hold it against me that I hadn't joined the MRND. As long as I knew him, his political affiliations were not made public. When he had come -- he had been appointed bourgmestre, the MRND was the only political party.

            <p>As we went on exchanging our ideas, we were wondering about our safety, our well-being and the situation that prevailed in the country. As I have stated, in our area there were many Tutsi, and there was a problem. I would say the killing started in our locality, and we were surprised by those massacres. Neighbours sent us messages to say, "Have you been informed as to what happened?" The head of state was killed and you know about it, and in the meantime we see people coming with their belongings. And when you ask a friend, coming towards you, a question, he would answer, "My house has been set afire"; mostly people from Rukira. Others would say, "My property has been looted; I don't know where my son has run to." And we asked them, "Well, how did you come here?" They answered, "Because we are coming through our secteur, Nyarubuye secteur, because we note that here things are still calm in Nyarubuye parish. And when these problems of public safety will have been settled, we will go home. And if the situation gets any worse, since you are close to the border, we will cross into Tanzania. And we hope that no one will chase us there, hunt us down there." And we stayed with the refugees until the number of refugees at Nyarubuye parish grew. About the 9th or the 10th, until the 14th, the number had grown considerably, so a problem arose. The inhabitants of -- we the inhabitants of Nyarubuye, we had been warned by the Rukira authorities, and we saw leaflets according to which we were being warned, that we, the inhabitants of Nyarubuye, were giving shelter to people who had killed the head of state. And the tracts the leaflets, said, "You will see, we will deal with you." So on the 14th, the morning of the 14th -- and you know that we were not carrying on with our normal work. You know, that when one has lost a relative, when someone has died, a member of your family, you stop whatever you are doing until the person has been buried. So in the meantime, on the 14th, in the morning of the 14th we received a message according to which these people who were warning us would -- were coming for us to explain to them why we had sheltered refugees at Nyarubuye parish; therefore, we took the decision to defend ourselves because in our locality, the populace was united. So, in the morning we got together, and again, we exchanged ideas, the Hutu and the Tutsi.</p>

            <p>Thank you. I wanted to finish quickly. My concern was to get it over with quickly. May I continue? At the time we were meeting on the 14th, the people who had sent us that message attacked. They had whistles. They were carrying weapons; they were carrying machetes, lances, spears and bows. They came from Birembo, which is opposite from us. And I told you that they told us that they were coming, and we wanted to be ready since we were united, anyone who could find a weapon, whether it was a machete or a spear, took up his weapon. And we decided to defend ourselves. Someone who was with us, who was an ex-soldier, told us, "Let us go and face the assailants." And the skirmish took place at Birembo. They began setting houses afire, and moreover, six people were killed, six of the attackers were killed. And we also captured two people who were considered to be ringleaders, very well known people who had important -- important positions in the civil services and who were influential members of the political party. The two people, if I come back, the two people captured, among them there was François Gisagara, who worked for the ministry of public works and was very influential in our region and well known in the MDR party. We captured him in the company of Antoine Hakizamungu, who had been running -- managing an agricultural cooperative known as Twibumbebahinze. So we captured them. We had requisitioned a vehicle in Nyarubuye parish. We put them in that vehicle, but they were not beaten, and we took them to Nyarutunga. So we decided to take them to the authorities so that they could be interrogated, and after having heard what they had to say, we were going to send them to the communal office so that they could be charged or we could also transfer them to the military. </p>

            <p>Witness ZHZ, I interrupted you when you were saying that you took those two people to the Nyarutunga centre to question them. Could you continue, please?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, I will continue. We arrived at that centre, and while we were still surprised and wondering where we would start questioning them, we were told those people were known to be honest and now how are we going to question them. Shortly thereafter, we saw eight soldiers -- or eight gendarmes arrive. They were accompanied by youngsters, and these youngsters were among the attackers, and they had managed to flee to go and alert the gendarmes in Mulindi. So when we saw the gendarmes arrive, we were very happy, and we told ourselves that the attackers would be punished. We stayed there, nobody left, and we told ourselves that we were going to report these cases to the gendarmes. The gendarmes greeted us, and we told ourselves -- we spoke to the gendarmes saying, "It is good that you have arrived as security will be provided for now." So, as you can see, the members of the population who were present were afraid. So we told the gendarmes how houses were burnt down and what all of the attackers did. And the gendarmes told us, "We have the last words. We have heard your version. Remain calm and listen to our own version." And they told us, "Those of you who have arms should lay them down. And now we are going to work together. Don't be afraid. As you can see, we have arms and we shall provide for your security." So we laid down our arms and they showed us where to stand. In the meantime, the eight gendarmes surrounded us and stationed themselves around us, because we were at the market. They started putting questions to the people we had arrested. The man named Gisagara was shouting at the top of his voice and saying he had been tied up. So they asked him what his name was, and he said, "My name is Gisagara". They asked him, "Who tied you up?" And he said, "There is a man known as Vincent Hakizamungu. I don't know, but could you please untie me. "The gendarme called Hakizamungu and he answered, and they ordered him to untie this gentleman so that they could question him. Hikizamungu untied him. "And since you have untied Gisagara, you can also untie Antoine," which he did. And they told him, "You have done well to untie these two men, so sit down there and rest a little." So they had him sit on a stone which was used as a prop for a swing -- a balance, I beg your pardon, which was used for measuring coffee. They said, "Don't make the mistake of fleeing. You know we are soldiers. None of you should say anything because we are the ones in charge of the situation." In the meantime, we acceded to their demands because we did not know their plans. They told Gisagara to point out any other persons in the crowd who were considered as ringleaders. Gisagara named persons he wanted, and it was observed that he was naming mostly Tutsis. He named a certain Ruberandinda, another person known as Canisius and several others, because there were many people there. One of the soldiers said, "Now we are going to take the decisions, bearing in mind what are you saying, because the people of Nyarubuye had suffered." They continued saying, "We heard a grenade explosion, but who exploded that grenade," they asked. They mentioned the name of a certain Rwangriahe, who was a demobilised soldier. They wanted to know where Rwangriahe was, but Rwangriahe had just fled on board the vehicle we had used to bring those people to that place. However, Rwangriahe's father was courageous enough to say that even if Rwangriahe is not there -- is not here, "He is my son. If you like, I could bring him to you." So they ordered him to sit down near Vincent. They prevented us from fleeing because they wanted to implement what we had requested of them, they said. They asked us what were the wishes we had expressed to them, and we told them that our wish was to punish the criminals. So we told ourselves, we are going to see how they will punish those criminals. They asked the people they had asked to sit to say their last prayers, because they said, "Your plans have been accomplished," they said. They immediately shot dead Vincent and the old Bahutu. </p>

            <p>In view of the fact that the refugees who came were being pursued and that we had started tracking down Tutsis -- or that they had started tracking down Tutsis in their area, I would say that most of those refugees were Tutsi.

            <p>I fled with old people, old women. Each person fled in the direction of the area of his choice. As for me, I fled to an area known as Nyabitare since I had worked in Nyabitare and I had many friends there. So I told myself that I had to go there because that area was safe and I had many friends there and I could stay with those friends. I arrived in Nyabitare in the evening and I sought refuge in the home of a friend known as Cyridion Matabaro. That was in the evening. I spent the night there. I related the events that had occurred in my area. But I believe they had already gotten wind of those events because the inhabitants of those various centres belonged to the same parish, that of Nyarubuye. The following day, very early in the morning, as we were no longer working, as I said earlier on, Matabaro and myself, as well as his neighbours and another friend known as Vianney Mutunzi, were in an area called Gasasangutiya near Nyabitare and we were trying to exchange ideas that morning, wondering what would have happened if we were attacked in that area. Shortly thereafter, youths started arriving from an area known as Cuvette. They were trickling in and there was also -- there were also some members of the Nyabitare population who were in that area, but those people were wearing banana leaves on their heads. When the number of these youngsters increased in the area where we were, they began asking us whether we had identity cards. And we said yes, we had. But since I had witnessed what had happened in Nyarubuye, I became afraid since the people had related the events to were also beginning to be afraid. Without any further delay, they told us, "If that is the case, show us your identity cards." Those who did not have identity cards began disappearing, one after the other; they fled. And those who had identity cards could show them. But as soon as you show them your I.D. card, they seized it. They arrested my friend, Matabaro. They also arrested my friend, Vianney, whereas he had not shown them his identity card. And they told them, "Come, we want to question you." They returned the identity cards to the people on whose identity cards was marked "ethnic group Hutu" and they killed the people they took away with them. I heard that my friend Vianney was killed. I heard that he was killed in a banana plantation of Bukambira near the Nyabitare school. They also killed Cyridion Matabaro, very close to the same banana plantation. The war continued raging and the situation was deteriorating. I didn't know what to do. I was afraid, and I told myself I left Nyarubuye, whereas the war was raging there and even now, here where I've sought refuge, the situation is no different. The leaders of the attackers included a man I knew who was a native of Nyabitare. I asked him how I could get to Nyabitare because I had problems to sort out there. He told me, "Do you know that you are a fool? Look for banana leaves. Don't tell anybody that you are going there. Hit the road. The people you meet on your way won't hurt you because it is common knowledge that anyone wearing banana leaves is a worker." So I escaped. I did what he had asked me to do. It was at about 11:00 a.m. I followed the road towards my area, that is, Nyarubuye.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. When I went home -- I went to my home, rather, to see whether any of my belongings had been looted. My neighbours were there and the bodies of those who had been killed the day before were there as well. They had not looted any of my belongings, but the doors were open. And a little bit later, during the afternoon, many vehicles started to arrive in that area. The vehicles came from Birembo, which was the locality from which the assailants had come from. When they reached the place where we were, they stopped. They had given instructions to the people so that people would not run when they saw them. They arrived in vehicles. Some of them had banana leaves wrapped around their heads, and there were even some who wore military uniforms. They had red berets. They told us that they'd heard there was a problem in Nyarubuye. They said that they'd heard that there was a problem that had not been resolved and that they had come to resolve the problem in Nyarubuye. They said, "Look at our vehicles; look at the direction we have just come from. We have come from far and we have come to help you." But we were actually afraid. They told us that any man who was strong enough should follow them and that those who weren't should climb into the vehicles, and that is what happened. But as I was tired because of the long walk from Nyabitare to my residence, I climbed into one of the vehicles. We left and the vehicles were driving slowly, and we were told that we were going to see what the situation was like in Nyarubuye. When we reached Nyarubuye, we stepped out of the vehicles. And those who had walked arrived. There was a big crowd, as if it were a market day. In the meantime, whilst we were there, they told us, "People of Nyarubuye, calm down." Some of the people who had come in the vehicles with the persons whose names I had already mentioned, like Gisagara, who had been tied up the day before, they stepped to one side and they held a short meeting. But in the meantime, the people who were in the vehicles, the people who were inside the vehicle cabs -- or, rather, I meant to say that those who were inside the buildings of the parish, because the windows were open, when they saw the crowd, they started to shout. They said, "You have come to kill us." And some people answered, "No, calm down; nothing will be done to you." And after the short meeting, a soldier who was known under the name of lieutenant -- I don't know what his name was, but he spoke, and he said, "Follow closely what is going to happen." And he spoke to a boy who was there and whose name was Kibwa. Kibwa is spelled K-I-B-W-A, Kibwa. So he asked Kibwa to call out for those who were innocent so that the innocent could step out, outside. So Kibwa went out to the entrance of the parish gate and with other young people, he said, "The innocent should come out." But people answered from the inside, "We are all innocent. Kill us, but you shall pay for this." But some persons came out because they felt they were innocent. I saw a young priest, for example. I don't know his name. I also saw approximately five girls, and they even specifically called out for Louis Ntamazeze, and that is spelt N-T-A-M-A-Z-E-Z-E. And after that they readied themselves and asked if there were any other innocent persons who had not yet stepped out. In the meantime, they had surrounded the location and controlled all exits. And they had stream mortars affixed -- attached to their rifles, and those near the doors had grenades, and that was the first time that I ever saw such weapons. And us -- I mean, we were onlookers; we were almost like onlookers and we were in the back and we were afraid because we didn't know what was going to happen. And I don't know what the lieutenant said, but I heard him say, "Hey," and the people who were in the front started to shoot out the windows. The others who were at the entrances were arming their grenades and then lobbing them into the buildings. When I heard the first explosions, I did not hesitate. And even the others who were afraid, just as I was, we slipped away because this was our native area and no one could follow us. And we returned to the place where they had found us, but I no longer spent the night at home. I went to a place known as Rutunga and I went to the house of a neighbour who was a friend. She was an old woman whose name was Kabesime, and her sons were my friends, and they were considered to be some of the brave young men of the area. I remained there until the day I left Rusumo commune. I would sleep there and I would stay at Kabesime's house when I was awake and I would stay there, and I stayed there thinking that no one would attack me there because they were strong young men. The situation continued like that for some time, and the next day it was as if the firing gun had been launched for the massacres. We heard that so-and-so was killed, and another person was killed. And the situation continued in this manner up until the day when the RPF forces arrived in that area, and then we had hope that the RPF would free us. This was on the 28th, at 6 a.m. We heard gunshots throughout the locality.</p>

            <p>I was talking about the day the RPF came to free us. It was the 28th of April 1994 and it happened at 6 a.m. So we heard gunshots, and those who knew the sounds, who could recognise the sounds, said that Kalashnikovs were being used. Almost each house in Bugarura was surrounded. In the morning, they didn't fire at people. And they came and brought us together and led us to the Nyarutunga dispensary. There were many of us and anyone who had -- and we were all together, Hutu and Tutsi alike. They told us, "We have come to save you." We stayed there until 1 p.m., and when they realised there were many persons, the RPF also wanted to start killing the people, and I am amongst those who were able to escape. Amongst those who were guarding us there was a young boy who had been my student. We called him Matwi at school, and that is spelled M-A-T-W-I, Matwi. But his real name was Butera. Butera is spelled B-U-T-E-R-A. He came up to me and told me in a low voice, "In a few moments, the situation might worsen. If you can, pretend to go to the toilet." And he didn't need to speak to me at length; I immediately understood what he meant. So I looked to the right and to the left, but no one was watching me or followed me. As I was moving away, I came across other persons who were slipping away, just as I had, because someone else had given them assistance. When I reached a distance of approximately one kilometre away, I heard steady gunfire, and I stopped in a place called Kagabaro, K-A-G-A-B-A-R-O, Kagabaro. And many other persons were there. They had all sought refuge there and they had not been captured by the RPF. We waited for night to fall. We took everything we could to cross the Kagera River and go to Tanzania. So I spent the night of the 28th of April in Tanzania. I left the papyrus marsh at 3:00 in the morning. </p>

I stopped nearby and I let my other family members continue ahead so that I could follow what was going to happen. Some time later, all my friends and former neighbours -- I heard that all my former neighbours were killed. I, therefore, turned back and I sought refuge elsewhere because we had been expulsed from Tanzania. I, therefore, did not go anywhere else. But this was for clear and obvious reasons.

What makes me afraid, makes me fearful, is that friends who did no wrong and who were hunted down because they belonged to opposition parties, but who were arrested, who disappeared when they went back home, when they returned to the country. I don't think I would be exempt, that I could avoid that if I went home.

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. Whoever worked in our country and who wasn't a farmer was a civil servant, and as I was a teacher, I was considered to be a civil servant. That's the meaning in which I intended it.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>It wasn't the communal office that was paying our salary; it was the school inspector, the communal school inspector, who paid our salary on the basis of the lists he was given.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. In the Rwandan educational system, education system, there were lists of teachers in one or two communes and every month the ministry would send the salaries and they were paid, and they signed the list. We didn't have accounts at the bank so we were paid in those offices.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>

            <p>Witness, I'm talking of when you were gainfully employed as a civil servant. There appears a break in the payroll which suggests that for many months you did not pick and sign for your salary. Am I correct?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>I don't see what period you're referring to, because while I was working as a civil servant, I was paid my salary, but I know that from time to time our records were not kept up to date. If, for example, for a period you were receiving 15,000 francs a month, at the end of the month you might see that the amount given is 13,000 francs, so one had to chase up the ministry to see what was happening. I know that that sort of thing occurred.</p>

            <p>Counsel for the Prosecution, the private life of this witness does not really interest us. So if you could round up this line of questioning without this revealing his identity, it would be better to do so. But if you insist on pursuing this line of questioning and going further, which could lead to the revelation of the witness's identity, we would be obliged to order a closed session.

I abide by your decision that pursuing this matter, if I must, should be done in closed session so as not to divulge the identity of this witness. What I would propose, Your Honours, is that I am going to pursue the criminal antecedents of this witness in a closed session, but so as to not disrupt proceedings, I can move on to other questions now and reserve this line of questioning towards the end of my cross-examination, where we can go into closed session. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>No, I did not say that I heard about it. I said that I witnessed that fact. He was killed close to a school in a banana plantation owned by a certain Rukanda, that is what I said. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, in your evidence this morning you told this Chamber, and I quote: "I heard Viyane was killed in a banana plantation near Nyabitare".Are you now telling the Chamber that you actually witnessed with your own eyes the killing of Viyane Mutunzi? </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>That is correct, because bearing in mind the area where the group was, the group in which I was, it is there that he himself was. We were led to an area where that person was killed. We were in an open area and when we were asked to show our identity cards, there came a time when Matabaro and others were killed in an area which was not open, I mean in a secret location. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, you still haven't answered my question. This morning you told Their Lordships that Viyane, Matabaro and others were taken away, led away by youths, and you learned or heard that Viyane was killed in a banana plantation. Now, my question is, do you maintain that you heard that Viyane was killed in a banana plantation or that you actually witnessed the killing of Viyane Mutunzi? </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Unless we do not understand one another for language reasons, as regards the massacres, I did not say that I participated in his murder, whereas he was killed while I was near him. As you see, we were in the same group. A member of the group was taken and led somewhere; other members of the group were led away to another location. You could hear the sound of someone crying or shouting. What prevents you from understanding that he was being killed, whereas you weren't there on the spot? If you say that those people were not killed, you should produce evidence to the effect that those people are still alive. That person was a friend of mine; I cannot say that he died when he is living, he is alive. I cannot do that because his death caused a lot of suffering to me. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, you still haven't answered the question, but let me simplify it for you. What was the distance between yourself and Viyane and the killers when they were killing him? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>A short distance. In any case, it was not more than five metres. If you knew the geography of that area, we are talking about a banana plantation that was fenced up, and if someone was six metres away from you, you can realise what was happening just from the noise that you heard. I saw these people leading him into the banana plantation. They led him somewhere else and I heard him crying out saying, "You are killing me". And I know the circumstances under which he was killed. Don't insist on the circumstances in which he died because it caused me a lot of pain. Furthermore, if you conducted investigations, you would find out that he was very close to me. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Witness, you have told Their Lordships that the distance between you and Viyane and the killers was five to six metres; was there anything obstructing your view, i.e. between you and the killers and Viyane? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>That is what made me say that I witnessed his death. When he was attacked with traditional weapons, I could see that the assailants led him away to that area. I knew them, a certain Rukutu -- I knew him, he was a tramp in that area. It was a banana plantation belonging to Rukambira. It was a banana plantation that was fenced up, so there was an obstacle preventing me from seeing what was happening. Besides, I could not prevent them from doing what they were doing because I myself was in trouble. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, we would save time if you just listened to the question and answered it as it is put to you. It was simple and didn't need a narrative. Was there anything obstructing your view in the five or six metres that separated you and Viyane and his killers? Yes, was there something obstructing your view, yes or no? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, there were trees and there were green banana leaves because we are dealing with a banana plantation, so there was some obstruction. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And in those five to six metres, approximately how many trees blocked your view, Witness? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Listen, I did not count the number of banana trees, but it was particularly the green leaves of the banana trees that obstructed my view. It was indeed the green banana leaves that obstructed my view. And let me add that I was afraid, and on account of that fear, I could not observe what was happening. I don't know what you want to know exactly. Do you want to know what arm was used? What I know is that he cried out and this caused me a lot of pain. I told myself that is the end, he is dead. I didn't see others killed. Subsequently, I tried to gather information and I indeed got to know that he was indeed dead. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So it would be your evidence, Witness, that because of the banana trees and because you were frightened, you actually didn't see the assailants kill Mutunzi? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Regarding this question, it seems as if you want to assert that that person was not killed. This, notwithstanding -- I told you that I asked a certain Xavier, since the situation was getting worse, "What should I do?" He said: "Cover yourself with banana leaves". But it was precisely at that time that I heard Mutunzi cry out, and I knew his voice very well. I could recognise his voice. He was someone with whom I had had friendship ties. They led him away to that area and it was in those circumstances that I assert that he was killed. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>If you recall the explanation I gave in this regard, you'd realise that the assailants shared out the victims to be killed among themselves. One was led away to this side, another to another area. And after I heard the noise, the cries of Mutunzi and Matabaro, I told myself the next person will be me. Even if my identity card had been returned to me, I wasn't sure that these assailants would come back and kill me in turn. Those two people had been killed. Subsequently, someone told me to leave the area. I told him I was afraid -- someone had told me my house had been looted, so he said, "Try to slip away". He seemed to be very active, and I told myself I could slip away without fear of being arrested. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So by the time you slipped away, Witness, had Mutunzi been killed? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Indeed, he was already dead. That is, by the way, one of the reasons -- what I mean is, the cries were one of the reasons that obliged me to leave. I had seen people being killed in Nyarubuye. I had seen the circumstances in which they were killed. If you ask me to tell you what weapon was used, it would be as if you are asking me to say whether I participated in his murder. I was afraid, I was in pain but I was very sure that when I left -- by the time I left that area he had already been dead, and I can confirm this because his death caused me a lot of pain. You see someone is led away some five metres away from you, you hear him cry, groan; what conclusion can you draw other than say that he has been killed?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>

            <p>As a matter of fact, that was not my native area, I didn't reside in that area. Furthermore, most of the attackers did not hail from Nyabitare, they were rather people who came from the countryside. So I could recognise Rukutu because there were assistant drivers I knew, and that is why I could recognise him at the time we are referring to. </p>

            <p>I find that a bit surprising, Counsel, because everything that I have stated here since this morning, I don't think that all of that appears in my statement. The Defence investigator wrote a summary, he asked questions as they wish and therefore I could not answer questions that were not put to me. What I did state here before the Trial Chamber, I did because you gave me enough time to speak and tell you everything I know. If you are telling me that this does not appear in the statement, I don't think that I can be blamed for this. Perhaps you should put your question to the Defence investigator and ask the investigator why he didn't write this or that. I did not even reread the whole statement because I did not believe that I would have to come and testify in Arusha, and I therefore believe it is not necessary for us to dwell on this matter. </p>

            <p>If it pleases Your Honours, it wasn't a comment but rather a proposition that the Prosecutor is entitled to put to the witness within our limits of cross-examination. You do realise, Your Honours, that the death of Mutunzi is pleaded in the factual allegations of the indictment where we allege that Gacumbitsi had Mutunzi and Rukomeza killed in Nyabitare near the Catholic centre on the 15th of April 1994. At no point during cross-examination of Prosecution witnesses did the Defence put it to the Prosecution witnesses that Mutunzi was killed by other people as advanced by this witness. The point I am trying to underscore, Your Honours, is that, this is a very important point of Prosecution, it is pleaded in the indictment; it doesn't appear in this witness's statement and comes up for the first time during his testimony. So, I am entirely within my limit, Your Honours, to suggest this witness did not see the killing of Mutunzi as he alleges and that is why it doesn't appear in his witness statement recorded in February this year. Now it is up to the witness to confirm or deny my proposition with a yes or no, and I am ready to move on. But it is erroneous for counsel to suggest that I am making a comment; I am making a proposition for this witness to confirm or deny. I am most obliged, Your Honours. </p>

It has been claimed on the other side of the courtroom that during our cross-examination, at the time when Prosecution witnesses testified, that we did not go over the death of Mutunzi, but the transcripts are there. We have asked several questions, and I believe that at the time it was said that Gacumbitsi was not the one who killed Mutunzi, because in the indictment it is alleged that Gacumbitsi killed Mutunzi personally. And I believe, Madam President, that we have also filed a motion pursuant to Rule 98 bis, and we have also discussed this matter at length, and I believe that they are mistaken on the other side of courtroom when they say that we did not go over the death of Mutunzi during our cross-examination. I think that my learned friend on the other side of Bench would have liked us to reveal all of our strategy so that they could easily harass witnesses on the stand as they are currently doing. </p>

I believe that ever since Monday to be specific, the Office of the Prosecutor is making propositions, he is saying things. He is saying that there is a text of law that says -- but he didn't cite the jurisprudence. If that is the case, and it is an important point, I who used to be a cross-examiner, the Prosecutor could have told the Trial Chamber such a Prosecution witness mentioned Mutunzi's name and this is what happened, and he wasn't cross-examined on this matter. I do not want the Trial Chamber and Defence counsel to have to deal with the trial by ambush. I mean, how can we say that Mutunzi was -- Mutunzi did not do -- the Defence counsel did not do their duty, but we need to stop cheating.

You put propositions to the adverse party's witness; it is a mandatory requirement. And with your leave, Your Honours, I will move on. If I may, however, just refer you to the transcript of 4th August during the evidence of Witness TAC at open session, page 42, lines 25 to 32, regarding limited cross-examination by Counsel Kouengoua of Witness TAC on the death of Mutunzi. The point we wish to underscore is that at no time was it ever put to that witness that Mutunzi was killed by Rukutu and others. And this is what this witness purports to have told Defence investigators in February this year, six clear months before the trial began or six clear months before the testimony of Witness TAC. Under Rule 90G <stage>(ii)</stage> counsel was obliged to put the proposition to Witness TAC; in the event that he didn't, he cannot now interrupt my cross-examination.

            <p>Well, in reference to your first question about the bicycle, I am not sure whether you need to have a bicycle to go to the commune. You have asked me a question about the bicycle and now you are asking me another question about visits to the commune office. I am sorry I don't follow you.</p>

            <p>Witness, I advised you that I will return to the question concerning the bicycle, so let's leave that for a moment.

            <p>Witness, I'm not saying you made such a statement. I'm putting the proposition to you. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>That is your understanding of the events, but I have my own understanding of the events. What I have told you here is what I saw. I went to -- I was in Nyarubuye, and I'm telling you about the events I saw. Persons who were eyewitnesses of other events can give another version, but I have given you a version of the events that I saw, and I do not wish to change my testimony in any way. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, maybe I'll read from your evidence this morning and ask you a question. Open quote: "When I heard the first explosions, I didn't hesitate, and the others slipped away because this was our native area and no one could follow us, and we returned to the place where they found us, but I didn't spend the night at home. I went to Rutunga, to the house of a neighbour." So it's true, Witness, that Kabesime's house was in Rutunga, isn't it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Now I understand your question. Now, as to the place where Kabesime lived, Kabesime lived in Murutunga , which is a locality which is close to Nyarutunga. So I didn't spend the night in Nyarutunga but in Rutunga, but this does not mean that on the day after, I would return to Nyarutunga. Nobody asked me a question about that, to find out if I was able to go close to my house in Nyarutunga. This does not mean that I remained continuously at Kabesime's house. It is not really a place that is very far from Nyarutunga. I could go close to my house in Nyarutunga, but nobody asked me any questions about that.</p>

            <p>Now, Witness, it's true, isn't it, that immediately the -- you heard the explosions, you fled. This is at the Nyarubuye parish on the 15th April 1994. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. I left that place, that's correct.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And by your own admission this morning, the assailants who were armed with stream guns and other guns and grenades were in front of you, isn't it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that's correct. Yes, they were in front of me. You know there was a large crowd before the parish, and we didn't know the layout of that area. Actually, those of us who were from Nyarubuye were considered to be cowards, curious onlookers, so we did not -- we were not given any orders to attack them, to shoot at them or to use bladed weapons. These attackers had come prepared, and they had weapons and were in the front.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>In fact, the group of assailants was approximately 2,000 people, and to use your phrase, it was like market day ?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I cannot give you the figure of 2,000. I could say that there was a large crowd, but I would not be able to say whether or not there were 2,000. I can only say that they were many, they were numerous.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>In truth, I did not have any weapons, but if they found you, you would leave with your weapon. People were never asked to take their weapons. We were standing near our houses. It was at a time of insecurity and I was carrying a small stick. It wasn't a spear or a machete, but I was never ordered to take a machete or a firearm. I was carrying a small stick that wouldn't frighten anyone, and that is how I left, carrying my small stick.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>I did not pay attention to watch the manner in which they surrounded the buildings.

It's true they surrounded the buildings.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>It would also be true, Witness, that curious onlookers like yourself, who were not armed, could not have been anywhere near the front where the gendarmes and other Interahamwe carrying firearms were situated?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Prosecutor, I should perhaps describe Nyarubuye to you. Perhaps you know the place. In front of the courtyard facing Nyarubuye, or facing the courtyard in front of Nyarubuye, you could see what's happening there, wherever you are among the crowd. I was witness of what was going on there. Wherever I stood didn't matter very much, wherever I was standing in relation to the crowd.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>But, Witness, it's correct, isn't it, that as a curious onlooker without a weapon, you could not have been at the front where the assailants with firearms were positioned?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>It is true, we were not standing in rows. It was a crowd that was looking on, and it must be said we were afraid. We were fearful. You're talking as though we were lined up. I was a bit far from the building, but I could see and hear what was happening.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>But, Witness, this morning you told Their Lordships that you were at the back of the crowd, didn't you? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">

            <p>And it would also be true, Witness, that between the first line of assailants who had firearms and grenades, and where you were -- or maybe let me rephrase the question. It's true, isn't it, Witness, that the assailants with bladed and other traditional weapons were between you and the first line of assailants who had firearms?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>I have not fully understood the question. Could you repeat it, please? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>I'm suggesting, Witness, that between you, where you stood at the back of the crowd, and the assailants who had firearms, there was a group of assailants carrying traditional weapons, like machetes, clubs and spears. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Other people were mixed. There were some who carried that sort of weapon, the sort of weapon you've referred to, but in truth, I did not have the time to observe them. The people I could observe were the ones who were in the vanguard, who were giving orders, who seemed to be most active. They were armed with guns and grenades. Some had traditional weapons, in particular machetes, bludgeons, spears, but there were few people in that category. They weren't very numerous.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it's true, Witness, that you were able to flee on hearing the first explosions because you were at the back of the crowd, isn't it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>That is correct. Yes, I immediately left after hearing the explosions.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So it would be equally true, Witness, that you actually never witnessed any of the killings in the mayhem that followed the sound of the first explosions. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>In speaking of massacres, that means killing. One knows what comes out of a cannon or a gun. People were screaming. We realised they were dying. So in such circumstances, how can I not claim to have been a witness to the massacres that occurred at that place? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, you may have heard screams and explosions, but you didn't stay long enough to see any people actually being killed. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>When you speak of people being killed, I don't understand what you mean. Or you mean that seeing someone falling down after having been hit by a bullet? I don't know. You see, people are together in a place, and you fire grenades into the group, you hear the exploding grenades. Do you think that you can perhaps imagine no one is being killed? I don't say that I helped to carry the bodies, that I saw one or another person fall, but what I'm saying is that when shots were being fired or grenades being thrown, it wasn't water cannon. These were arms that must have resulted in the deaths of human beings.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So it would be correct to suggest, Witness, that you yourself never saw any corpses as you fled? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>You mean when and how I fled from Nyarubuye to my residence, to Kabesime, or Nyarubuye in Tanzania? Which flight are you referring to? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>The flight from the parish after hearing the explosions. And it's my suggestion that because you fled immediately, you never saw any corpses. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. In truth, from the parish to my place of residence in Nyarutunga, no one was dead yet. The people who had been the targets of the explosions and the firing were inside the perimeter. It was only people who returned on the next day, who went to the vicinity of the parish, that saw bodies, corpses. Otherwise, I did not see any corpses except those I saw at my home place of Nyarutunga. It's only that day at Nyarubuye people killed. I hadn't seen people killed before that day, except the people killed at Nyarutunga. I hadn't seen any other bodies, any other corpses.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. Well, let's say yes, I went to hide myself somewhere, but I returned to my residence where I was living. No one was after me, so to speak. But I went to spend my night there; at least, that was my intention. So I spent the night where I said, and life went on in the circumstances -- under the circumstances I have described.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>That is correct. Yes, I did state that. But during the preceding days, that is from the 15th, I wasn't asked any questions about that, so that doesn't mean that I had left Nyarubuye. I was still in the vicinity of Nyarubuye. We were very anxious. They didn't kill us all in one day. They went on with their attacks. We would hear that one friend or another had been killed. We came upon people who were wounded. That was the sort of life we had in those days, at that time.</p>

When you say that I left after the 30th, it is not true, because the 28th is the day I left Nyarubuye, and that very night, I slept in Tanzania, so whoever wrote this statement committed a mistake. It is true I continued on my way on the 30th, but I'd already left that place. </p>

            <p>Now, you told Their Lordships this morning that on the 28th April 1994, at around 6 a.m., the RPF rounded up people in your neighbourhood and took them to the Nyarubuye health centre; is that correct? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that is correct. I stated that it was on that day that I fled to Tanzania, but it wasn't in the morning of that day.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>In the evening. I don't know the exact time, but in any case, it was after 6 p.m. That's when I went to Tanzania, at dusk. In fact, the RPF fighters could have arrested us, or other killers might have stopped us, so we had to wait the night to be able to move so that everyone had gone home and we wouldn't be stopped on our way.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>If you remember correctly, I said I left that place, I went on my way, and then I arrived at Kagimerura <stage>(phonetic)</stage> hill, where several people were sheltering. Some of them were ready to continue. They had some essential items with them. In fact, it wasn't far from Nyarubuye. We could hear the firing. We could hear explosions from Nyarubuye. We could see people running from the hill opposite. And I was waiting. I wasn't alone. There were other people also waiting there.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So it would be correct to suggest, Witness, that when you fled from your captors, on no occasion did you ever go back to Nyarubuye parish on the 28th of April 1994? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Absolutely. I never set foot again in Nyarubuye. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, I'm going to read the last paragraph of your statement and ask you a question. And I quote: "The soldiers continued to pick up people in Nyarubuye secteur, around the parish, and took them there to be killed. Before killing them, the Hutus were forced to prostrate and eat a piece of flesh from the corpse. That was how the number of people killed in Nyarubuye parish increased as RPF soldiers hunted down Hutus. When I saw that, I decided to flee to Tanzania and arrived on 30th April 1994."

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>I have explained that point. I crossed the border on the 28th, but once in Tanzania -- Tanzania is a vast country. I think there was a misunderstanding between I and the person who took down my statement. In fact, the final destination, it was on the 30th. We were walking, we were in a forest and we hadn't yet reached a place where we could rest as refugees. There was not yet -- we had not yet reached any centre of assistance. That's what I meant.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So is it also the investigator's mistake to state that you saw Hutus forced to prostrate and eat flesh from the corpses? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>According to the questions you've been putting to me, you asked me whether such thing or another occurred. You told me you were not there at the time of the events. I tell you when I left the place, but according to what was told to me, you may undertake investigations. You would find out the same thing. I don't know whether it's forbidden that I should repeat what was told me, but I was not a witness to that.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>But you told the investigators, Witness, and I quote, "When I saw that." Are you now saying that you never witnessed it with your own eyes but just heard about it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-zhz">
            <speaker>WITNESS ZHZ:</speaker>
            <p>Well, it depends. It depends on what acts we are talking about. I spoke of the events I witnessed. I also spoke of events reported to me by other people. I was not witness to any scene where someone was forced to eat a corpse, and you yourself, you put -- proposed certain things to me that were reported to you by other people. Inasmuch as I wasn't there, since I had been there, I met people who had been there, who joined me at the refugee camp, so it is not surprising that I should have mentioned things reported to me by other people. So when I say, "When I saw that," it doesn't mean only that day.</p>

            <p>The Prosecutor renews his request to have video footage of witnesses, and the last witness, Your Honours, is a clear example of why it is necessary that an absent Judge has the opportunity to view a video recording so that he or she is in the better position to observe the demeanour of a witness while responding to questions in cross-examination.

We had been talking about it in restricted session, we can go -- we can discuss it in open session, if you want. We are fully prepared to say what we have to say on the subject. </p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Can you tell us briefly what you have to say, Counsel? The question was raised in open session. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. Your Lordship, I think that the answer to the concern expressed by the Prosecutor is on page 3, paragraph E of the decision of the 27th of August, 2003, where the following is stated: "The Trial Chamber forbids any photograph, any recording, audio or video, or any sketch of protected Defence witnesses at any time, in any place, in the context of their cooperation with the Tribunal or of their testimony before the Trial Chamber, without the permission of the Trial Chamber and the protected witness." That is the decision the -- handed down by -- my position, Madam President, in respect of what was said in closed session was perhaps to find ways and means to get out of this impasse which concerns all the parties, the Trial Chamber in its entirety. That is why I said that having thought about it in a closed session, there could be something else than video recordings which -- on the subject of which a decision had been taken. Perhaps a reduction of the number of people who came here in the context of Rule 15. That's what I was going to say in closed session, but now we are in open session so that is what we think about it. And the Defence in relation to this problem -- and I should like it sincerely to be undertaken in closed session -- because in this Trial Chamber, on several occasions, the Prosecutor does not object when a Judge was absent and could not observe the demeanour of the witness, so the witness that should be seen is the Prosecution witnesses, because that is how the Prosecution's case is made. But he lets the witnesses go, he did not ask for recording, but when it comes to the Defence -- he did not say anything when he was concerned. Now it's the Defence's turn, and he is not part of the Defence. I am based -- I based my point of view on precedent, and I don't think there was any request to review, or there was no appeal against your decision. That is point of view of the Defence, and I take the opportunity to draw your kind attention to what we are doing. We in the Defence have proposed to cooperate with the August Chamber, courtesy and transparency in all we do. The question also raised by the Prosecution this morning was to say that if we accept after ZHZ that it was an I or a G or a W or -- then we would have the time to prepare cross-examination. Madam, I would state before the Bench that we never raised any such problem. On Tuesday, the 5th of August, 2003, in full hearing, the Prosecutor inverted the order of his witnesses. Instead of TAK, TAS, TAS and TBC were proposed to us while the hearing was in full session. We said that it disturbed our -- the order of the Defence, or the preparation of the Defence, but we were ready to go ahead, and the comment was made that it was not in anyone's interest for the trial to last eternally, and we complied at the time, and here again, in order to avoid delays, we presented the witnesses that we had in hand. </p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>We are resuming the session. We shall start by issuing an oral decision. The Prosecutor referred to the Chamber a matter regarding the video recording of witnesses to enable the absent Judge to watch the demeanour of the witness. We want to refer the Prosecution to the decision of the 23rd of December 2003 - 2002, in the matter of - so, it's - so it is the decision of the 25thof August 2003, forbidding that the recording of hearing of a witness be done. That decision forbade the recording of the testimony of a witness. The Chamber is of the opinion that in view of the current situation, and the matter in issue, pursuant to Rule 15 bis <stage>(D),</stage> since the replacement of Judge Reddy is not on the agenda and consequently the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber in the matter of the Butare is not relevant. However, the decision of the 25th of August 2003, cited by the Defence, and relating to the protection of Defence witnesses, prohibits any video recording or sound recording of witness - of the said witnesses. However, in the same paragraph cited above, the Chamber states that such recording cannot be done without his or her authorisation, and the permission of the protected witness. Consequently the Chamber denies in the current matter the Prosecution motion for recording of Defence witnesses who are protected. Counsel Kouengoua, with regard to P04 exhibit, do you have any copy of that exhibit, please? We would like to see it.</p>

            <p>The situation was still calm. I could move around freely. I went out in the morning to see if there wasn't any problem, if our houses hadn't been attacked. Then I had to go and visit my sister who was living alone and who was staying in Gatore secteur. So, I went to see her, as usual. While on my way there, I passed Gatore secteur office on my way and I saw two vehicles from Rusumo commune there. I did not dally; I only slowed down, but I saw the bourgmestre in the company of the inspecteur du police judiciaire of the police -- communal and judicial police inspector, and also a few other people.</p>

            <p>No, nobody attacked our houses. I remember very well. I do recall that there was shortage of beer and I wanted to have a drink. So I went to a place called Kiyanzi to look for beer. And there, in Kiyanzi, I met a man called Havugimana. I asked him where he was going and he told me he was fleeing. Then I asked him why he was fleeing and he told me that his elder brother called Oswald had told him that the bourgmestre could no longer provide for their security because he did not have the means, and that even those -- people who had been imprisoned had been released. So he told them that whoever had the means should flee. It was Oswald's junior brother who told me so. So I told him that may the Lord bless him and enable him continue his journey.</p>

            <p>Madam President, I believe that we are giving the counsel for the Prosecution unnecessary clues. You said that on the 12th, people were released. I asked if you recognised any persons amongst those who were identified. I believe the clarifications had already been provided by the Prosecutor himself. Perhaps this did not go through, as they were speaking at the same time. But as far as we are concerned, there is no further confusion. Is there? </p>

            <p>Your Honours, I pointed out this morning that we would be asking for an adjournment on account of the fact that this witness was not listed for today. The witness who was supposed to appear in his stead, after NG1, is YCW. Counsel did not even have the courtesy of applying for your Lordships' permission to vary the order of witnesses, he just entered un fait accompli. And I did mention that when there is such a change, it is disruptive based on the preparations we had. And as a result, I'm not in a position to proceed, given that there is only ten minutes to the adjournment. So, I pray that we take the adjournment now to allow me sufficient time to prepare for the examination of this witness tomorrow morning. And it is going to be very brief examination, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>I wish to apologise to the interpreters and the court reporters. Madam President, I was saying that on the 5th of August 2003, the Prosecutor had stated during the hearing whilst he had the floor to exam a witness, I believe it was Witness TAK, he informed the Trial Chamber of the following: "After reviewing the list of witnesses, after Witness TAK we were supposed to hear TAS, TAP and TBC. Unfortunately, we have been informed that TAP is unavailable and might not be able to come and testify today. Therefore, we suggest that we should continue with Witness TBC and Witness TAS today." So we moved from Witness TAS to Witness TBC. And it was only after TBC that TAS came to testify. I am referring to the transcript of Tuesday the 5th of August, this is page 2, paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. "I am hoping that Witness TAP's health should improve and then we can hear this." So, I just wanted to bring this change to the attention of the Trial Chamber. And these were changes that were beyond our -- we take due note of what the Prosecutor said. And the Prosecutor then proceeded with his re-examination. Madam President, I am -- on several occasions I have made -- I have protested, you will remember Witness TBI and TBJ, and you'll remember what I said on those occasions. And so I believe that the Prosecutor should apply the same rules. What applies to the goose, applies to the gander. And he should implement -- in fact, apply to himself what he applies to others.</p>

I always had the courtesy of informing the Court of any variation and sought the Court's indulgence; Counsel, this morning did not. He just informed us that he would be calling YEW, when it was YCW who was listed.And if Your Honours recollect, on every occasion when there was a variation of the order of witnesses, the Chamber granted Counsel short breaks to prepare for the cross-examination of those witnesses.

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, this week I am not in a position to tell the Trial Chamber who should be appearing exactly this week. I am expecting witnesses to arrive on Thursday. I was promised that these witnesses would arrive on Thursday. And I also believe, Madam President, I mentioned this this morning as a side line that most certainly -- but we are just trying to resolve this problem, we might actually reduce the number of witnesses that I had initially suggested, especially if it can allow us to avoid the problem of Rule 15 bis, that is my main concern, Madam President.If everyone were already available here, then I could give you the names of those who were to testify. But, as I am still working on my team to see if it is not possible for this section to block certain of those persons in view of the current situation, I believe that it might not be a bad thing, unless the parties do not agree or the Trial Chamber does not agree. That is our main concern, Madam President. We have asked, but we don't know. We said that while we were waiting for one of our expert witnesses to come and testify next week, but if that can be done, Madam President, I believe that things would move very quickly for us. Well, at least, so that we can respect the deadlines that we had set. Of course, if there are any problems that arrive, I would like you to know that it is not because we have not done our utmost. In any case, tomorrow the Trial Chamber will be sure of the fact that Witness YCW, I believe, will be testifying tomorrow. Thank you, Madam President.</p>

She told me that there had been killing in the locality and that the bourgmestre had come and asked the people to avoid anything that could be a threat to safety, and that the killings should stop because he did not want the killings to continue in his commune, and that the perpetrators of the killing had been arrested.</p>

            <p>You are relating that scene as if were you on the spot. But if I relate what I went through, I was hiding at home and I want to tell you that I didn't go to Nyakarambi after that date, so I cannot tell you what happened subsequently.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS YEW:</speaker>
            <p>I am referring to the 14th of April, in the morning. When I saw what had happened and when I recalled the protests I had seen, I was afraid and I didn't go back to Nyakarambi after that date. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-yew">
            <speaker>WITNESS YEW:</speaker>
            <p>No, there was no roadblock. I had my own problems. The fact that I was sheltering Tutsis and Hutus in my home, people who had sought refuge in my home, I had problems with my sister-in-law, who was a Tutsi, so you'd understand that I had problems myself. </p>

            <p>So, Witness, would it be evidence that between the 14th of April 1994 and when you fled on the 28th of April 1994, you stayed at home and didn't move about?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-yew">
            <speaker>WITNESS YEW:</speaker>
            <p>I stayed at home, as I've already explained to you. I had a sister-in-law who was a Tutsi and who was staying with me in my house, and there was another group of refugees who had sought refuge in my home. I told you that I was being threatened and people could come and loot my house so I stayed in my home until the time when I fled.</p>

Witness, from the evidence you've given both in-chief and cross-examination so far, you deny witnessing any killing of Tutsis; is that correct?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS YEW:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-yew">
            <speaker>WITNESS YEW:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I indeed made mention of his brother, who was a teacher. On the 13th of April, when I got to Nyakarambi where I was doing my business, that was in the morning, when I arrived there was no beer because there was a shortage of beer. So I was obliged to go to an area known as Kiyanzi to look for beer. When I got there, I met Oswald's brother, known as Hatungimana. We greeted each other and I asked him why he was there, and he told me that he was fleeing because his brother, Oswald, had told him that the bourgmestre had advised him to flee because the situation was becoming serious and criminals who had been jailed had been released and consequently he was not in a position to provide for our security. So he therefore advised me to flee, and the others also fled. And I wished him good luck. </p>

            <p>Madam President, the Chamber and all parties are facing Rule 15 bis. We would like to file another motion before the Chamber but we cannot do so without having accurate information from the witness protection section. And I believe if we had those details, we will do quite a few things and avoid using or relying on 15 bis and we would be able to do a lot of things. For now, we don't have the information we need. We don't know whether witnesses will be arriving this evening, and that is precisely why I'm not in a position to specify any further, Madam President. Madam President, with your permission -- I did not consult my notes -- I am not sure the list I gave was exact. I mentioned BK1, RDM, RDS. Madam President, I was saying that my motion had to do with Witness BK1, RDM and RDS. As to the question regarding the witnesses I have for the rest of the week, I say this morning I intend to call Witness YCW, and if we still have enough time I will call Witness UPT, who was announced yesterday. Yesterday it was not certain, but this morning, it is a certainty.</p>

            <p>Madam President, with regard to what counsel for the Prosecution has said, our objection is not in regard to the principle of the work done by the technician. The question we want to put to you is -- has to do with whether the witness will be testifying while the technician will be working. I don't think we have anything against the work of the technician, but since we are dealing with protected witnesses and the technician has not taken a solemn -- made a solemn declaration, we would wish that somebody else should work -- or should speak while the technician is doing his work and that it shouldn't be the protected witness who is testifying at that time. I'm suggesting, therefore, some kind of simulation. </p>

            <p>Very early in the morning, on the morning of the 12th, I was in my residence and I saw a conseiller go by my house. He was on his motorcycle. We thought that the conseiller was starting to move about that there was a lull in the situation. Subsequently, I saw a child go and get water and she said that criminals had attacked Kurunziza's house and the latter had killed the owner of the residence. We were surprised and feeling panicky, and we wondered how these criminals could have killed Kurunziza, this was in the morning around 7 a.m. I bathed and then I went to seek for information, to find out if he had really been killed. And so, I went to the secteur office around 8 a.m. When I reached the secteur office, the bourgmestre of the commune was there with policemen. I saw the inspector of the police judiciale, IPJ of our commune. They started to conduct an investigation into the events that had taken place in my secteur. During the course of their investigation, they were able to identify the persons who had killed Kurunziza, and they were able to arrest all the perpetrators of these killings. The following persons were arrested: Nkunzumwami, Augustin, who was also known under an alias Maréchal. He was assisted by a person named Bubingo, Ismael. There was a person named Habukubaho, as well as a person named Batege Nteziryayo, a person called Uwizeye, who had not continued in his career in the army. So this was on the 12th. These persons were rested on the 12th. They were interviewed by the bourgmestre and the inspector of the police judiciale. So they were asked how they had planned this murder, because this was something totally new in our secteur. A few moments later, a young woman came and said that her parents' residence had been attacked the day before, but that the people living in the house were able to flee. The young woman -- the young girl said that she did not know where her parents were at the moment she was speaking to us. The house belonged to Everiste Kamanzi. He was a teacher who lived in the same secteur as I did. They asked the young girl questions about the identity of the attackers, and she said that she was able to identify one Grégoire Havugimana amongst the attackers. They did everything they could to arrest Grégoire and he confessed. He was asked whether he had attacked Kamanzi's alone or in the company of others. Grégoire acknowledged that he was part of a group that was led by Augustin Nkunzumwami. He was also able to mention the names of other persons who had not been mentioned previously, including one Ntambara and a person named Munyaguruba. The last two persons were also arrested. They actually -- they were waiting around to find out if their names were going to be mentioned. So they were there. </p>

And their tracts had been distributed by Kasaru who resided in Kibungu and in those tracts, the populace was informed that the bourgmestre supported the Tutsis and it even said that the bourgmestre and the sous-préfet were Inkotanyi accomplices, and that it was the Inkotanyi who had killed the president of the republic, and they were going to kill those two accomplices, and then we became afraid.

            <p>Inasmuch as my residence was behind my shop, I left them demonstrating in the road, and I took my vehicle and I went home because I was afraid. I was afraid because when we were still at the secteur office, I had shown that I did not fully agree with the criminal acts that were being perpetrated, and that was the reason that drove me to leave and go to my residence and go home.</p>

            <p>Well, it depends on how fast you drive. You know a vehicle can run at 180 kilometres an hour, it depends on your speed. But if you drive at a normal speed, you can cover that distance in 15 to 20 minutes. </p>

            <p>No particular events occurred in my locality. On the 13th, I went to my place of work at Nyakarambi very early in the morning to see how the situation was, what the situation was. I arrived there at about 8:30 a.m. On my arrival at Nyakarambi, I met the local businessmen, we were in front of my shop, and we began talking and a few moments later we saw the bourgmestre coming from his residence, and he stopped and greeted us. And when he arrived there, the bandits, the hooligans began to shout: "Here is that cretin coming". In any case, the hooligans couldn't attack him because there were policemen around carrying rifles, but they came up to him and we had the impression that they were going to attack him, and we asked the bourgmestre: "Sir, why did you release those criminals?" And he answered me -- he answered us and said: "It wasn't I who released them. I don't even know what to do." So we asked him, "What are we going to do?" And he answered, "I think that in view of the prevailing situation, anybody, everybody should be ready to flee because you see these hooligans are determined. I personally can't do anything because I am not the one who released them, but it is the sous-préfet who released them, and you know, I am a subordinate to the sous-préfet and we asked him, "What are we going to do because the situation is getting worse and worse". There was there a businessman, a trader whose name was Paulo Murwashyaka. There was Mutabazi's son. There was Jovine and two other people. Having seen that the bourgmestre was undecided, unclear, he said, "I will go and see the situation". He went to the house used as a shop and we, for our part, we each went our own way. We dispersed and each one went our own way. As for me, I went into the house where I had my shop and I began talking with my elder brother. We were wondering what we were going to do and he told me, "You know, we better begin considering the possibility of fleeing because the situation is getting worse and worse". And we began to put out things together, packed our bags and we took the vehicle that was there. We loaded our luggage and a short while later, we saw Murwashyaka who was our neighbour, and he told us, "You know, personally, I see that the situation is difficult, is very serious since the bourgmestre himself is -- has lost hope and asked us to flee to the extent possible". He took his vehicle and he took his family, and there was also another businessman who was a neighbour whose name was Kayumba. He got into his vehicle and they drove off to Tanzania.</p>

            <p>Yes, I knew them, they were my neighbours. They were traders like me. There was one person known as Murwanashyaka, Théo; there was another person known as Oswald Rutagenda; there was another person Marie, I don't know her family name. There was a person named Murokole and whose nickname was Nepo. There were many other buildings within the compound. I believe that there were perhaps tenants, but it was impossible for me to know who those persons were because we didn't see them often.</p>

            <p>They were of different ethnic groups. There were Tutsis as well as Hutus. Oswald, for instance, was a Tutsi. Marie was a Tutsi. Nepo was Hutu. Murwanashyaka was of mixed parentage, since both of them were of different ethnic groups. His mother was a Tutsi and his father was Hutu. Nepo was Hutu. </p>

            <p>Yes. In 1994, starting on the 11th of April, refugees would come, and as they went everywhere, the refugees camped everywhere, and in Rwanteru, refugees arrived at the time and I saw them go through the centre where I had my shop, on their way to Rwanteru. So there were refugees in that place because I could see them going by and continued in that direction, but I was not able to go and see how the camp was.</p>

            <p>He did not put them in the vehicle that he generally used. There were two vehicles. There was a second vehicle in which the inspecteur de la police judiciaire was and it was another Toyota Stout, and there was another vehicle, a dual-cabin pickup.

They were the ones who were making the most noise. And I generally saw some of those criminals, so I didn't know all the members of the group but I knew some of the criminals. Some of them were young children who did not have anything to do or who would sometimes help people carry their bags.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. He took notes. I could see that he was taking notes, making notes. He left and promised me to come back. He came back and asked me questions, again making notes. He promised me that he might come again to ask me further questions, but I never saw him again.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ycw">
            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So it's your evidence, Witness, that on the three occasions you were interviewed by Defence investigators, at no point did you sign any statement? Am I correct? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ycw">
            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>
            <p>At no time did I sign my statement, because the investigator promised me he would come back and we -- it was planned that I should sign on his return.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it's also correct, Witness, to suggest that you are only able to recall the most recent interview because it's only six weeks ago, isn't it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ycw">
            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. That is the case. If I remember the date, it's because it was recent. Moreover, when I met him, something else happened that helps me to recall my meeting with the investigator. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it's equally true, Witness, that you can't recall the dates of the interviews -- the two interviews last year, because it's a long time ago, isn't it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ycw">
            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>
            <p>No. That is not the reason. The reason, in truth, is because I wasn't paying attention in order to be able to remember that date, and I did not take note of the day. I did not write it down, because if something has happened, even a long time ago, but you write the dates down somewhere, you can remember. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, in your evidence in-chief this morning, you told Their Lordships that you left your home at around 8 a.m. and went to your local secteur office; am I correct? On the 12th of April 1994. </p>

            <p>Witness, I will read from the second paragraph of your statement to the Defence investigator, recorded on the 2nd of September 2003, and I quote: "What happened in your area after the death of President Habyarimana's death?" </p>

            <p>Obviously people were worried and we heard on Radio Rwanda that everyone had to stay home. They were some attacks some days later. Criminals launched and attack on the house of a teacher Everiste Kamanzi at Gatore and stole his motorcycle and clothes. The same night they attacked Kurunziza's house and killed him along with his family members. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Clearly, Witness, this answer is consistent with the question recorded in your statement and no suggestion is given as to the exact dates you have given us; isn't it?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ycw">
            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>
            <p>What I am saying is that I was answering questions put to me by the investigator and that I also gave him information regarding the dates of events which we were referring to. I said that I gave all the information that was expected of me.</p>

            <p>As regards Benard's death, I will tell you that I was not aware when he was killed, when he died. I saw his junior brother fleeing, accompanied by a certain Murwanashyaka Paul.

            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel for the Prosecution, I learnt of it like any other member of the population. I learnt about it later. Consequently, I cannot tell you that he was killed on such and such a day. I heard people talking about his death, but I cannot say that I witnessed his death or any other event relating to that individual. So, I therefore cannot talk about events I did not witness. I cannot tell you about the circumstances of his death because I did not witness his death.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS YCW:</speaker>
            <p>With regard to Kurunziza's death, that event was related to me, but as far as he was concerned, as far as I am concerned I saw his body because I went to his home. We left the secteur office and we went to his house to see what had happened since Kurunziza was a colleague and we belonged to the same religion. So we hurried up to go and help the family to bury Kurunziza's remains.</p>

            <p>That is not the reason preventing me from going back to Rwanda. I have already told you the reason why I am not going back to Rwanda, and I believe it is a valid reason. I told you that I will not go back to Rwanda in view of the situation -- what the authorities did to me. I was a member of a large family, but it seems that at the moment there are only two of us left, two members of my family left, and all of this is due to the authorities -- what the authorities did in the country, and it is not because I am afraid of being arrested by the Office of the Prosecutor in Kibugo.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I propose that the Chamber should allow me to call the next witness tomorrow morning if this does pose any particular problems. And, Madam President, as I pointed out earlier with regard to Rule 15, if tomorrow the Chamber is of the opinion that it is not possible, I will call that witness on Monday, Madam President. That would not pose any problem with regard to the deadline given to us because we are committed to abiding by the deadline set, and if at all it were not possible for us to do so, we will inform the Chamber accordingly. That is what I said and I stand by that statement.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, we object to Counsel's proposal on two grounds. We are operating on a very tight -- or against tight constraints because we have only five days within which we can proceed in the absence of a third Judge. Now if we blow this afternoon, it may create complications in calculating what is meant by a day. Today is Thursday, we close business now, we lose the afternoon. Are we able to recoup the other half of the day or not? The wording of the -- of the Rule 15bis <stage>(A)</stage> is five working days. We submit that if we stop at this stage and not resume this afternoon, we would have lost the outstanding hours in this working day. The other basis of our objection, Your Honours, is that, the Office of the Prosecutor is holding a training workshop on Friday and Saturday and it was anticipated that all three Chambers, the Trial Chambers will be used from 9 am up to 5:30 on Friday and Saturday for the training exercise. So if we adjourn this matter to tomorrow, Your Honours, it disrupts a European Union Financed training programme that has brought into Arusha trainers from Europe and the Pacific.Simply put, Your Honours, we believe since Witness UPT is in town, there's no reason why we should not depose of her evidence today and conclude three days of very good and brisk business so that the remaining two days can be utilised next week. Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>I want to add simply, Madame President, that we, the Defence of Gacumbitsi, have not had 24 hours of work. We didn't work on Tuesday because it was a public holiday. If the Chamber, during tendering of evidence, between the 8th and 18th of August, would notice that there was no hearing without the Prosecution objecting. I would like to state that Gacumbitsi's Defence Counsel is doing everything to speed up, to expedite proceedings and that is what I am telling the Chamber, and I have always said it. I thought that yesterday -- and you saw that when we were talking yesterday,Madam President, I said that I hadn't yet seen the witness. It was my assistant who was telling me he would arrive on such and such a day. If, Madam President, there's a meeting organised by the European Union or United Nations on Friday, no problem is posed. The problem that we are facing today and which concerns Defence has to do with Rule 15, and it refers to five working days. Everybody is aware of that. We -- up to now we have had only three days of hearings. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and I want to point out that we have two other days that we want to use as judiciously as possible in order to meet the deadlines set for us. I don't believe the time which is very very precious to all of us has been badly utilised, but as far as we are concerned, Madam President, we have not asked for any leave or any rebate of time in the tendering of our evidence -- of our Defence evidence.</p>

This would be convenient for everyone because if the Honourable Judges and the lawyers are there, it would pause a problem, but I believe the technician only needs to have somebody talk into the microphone instead of the stenographers being present in order to do the adjustments.</p>

The witness support -- the Witness and Victims Support Section for the Defence intends to bring five witnesses to Arusha that bear the following pseudonyms, NG2, NG4, RDR, MQ1 and MQ4. These are five factual witnesses that shall be available to testify in the week that begins on the 20th of October up to the 23rd of October.With respect to the last two factual witnesses for the Gacumbitsi case, these two persons had been repatriated from one country to another. This is a voluntary repatriation, and it should be mentioned that these two persons do not yet have identity cards, and the identity cards are used as a basis to issue travel documents allowing these persons to travel to Arusha. At the present state <stage>(sic),</stage> the section cannot guarantee that these persons shall be present before the end of the month. We have undertaken the necessary measures so that their identity cards will be issued.As to the three expert witnesses in the Gacumbitsi defence case, the travel of one of the expert witnesses, Mr. Ndengejeho has been scheduled for next week. For the other two expert witnesses dealing with forensic matters, we would like to inform the Trial Chamber that the ministry of foreign affairs of the French republic has agreed to make the two high-ranking civil servants -- to make them available to the Tribunal. Therefore, the registry has sent them a contract dated as of the 7th of October. We are still waiting to be communicated their travel plans that will be communicated to us by the Defence team, and that will allow us to organise the travel plans of these two witnesses.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honour. I have two issues arising out of the WVSS submission. Now, it's my understanding that WVSS is bringing five factual witnesses next week; namely, NG2, MG4, RDR, MQ1 and MQ4. In addition, I also understood that arrangements had been made for the expert witness Ndengejeho to be here next week. Now, if that's correct, Your Honours, there may not be sufficient time in two working days to go through the evidence of five factual witnesses and an expert witness.The last time Professor Ndengejeho was here, in the Semanza trial, his testimony took a whole week, so it may not be prudent to fly this expert here next week because it's unlikely that we would be able to go through his evidence in addition to the five factual witnesses.The other point, Your Honours, is that WVSS has gone ahead to arrange the attendance of Witness MQ4, who was not listed by the Defence in accordance with your scheduling order made under 73ter. As such, this witness remains unlisted and cannot properly appear before Your Honours unless the Defence files a motion to vary its witness list. That's all I have to say for the time being, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. With respect to expert witness Ndengejeho, we have been in close contact with the Defence team and it is supposed to tender a report written by Mr. Ndengejeho before the Trial Chamber. And we understand that this report needs to be filed 21 days before the expert witness can testify. And this is why we felt it was appropriate, and this of course in close consultation with the Defence team, to bring him in as of next week so that he can begin to testify in the period of the -- beginning on the 27th of October, and this will allow us to comply with the 21 days required for the filing of the expert report.As to the other experts, the forensic experts, no dates have yet been set, and it is the Defence team's responsibility to provide clarification on this matter. As to Witness MQ4, our section only provides support, and our job is to bring witnesses appearing on a list that is given to us by a defence team; therefore, it is up to the Defence team to ensure communication of the names of the witnesses to the other party, and our section only deals with transporting the witnesses to Arusha at a request made by the Defence. It is not our responsibility to verify, for example, if one of the witnesses whose name has been communicated -- or whose pseudonym has been communicated is on the final list of witnesses that has been forwarded to the Office of the Prosecutor. I thank you.</p>

            <p>Yes, thank you. Counsel Kouengoua, can you answer the Prosecutor with respect to your witnesses and, more specifically, with respect to Witness MQ4 and the expert witness?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I thank you, Madam President, Your Honour.As far as Witness M4 -- or rather, MQ4, Madam President, we have submitted the name and statement by this witness to the Office of the Prosecutor. And until this very specific point in time, we have not received any objects <stage>(sic)</stage> or comments in this regard. And, Madam President, we were preparing to file a motion in this regard but, before that, we needed to know whether the other party had no objection to raise with respect to the name and the statement of the witness that was communicated to the Office of the Prosecutor. They did not do so.But that is not the issue, Madam President. As far as the Defence is concerned, we have always tried to work in an atmosphere of clarity, and I never thought that a witness, such as MQ4, or other witnesses would be endlessly debated here in the courtroom because even those who were disclosed on the list we are currently withdrawing them from the list of witnesses, as we have stated, in order to harmonise our defence with the whole Trial Chamber and, of course, with the Office of the Prosecutor.Therefore, Madam President, if what the Prosecutor is now stating -- that he does not agree with this witness coming to testify and with the statement made by this witness -- that's another issue. But we gave the name, and we had to file a motion before your Trial Chamber in this regard. Moreover, Madam President, I also believe that the Office of the Prosecutor did not to react to this communication because he knows perfectly well that many of our witnesses were contacted in September for the hearing of the 6th of October, and I believe everyone is aware of this.Now, Madam President, with respect to the expert witness, once again, I am dealing with a situation as it is. Mr. Ndengejeho testified during two weeks. This is information that I cannot confirm or deny, but if Semanza perhaps lasted two years <stage>(sic),</stage> my trial -- case will be presented between the 6th to the 31st of October; therefore, I did not intend to ask for the two weeks you used previously. To say that 31st of October is too short with what I am expected to do, that is not what is being discussed here. We are in a Tribunal where the situation has changed, and we must do our best to adapt to the situation. If the expert witness -- if the professor tells the Trial Chamber or the Defence that in less than a week -- in less than five days, he cannot testify, that is another matter, but I don't think that is the case. But if we need three weeks for him to testify, taking into consideration examination-in-chief and cross-examination, this is information sent by the Office of the Prosecutor that the Trial Chamber will have to take into consideration. The Prosecutor is of the view that perhaps the expert witness might require additional days, and we don't see how we can oppose ourselves to it. He is the one who needs time for his cross-examination, Madam President; but, as stated by the representative of the witness support section, we are of the opinion that if the witness arrived in Arusha during next week, he could testify beginning on the 26th or the 27th. It's just that we do not know that there would be difficulties with respect to examination or cross-examination.And we stated that if certain witnesses were going to be withdrawn in order to take into consideration certain facts, there is no obstacle, there is no reason for the Defence not to consider this hypothesis, and this, Madam President, is our position.Madam President, with respect to the French experts, we have some difficulties. Even during the break I attempted to speak with the Institute Medico-Legal in Paris, the forensic institute in Paris. I left messages and I am waiting for answers. I think that we have really shown due diligence. We hope that everything will take place smoothly, but to as the expresses concerned <stage>(sic),</stage> the registry had given them two weeks as of the time of their appointment, which would be as of the 11th of September, I believe, or a date somewhere in that vicinity; as of the 6th of October, actually. And so those are the nuances that needed to be brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber. So, Madam President, what I was saying this morning has now been confirmed. For example, at the present stage we have only one witness in Arusha, and this is not because of any fault of the Defence, Madam President; these are just situations that we sometimes have to face.</p>

            <p>We thank you, Counsel; nevertheless, I believe it is time for you to decide which witnesses you wish to withdraw in order for you to file a motion in this regard. Moveover, with respect to Witness MQ4, which you seek to add to your list, it is now time for you to file those motions. And with respect to expert witness Ndengejeho, it would be good to know how long will be needed to hear this expert because we have time constraints that we have to deal with. You know that we cannot sit, in theory, beyond the 31st of October, and we need to resolve all of these problems in order to see what is possible.If there are no further questions that need to be raised to the representative of the witness support section, then we will thank her and we will tell her that she may now leave.Counsel Kouengoua, please file your motion as quickly as possible -- as soon as possible. Now we shall ask you to call in your witness.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, the witness list is a matter regulated by Rule 73 ter. It is a standard requirement with fixed deadlines set by the Chamber in a scheduling ordering. Now, this Chamber gave a scheduling order, and a list containing the names and pseudonyms of 26 witnesses, signed by co-counsel Mbattang, on the 14th of September 2003, was filed with the Chamber. Now, it goes without saying, Your Honours, that this is the only list properly before this Chamber. And this is why, again, Rule 73 ter provides for the procedure to be followed should there be a variation or should counsel seek a variation of that listed. In this case, counsel has not filed the relevant motion seeking leave of the Chamber to vary this list, and therefore, any purported disclosure of that -- of the statement of MQ4 does not cure this fundamental defect.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>It's difficult, Your Honours, at this stage to say whether or not we will be able to finish these witnesses 'cause it is all dependent upon the counsel for the Defence who is leading these witnesses in-chief. However, Your Honours, the Prosecutor takes a contrary view and would propose that for the better utilisation of the two outstanding trial days under 15bis and for optimum utilisation of this limited time, rather than start late today, we propose that we adjourn and have a full day Tuesday and Wednesday.Now, this leads me, Your Honours, to the second point. We were given a list of six factual witnesses, and on cross-checking counsel's witness list, it appears that these are the remaining factual witnesses; i.e., if these six witnesses are heard, that would only leave the experts and the Accused. Now, if counsel could advise us when the other two listed witnesses could be here, then we would plan to dispose of all six witnesses in the two outstanding trial days we have. So if, for example, the two witnesses not present in Arusha were arriving tonight or tomorrow, we would be able to dispose of all factual witnesses in the two days, rather than using two days to dispose of just four witnesses.And I'd just like to submit, Your Honours, that our submission is made in good faith, in the interests of justice, and we are merely being pro-active in planning for the optimum utilisation of the two working days we have outstanding. Most obliged, Your Honours. </p>

            <p>We thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.Counsel Kouengoua, how do you feel about the proposition that has been made by the Office of the Prosecutor? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, the suggestion that has been made by the Office of the Prosecutor is a suggestion that meets the five working days. I have no specific objections to raise. But as to the two other witnesses concerned, they have not yet arrived, and if we were to comply with the suggestion made by the Prosecutor as we understood it, we believe that, in provision of the witnesses arriving, that we could use this afternoon because that way -- sorry. Yes, of course, this would cause -- raise another problem. Would the two working days begin the first and the second, or is it a 24-hour basis? If we consider that a working day is over 24 hours, then we could begin this afternoon; but of course, if it's one and two, then, of course, it's not possible. So if that were the case, then the suggestion made by the Office of the Prosecutor is better than ours -- is perhaps better than ours.The other difficulty that arises from this, Madam President, is that we might end up in a similar situation, because if the two other witnesses do not arrive today or tomorrow morning, then we could end up facing a similar problem, so I honestly don't know what is best. We thought that, as Defence counsel, we could hear all four witnesses today, but if the suggestion raised by the Prosecutor is correct, then that would cause problems, because we are entitled to two more working days but not to 48 hours, perhaps. If we count by day rather than by 24 hours, 24 hours plus 24 hours is 48 hours, instead of one day plus one day which is two days. I mean, otherwise, we could consider other possible combinations.In any case, Madam President, this is truly a delicate situation, and our suggestion to begin this afternoon was done, as the Prosecutor said, in good faith. But of course, we had never considered this other way of seeing things. Thank you, Madam President. </p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, but the Prosecutor is also asking you if the two other witnesses, plus the four witnesses that are here today, are all of the factual witnesses that you wish to bring and that you have no other witnesses; and aside from these six factual witnesses, there are no other persons to testify with the exception of the Accused and the expert witnesses. You only have six witnesses remaining; is that correct?</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Well, Madam President, taking into consideration Rule 15, I think we can indeed look in this direction. I mean, taking into consideration Rule 15 and the difficulties that the Trial Chamber has to face, because we had stated publicly before the Trial Chamber that we would -- that we intended to file motions, but if it were going to cause any problems, then I think that perhaps we need to look into that direction.

            <p>If I may just add, Your Honours, that the witness list has nothing to do with the 15bis. The proposition of the Prosecutor was that, having looked at the list, the number of witnesses led so far and the number of witnesses who have been brought, counsel only has six outstanding factual witnesses, and he has avoided answering that.The other point, Your Honours, is that maybe it would be appropriate to call the WVSSD representative into the Chamber to advise us on the estimated travel dates of the two other witnesses so that, you know, we can plan on the basis of information available rather than just speculating as to when they will arrive. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I believe that it is necessary for us to have a representative from WVSS. Perhaps you could call her to find out whether the two other factual witnesses will be coming to -- will be arriving in Arusha, and this will allow us to make our decision with a full knowledge of the facts.We are going to take advantage of this time available to us to render our decision with respect to the motion filed by the Defence with respect to Exhibit D. 04.During the hearing of the 26th of August, 2003, and during the cross-examination of Prosecution expert witness Alison Des Forges, notified the Trial Chamber requesting that a document, recorded temporarily under Exhibit D. 04, be admitted as an exhibit. This document is composed of four subdocuments. One of them is a letter from François Fena <stage>(phonetic)</stage> who was the chef de cabinet of the UNHCR; a summary of a presentation done on the 10th of October, 1994, by the UNHCR before a commission of experts with respect to the possibilities of rapid repatriation of Rwandan refugees currently in Burundi, Tanzania, and Zaire; a report of the local UNHCR mission, as of the 14th and 15th May, 1994, about security and several crossing points with the Rwandan border; and finally, a document without a title that is also alleged to be a report of the local UNHCR mission, which is a status report of the security situation based on interviews of refugees.Subsequently, the Trial Chamber invited the Defence, if it could, to tender a complete version of the various documents that have been mentioned and a more legible copy. As the Defence was not able to comply, the Trial Chamber now orders the following with respect to the admission of this document as an exhibit: The Trial Chamber grants the Defence's request that the above-mentioned document be admitted as a Defence exhibit under exhibit number D. 04. In view of the fact that the document is not complete and is only partially legible, the Trial Chamber is of the view that they shall appreciate the contents of said documents subsequently. Indeed, we have received a second document which is very similar to the previous document, and the Prosecutor had not objected to the admission of said document as an exhibit, as a Defence exhibit.</p>

As to the factual witnesses, we have brought four witnesses instead of the five scheduled witnesses, because at the last minute the Defence team asked us to delay the arrival of Witness MQ4, which is why the following witnesses are here: NG2, NG4, RDR, and MQ1. As to the expert witness Professor Ndengejeho, we are trying to bring him in this week, but our colleagues who are in charge of the travel team are facing various difficulties in connecting his flights to Arusha. And so if these matters can be resolved, Mr. Ndengejeho will arrive approximately on the 23rd of October. Thank you, Madam President. </p>

            <p>I will repeat the pseudonyms, Your Honours. The six witnesses listed for this week are NG4, NG2, RDR, MQ1, XW13, XW15. WVSS confirms the presentation in Arusha of the first four on the list. No mention has been made regarding the last two, that is, Witness XW13, XW15. Instead, reference was made to MQ4, who is not listed and in respect of whom no motion has been filed under 73ter, and the expert Professor Ndengejeho reportedly arriving on the 23rd of October.Now, with regard to the last two, MQ4 and Ndengejeho, there is no need to have them in Arusha at all, first because MQ4 is not on the list, and second because there's no likelihood that Professor Ndengejeho will be testifying. That can only happen subsequent to the third Judge being available and a hearing date being fixed.What we need to know, Your Honours, is what arrangements have been put in place to procure the attendance this week of XW13 and XW15.

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. We remember that on the hearing of the 16th of October, 2003, the WVSSD had informed the Trial Chamber that witnesses XW13 and XW15 could not come to Arusha until after the 31st of October because these two persons were voluntarily repatriated to their current country of residence, and these two persons did not have national identity cards, and we had undertaken the necessary measures so that these documents could be issued but -- that these persons do not currently have available to them. Therefore, it is virtually impossible for us to make these witnesses travel as no travel documents can be issued if they are not in possession of a national identity card. Thank you, Madam President. </p>

Therefore, do you wish to introduce a motion with respect to these two witnesses? Moreover, with respect to expert witness Ndengejeho, it would be better, perhaps, to delay his appearance until after the 31st of October when Judge Reddy will have returned, because we cannot sit pursuant to Rule 15bis.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I thank you, Madam President. With respect to factual witnesses XW13 and XW15, Madam President, those two witnesses are part of those for whom I had informed the Trial Chamber that they had disappeared. I believe that's the word that I had used and that had been -- we discussed. The witness support section was able to locate XW1, who has already come to testify, and has also located XW13 and XW15. And these witnesses are on the list that we filed on the 14th of September, and therefore, they are part of our initial list of witnesses and have not been either dismissed or cancelled at this stage.Therefore, Madam President, the Defence is basically hoping that the witness support section will be able to bring those two witnesses to testify. Their testimony is very important for the defence, Madam President.With respect to Professor Ndengejeho, what the Defence is currently doing is to make everything possible available in order to meet the prescribed deadlines. If Ndengejeho cannot testify because of the absence of one of the Judges, which this is quite obvious, Madam President, I feel that it is up to the Trial Chamber to make the appropriate orders. What the Defence is doing, and what we have always done, is to -- or hope is that as of the 31st of October, 2003, we will have completed our case, but we have all these other problems to deal with, and they are not our fault. What we have stated is that there are four witnesses in Arusha, and that we are prepared to bring those witnesses in, and we are prepared to hear them in two days or 48 hours, I'm not quite sure what term is best. But the Trial Chamber needs to be informed of the fact that it isn't just Professor Pascal Ndengejeho, but there is also Professor Dominique Lecomte and Professor Vorhaouer, and these are experts that are based in France. And we have put in requests and their contracts have been signed, and I would therefore like -- I would like to ensure that we do not forget to include the names of these two experts in the present discussions.The Defence would like to see that these difficulties that we face -- so the Prosecutor could assist us. We didn't know. We asked that Professor Ndengejeho could come and testify as of Monday the 27th, for example. We thought that it could be done, but now if the Judge who is not here cannot be here, then in that case, Madam President, perhaps the section -- the witness support section will be advised and take appropriate measures. But in any case, in good faith, in all humility, we are hoping to finish as of the 31st. This is what we were expecting.These problems are not our fault, and as to the problem with respect to Ndengejeho, we have just heard this information now at the same time as everyone else. We did not know that the Judge would not be back as of the 27th. We thank you, Madam President. </p>

            <p>Thank you. Counsel's calculation is erroneous. We had three days of hearing last week, which means technically we have two days left. Even in our submissions yesterday we made reference to the fact that we had two days left and we sought that the hearing continues both today, Tuesday, and tomorrow, Wednesday. Now, if Counsel is including yesterday's session, Your Honours, we submit that that wasn't a hearing within the provisions of Rule 15bis <stage>(A),</stage> but rather it was a session clearly provided for under Rule 15bis paragraph <stage>(b)</stage>
              <stage>(ii)</stage>
              <stage>(a),</stage> i.e., Your Lordships were in session to dispose of the applications for an adjournment, which did not constitute -- or which do not constitute a hearing within the provisions of 15A. We submit that hearing refers to hearing testimony of witnesses, be they Defence or Prosecution. Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Madam President, Counsel for the Prosecution's argument does not differ very much from his argument yesterday. However, one is forced to observe that this argument is no longer valid because the Trial Chamber did hold a hearing yesterday in the matter of the Prosecution versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. The Trial Chamber held a hearing in the presence of the Accused and all the parties. The Trial Chamber held a hearing during which all the Defence witnesses due to appear were named. The Trial Chamber held a hearing in the course of which a decision was rendered. Now, Article 15 talks of five working days. Yesterday we felt that the Prosecution was in good faith, but that led everyone into error. We cannot consider that yesterday was not a day of hearing in the matter, the Prosecution versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. We cannot ignore the fact or discard the fact that the names of factual witnesses and expert witnesses were named and a decision handed down in order to have a better knowledge of the facts in the matter, and the Trial Chamber invited the person in charge in the witness and victims services section. If we followed that argument, the question put to you would be what were you doing yesterday in the hearing, what case you were working on? If it was to dispense with administrative matters, did you need to call the Accused -- summon the Accused? Why did you also deal with all those other matters? Madam, time is moving. It is already nine o'clock. Let us call the four witnesses so that everyone can respect the legality of the procedure before the Chamber. Yesterday I wanted to hear two of the witnesses. The Prosecutor made a mistake and we all followed in error. What does it matter today? It is still early. Let us proceed with hearing the witnesses. It is better to hear them than not to hear them, and if we don't do so, we will no longer be respecting the five working days time limit, and what the Counsel for the Prosecution has always had as a major concern is the economy of justice within the Tribunal. Can we bring these witnesses back, send them home to bring them back? No, I think we should take -- grab the bull by the horns and hear the witnesses today. Even if we have to work until midnight, we wouldn't be breaking the -- we wouldn't be in violation of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. </p>

            <p>Very briefly, Your Honours, with your leave. All I want to underscore is that there is a difference between Rule 15bis <stage>(A)</stage> and Rule 15bis <stage>(B)</stage> and counsel has just referred to Rule 15bis without laying the basis upon which his submission is made. Just to reiterate my earlier submission, Your Honours, to put yesterday's hearing in its proper context under Rule 15bis <stage>(B),</stage> we submit that when the Court sat yesterday, the question was whether we should proceed with the hearing or not. Counsel wanted to proceed, and I objected. At the end of the day the session was adjourned to today. Basically, what we are submitting, Your Honours, is that yesterday was not a hearing within Rule 15bis <stage>(A),</stage> but rather it was a session during which you adjourned the hearing under Rule 15bis <stage>(B)</stage>
              <stage>(ii)</stage> para. <stage>(a),</stage> and counsel should not bog us down by submissions that are not based on any known rule. Most obliged. </p>

            <p>We thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. Listen, please, if we go on like that we're going to waste a lot of time. You yourself pointed that out, Counsel for the Defence. I think we can now deliberate and tell you what our ruling will be. Yesterday we all thought that we could sit today and tomorrow on the basis of 15bis. According to CMS, Court Management Section, yesterday is considered as a day of hearing. There can be interpretations; the proof of the pudding is that Counsel for the Defence and Counsel for the Prosecution do not have the same position. So as not to expose ourselves to a -- grounds for appeal, we prefer to sit all day, try and hear the four Defence witnesses while requesting, of course, Defence to proceed expeditiously and deal especially with essentials, and we shall ask Counsel for the Prosecution to do their utmost to help us here with the four witnesses. As things stand, we cannot say either the one or the other is right. There is -- there are -- it is subject to interpretation. Let us at least avoid falling into a trap, and without further ado let us tackle the first witness, and we shall sit with small breaks in order to do all that is necessary in hearing the four witnesses due to be heard today. If that is agreeable to you, let us proceed forthwith with the first witness. Counsel Kouengoua, please call your first witness. </p>

But this document remains confidential, a document that would be shown to the witness, so only the witness and the parties and the Bench see the document.

We respected those instructions; we complied with those instructions. The Tuesday of the week following the week when the president's plane was shot down, a man came from the place called Gatore, and he said that there was a man by the name of Karuyonza <stage>(phonetic),</stage> who had been called, so the Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi came to hold a meeting to deliberate on security problems, questions of public safety, and the man who came with information took part in the meeting.

He was frightened and he left running, or he ran away, rather, and abandoned the bicycle behind. I found this -- I was informed of this subsequently, and I followed the road that he had taken to try and find the bicycle. I found the bicycle at his neighbours.

Clearly, this witness, Your Honours, has said he was in hiding, he never saw the Accused at all, he was at his home. Of what relevance is, is, is -- you know, the evidence of hearsay, in light of the fact that he has, by his own admission, conceded he never saw the Accused, never witnessed any incitement? Why should we suffer -- continue suffering his presence here, Your Honours, given the time constraints we have, Rule 89C aside? </p>

            <p>As a matter of fact, I learnt of his assassination on the night of the 6th of April, and it was announced by RTLM Radio at about 8 p.m. The announcement said that the president's plane had been shot down. At about 10 p.m., it was said that the president had been assassinated. Subsequently, the next day, news was still being announced.

            <p>On the 8th of April, as a matter of fact, I would rather start with the 7th. At night the inhabitants of Kigama <stage>(phonetic),</stage> a neighbouring commune, started torching houses; and we observed that on the 8th. My parents asked me to go and visit my maternal aunt. On my way, I saw a group of people. I went to look closely and Gacumbitsi met me there. To sum up what I am saying, I would say that in my area nothing special happened on the 9th. The inhabitants of Kig -- Gitarama commune launched an attack. They killed one person and looted his cattle. We asked for help and were able to recover all the cows that had been looted. On that same day, that is the 9th, we saw refugees coming from Birenga commune and passing through Rukira commune on their way to Rusumo in order to cross the border into Tanzania. </p>

            <p>On the 10th of April nothing happened, apart from the fact that the refugees continued to flee. Even up to the 12th, refugees were moving about looking for refuge. On the 12th, the inhabitants of Rukira commune launched an attack against the parish. The people who had sought refuge in the church continued fleeing. Some of these people were killed. In our commune, Rukira, many people were killed, and people who were now living next to the communal office fled into Rusumo commune. I am referring to the events that occurred on the 13th of April. </p>

            <p>On the 14th, as had been the case in Rukira communal office, the attackers continued to pursue the survivors who had fled. The assailants went to flush them out where they had sought refuge, and when they got to Birenga on their way to Nyarutunga, the refugees who were on Rutunga hill saw the attackers coming and they thought they were going to attack them once again, and the attackers started firing at the refugees.

The two gendarmes who were leading the group spoke with people, but I didn't hear what they were saying. But all of a sudden, I heard them open fire and I saw somebody collapse, and they were able to capture two people, whom they tied up. After that we left.

            <p>On the 15th, people came from Rukira and forced members of the population to arm themselves. They were put on board a vehicle and led towards an area called Nyarubuye. As we drew close to Nyarubuye at the level of the dispensary, we came out of the vehicle, but before we got there the -- all the people we met were forced to accompany us on foot to get to Nyarubuye. Once we got to the health centre, the vehicles that had brought us there left, went back and brought back other people. When we got out of the vehicle we were asked to move in the direction of Nyarubuye. When we got to Nyarubuye, we were ordered to encircle the parish so that nobody could escape from the parish premises from inside the parish. </p>

            <p>Yes. We were ordered to encircle the parish so that nobody could get out of the parish. As a matter of fact, at that time the attackers were ordered to wear banana leaves or leaves in general. As far as I am concerned, I was close to the entrance and I heard the lieutenant say, "Those who are innocent should get out of there." And at that time roughly four or five people came out of the building.</p>

            <p>From Mulindi to Nyarubuye? First of all, you can get there by road or you can take a shortcut. When you take the main road, it is about six kilometres, but if you take a shortcut across the hills, it is more <stage>(sic)</stage> than six kilometres. </p>

            <p>The lieutenant ordered those in the centre to come out. Four or five people came out, and the refugees started hurling spears and arrows at the attackers, and the attackers, in turn, opened fire on the refugees, and those who were inside the building started shouting. The attackers did the same, and some of the attackers were saying that, "You shouldn't shoot at the refugees. Allow us to get into the building and bring out some members of our families." There were children in the building, but the gendarmes continued to shoot at the refugees. There was gunfire, and grenades were exploding. And after that the attackers were ordered to enter the building and collect some property. At that time, some of the property was transported on the vehicles that the gendarmes had travelled in, as well as other people. And during this mad rush a vehicle belonging to the parish, which was a Suzuki, was also looted.</p>

            <p>I should like the Prosecution to change the line of questioning. This is the third question put. He's never said he was put in prison. He never said he was in Rusumo on the 8th. These are questions asked that have nothing to do with what happened. The way the question is being asked, the witness is forced to answer, no.

            <p>No, I was not present, but the answer -- the information is given to me by the prisoners from my area who were present in the course of attack and who told me that the communal office had been attacked and the prisoners had escaped and people had been killed in the course of that attack.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>I did not wear a weapon. I only went there so as not to meet the same fate as someone who was killed on the pretext he was an Inkotanyi accomplice.</p>

            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, someone called lieutenant who asked those inside -- addressed those inside, saying that the innocent should come out.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>To my knowledge, they had committed no crime. It is perhaps the gendarme who knew what crimes they had committed because they were the ones who planned the attack.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>No, I was never implicated -- involved in planning the attack because all the people who came to Nyarubuye had been forced to follow the gendarme -- had been forced by the gendarme to follow the gendarme.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>But you weren't <stage>(inaudible,)</stage> were you, Witness, because one of the gendarmes had even given you permission not to wear banana leaves that day?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>I was afraid even if I didn't wear banana leaves. Imagine for the first time, firing and explosions. It is frightening, it is fearsome.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Why is it that you alone were excused from wearing banana leaves when all of the other attackers wore them? What special relationship did you have with the people that planned this massacre?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>I told you that people were ordered to wear banana leaves. I didn't wear any. That is not to say that everybody wore banana leaves. There were others that didn't wear them, but since I was very close to the gendarme and they were my neighbours in Mulindi, I did not wear banana leaves.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>So not only were you given special permission not to wear banana leaves, Witness, but you didn't have a weapon either, did you?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I did not wear a weapon. You know, the people were ordered to wear banana leaves as a way of frightening people, but when you look at it closely, it wasn't really a problem because banana leaves are not a weapon, but, rather, a way of frightening people. And the gendarme were leading the attack, and when they ordered people to wear banana leaves they couldn't refuse, but nonetheless if someone asked them permission not to wear the banana leaves, they were given permission not to.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>So, you would have us believe that in the middle of this extremely threatening situation, you had the liberty to turn to a gendarme and say, "I don't want to wear banana leaves. Please don't let me wear banana leaves", when you were in the front row of the attack. Is that what you want us to believe, Witness?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>No, I told you the gendarme found us in Mulindi and forcibly led us, and I told you that I worked very near where they were based, so I don't think it's a problem to tell them that I do not wish to wear banana leaves.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Witness, you've told us you were forced to loot from the corpses. What did you personally loot?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>We were asked to go into the parish enclosure to loot everything that was there and put it in the gendarme's vehicle.</p>

          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>Personally, I did not take anything from the corpses of the victims. I did not walk away with anything. I did not leave with anything.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-mobberley">
            <speaker>MS. MOBBERLEY:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, you've told us you were terrified and that you were forced to loot. Are you now telling us that you weren't under any duress and that you could freely walk away and not loot? Did you have that choice?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>I told you that we were forced to enter the parish enclosure to pillage. We were forced. We went into the enclosure, but the fact of entering the enclosure doesn't mean that one should necessarily leave with anything. However, some people looted property, put it in the gendarme vehicle. They took bags belonging to victims or furniture from the church, but I personally did not take anything.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-ng2">
            <speaker>WITNESS NG2:</speaker>
            <p>I would say that the looting, pillaging, approximately -- but I can't really make an estimate because I immediately left because I didn't stay with the others. I went home well before the gendarme, so I cannot give you an estimation.</p>

            <p>Madam President, they said, "You are eluding the question, but you will -- should answer." That is not a question, that is a comment. The witness has answered it on several occasions, but we have other witnesses to get through. It was a comment from the Counsel from the Prosecution.</p>

            <p>Well, there might be a problem with the translation, but what I understood from Counsel for Prosecution was that the question was not being answered, and they want the witness to answer the question more directly. But there's no need to argue about that; I think we can continue.</p>

It has happened before.I should rather not that this occur again, so I very respectfully pray the Bench to tell me what I should do with these various witnesses.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, indeed Judge Reddy will only be back here by the end of the month, on the 31st, in principle.As regards the witnesses, there are no further witnesses on the spot since WVSS tells us that they are processing the papers in respect of those witnesses, so they are not yet scheduled. So I think you had better schedule the other witnesses for early November, because the three Judges will then be present. The Judges will be involved in other matters, but we can always find the time to hear a few witnesses. We should also know as far as the experts are concerned what we will do, because you told us of two pathologists, forensic pathologists, and we need a document to tell us what these forensic pathologists are coming here to tell us. As of now, if it is absolutely necessary for forensic pathologists to come here, it is quite enough to have one, we don't need two. And as regards Ndengejeho, the other expert witness, we have received an objection on the part of the Prosecution. I don't know if you have received it, whether you have been served with that document which we have received. So we have to examine all these problems, because the Prosecution objects: first of all, does not accept the report, if I correctly understood; and secondly, the Prosecution wants to know whether, if the witness is to be heard, that the Prosecution be allowed to cross-examine the witness. We should like to know if you yourself have the intention to examine the expert witness and how long it would take, because it should not take more than a day, maximum a day and a half, because as we told you, from the end of the month we are going to be very busy, all of us respectively, and we ask you therefore to make efforts so that we can hear the two factual witnesses and the potential NQ4 -- you have not made any application, so we still don't know what you intend to do with him -- and the three expert witnesses that you had been planning to cite. So it is about time you made all these matters clear to us. As you know, the Trial Chamber can refuse an expert witness's appearance. We should like to know before that exactly what those expert witnesses are going to contribute to your client's cause.That is what I wanted to tell you, but I do not see how we can sit as a Bench of two any further. So that implies that we must await November, early November, if you will, we can settle remaining matters.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. The question can be answered, but there is a difficulty. Could the Trial Chamber tell us -- could the Bench tell us, as Judge Reddy will only be present after 31st of October, "We can hear your witnesses until the 2nd, the 3rd, the 4th or the 5th", but the witness <stage>(sic)</stage> does not seem to be saying what is the time limit, because I think there is the trial of the ministers which is beginning on the 3rd in which the Judges will be sitting. If Judge Reddy arrives on the 31st, how are things going to happen?I think that the other question with regard to the testimony of the expert witnesses, the Trial Chamber could decide that the reports of the expert witnesses are accepted as exhibits. It all depends what you want to do with this, what the Bench intends to do with it, but we should like to know, we of the Defence, the factual witnesses and the others, what is the deadline for their testimony? Because we were told that we should do our best for the presentation of the Defence evidence by the end of October, but there has been this unforeseen occurrence. So if you could tell us we could make the necessary inference, and if counsel for the Prosecution can make the necessary arrangements so it doesn't all depend on the Defence or the Bench. I don't know how it is going to happen exactly, but could you tell us how much longer the trial will last? While it was supposed to end by the 31st of October, and on the basis of what we were told we have tried to coordinate our activities. But in the present state of affairs, it is somewhat delicate.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, it would appear counsel is trying to create or perceive obstacles where there are none. My understanding of what Madam President has said is that there is a possibility that we may be able to sit in November. Our request, Your Honours, is that this possibility be looked into in greater detail. We are fully aware that three Judges of this Chamber will be involved in other trials, but we believe that in consultation with the President of the Tribunal and registry, if we were given priority as a case that is in its last stages of the Defence hearing, we wouldn't mind if there was a shift, for example, and Mil. 1 could sit in the morning and we could be given the afternoon or vice versa, just so that we can dispose of outstanding business. And at least this is what we understood Your Lordship to be suggesting, and we fully support it and we are ready to proceed on those terms. Regarding the experts, we are yet to receive the expert reports of the pathologists, and at this stage, therefore, we cannot comment on the relevance or probative value. We reserve our right, of course, once we are served with reports, whether to raise objection or not. In the meantime, it would be courteous of counsel if he could serve on us the detailed curricula vitae of all the experts he intends to call. Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>I don't think that Defence can accept what the Prosecutor has just said. The Defence is not raising any obstacle. I think that everyone is aware of the fact that the Defence is looking for ways and means for everything to proceed as smoothly as possible for this case in this Trial Chamber. I will say again that we were prepared to complete our case by the 31st of October 2003. The current situation is not the fault of the Defence. Absolutely not, Madam President. We have put in the request for the appointment of the expert witnesses in time. We introduced the list of witnesses in good time, and I really would have liked that what the Prosecutor has just said could have been said on the 28th of July or August, because we are dealing with human science, and in fact what we say today is not necessarily true tomorrow. If we had known that this obstacle might arise, then we would have done everything possible to deal with it in anticipation. The Defence is here in good faith to provide all contribution to find a solution to the problem. If the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that it is said that the Judge will come on the 31st and we shall continue without telling us when we are going to stop, then that is a problem.Wouldn't it be possible in that case, and this is my contribution to the matter, that we organise an informal status conference Friday or Monday, and once we have all of the information we can decide. I mean, what the Prosecutor has said really here in the courtroom might lead us on a path that might not be the one that we would choose if we have the time to choose the proper path. And, Madam President, if there is someone in this courtroom who would like to see the case finish on the 31st, that is the Defence. And we would rather not be in Arusha on the 1st of November 2003, and we have done everything we can. We are paying for the witnesses who had already been brought to Arusha.So someone should -- my learned friend should not say that we are the ones raising the obstacles.</p>

            <p>Mr. Prosecutor, I think that we must remain serene until the very end, and I wanted to thank you, actually, because I feel that you have cooperated, and it is because of your cooperation that we were able to bring this trial to the current stage we are in. But we will have to find solutions to the problems being raised, and these problems are not the fault of any particular person, these are unforeseen events. The Judge had to absent himself, and even if we wanted to continue, we could not continue because the witnesses are not here. We can suggest a date. We were waiting to find out if you were open to our suggestions. Now it seems that the parties are willing to listen to us. We had already raised the problem with the President of the Tribunal and also with the court management section, but first we wanted to obtain your consent, and once your consent was obtained then this could be finalised.This is what we suggest: there is no reason to bring the witnesses now because I think there are still problems that need to be resolved with respect to these witnesses. Therefore, we shall sit after the 3rd of November on other cases, but we can make arrangements to sit, for example, on the Government trial, Government 1, in the morning -- or the so-called Government 1 and the so-called Military trial in the morning, and then in the afternoon perhaps we could sit in for Gacumbitsi, and this would allow us to continue as of the 3rd of November. And I believe that in view of the fact that we do not have many witnesses to hear, perhaps in a week we should be able to finish, and if we are not able to complete within the first week, then possibly we can continue into the second week of November if everyone agrees. But that is what we can say. Nevertheless, we believe that we should be able to complete on the 7th of November. Now, as an informal meeting that you suggested, that is true, we can meet again if you wish. I am prepared to meet with all of the parties, perhaps in my office. Instead of having to organise a status conference, we could meet in my office and have a meeting to resolve the pending matters. Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, the Prosecutor is ready to abide your decision and proceed on the 3rd of November as proposed. We have no objection. However, there are matters that may not lend themselves to an efficient utilisation of trial days if we start on the 3rd November, the first being the availability of the factual witnesses. WVSS did mention that they would be available after 31st October, so the question is, will they be in Arusha for trial on 3rd November? The second point relates to the pathologists. Just assuming for a moment that their expert report was filed tomorrow, the 22nd of October, the earliest they can testify would be after 21 days, which would be the 12th of November, so that too creates problems. And in order maybe, Your Honours, to circumvent those problems, we may wish to start on Monday, 10th November, rather than on Monday, 3rd November, so that once we start on the 10th of November with the assurance that all the outstanding witnesses, expert and factual, are in town, we can proceed with the trial on a non-stop basis and conclude it. What we are avoiding is starting on 3rd November and not being able to proceed for the rest of the week. I would rather if we started, we went through this trial and disposed of all the witnesses smoothly, rather than having the hearings truncated by absences and the like. Most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Counsel Kouengoua, it's true the expert report -- reports have not yet been filed -- as far as the forensic pathologists know, they haven't -- and it's true that this problem might delay us somewhat because -- as the report must be filed twenty-one days before the witnesses come to testify, that might cause some problems. I had made a suggestion that we begin on the 3rd of November. Now the Prosecutor has made a suggestion that we begin on the 10th of November so that all of the witnesses can be there and the twenty-one day delay might be respected. </p>

As long as all the parties are agreed that we can proceed in November on an afternoon shift basis, the final details are all contingent upon witness availability and the twenty-one day rule, and WVSS should be in a position to advise Your Lordships on the scheduled arrivals and departures of witnesses.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Most obliged, Your Honours. The first matter, Your Honour, which I said goes to form, concerns the programme for completion of the Defence case. We were notified last Friday there'd only be two factual witnesses this week. Now, in the informal status conference held in your chamber on or about the 22nd of October this year, with Judge Egorov in attendance, it was my understanding that in the event of the non-availability of the expert to testify after the factual witnesses, the Accused would be required to take the stand. Now, subsequent to that meeting, Your Honours, Defence counsel contested that position. So we would like to learn from the Chamber what the exact position is and submit that an earlier resolution enables all parties here to plan from an even keel. The second and more important matter, Your Honours, arises from your decision of 11th November concerning the Prosecutor's motion for the exclusion of the expert report and proposed evidence of Pascal Ndengejeho. The Prosecutor now seeks directions, Your Honours, on how this Chamber proposes to proceed with the evidence of Pascal Ndengejeho in light of your decision. Now, during lunchtime, Your Honours, the Defence filed a motion seeking a reconsideration of your decision of 11th November concerning the expert. I'm hesitant, Your Honours, to join issue with the Defence on its request for review because I've not fully read or understood the motion, having been filed during the lunch break in a language I have difficulty with. I will, however, proceed to raise Prosecutor's concerns regarding your decision. Now, in the said decision, Your Honours, you partially granted the Prosecutor's motion and disqualified Pascal Ndengejeho as an expert but permitted him to testify as a Defence witness nonetheless to matters concerning Rusumo commune during the months April and May 1994. Now, our understanding of your decision, Your Honours, and which we submit ought to be the correct interpretation, is that witness Pascal Ndengejeho cannot proffer opinion evidence, having been disqualified as an expert. He can only appear as a witness of fact, like the past 18 Defence witnesses heard so far. This presupposes, Your Honours, that Ndengejeho was a witness to facts in issue before you and that his evidence can assist in the proper determination of these issues if his evidence is relevant and probative. Now, two issues arise from this interpretation of your decision. First, it's a matter of public record that Pascal Ndengejeho took refuge at the French embassy in Kigali on the 8th of April 1994, where he remained until the 12th of April 1994, when he was evacuated by the French air force to Bujumbura. At no time relevant to the charges in the indictment was Pascal Ndengejeho in Rusumo commune. It would follow, therefore, Your Honours, that he cannot be a witness of fact in compliance with paragraph 9 of your decision. And we submit, Your Honours, that had you adverted to this fact, your decision would probably have been different. The second but related issue concerning the limitations you've placed on the content of his testimony arises from the exhibits that the Defence seek to tender into evidence through this witness, namely, videos of the Belgian Senate enquiry. We submit, Your Honours, that this is a most insidious, if not underhand, method of introducing other people's evidence onto the record without giving the adverse party the right to test such evidence through cross-examination. The Defence has had all the opportunity to call Luc Marechal and Marcel Guerin to testify for Gacumbitsi, but have chosen not to, and ought not to be allowed to present such untested evidence by way of videotapes. We submit, Your Honours, that to permit such conduct would be to undermine the provisions of Rule 90 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence which require that a witness be heard directly by a Chamber unless a deposition is granted pursuant to Rule 71.Now, these matters, Your Honours, are complicated further because this witness, who was neither in Rusumo nor is an expert, does not come to this Chamber without bias. He has opined in the conclusion to his report that the Accused Gacumbitsi is innocent. And we submit, Your Honours, that by doing so, he invades your province as triers of fact in circumstances, Your Honours, where he has not heard the witnesses you have heard in this trial. He has, Your Honours -- and if I may be facetious -- become a fourth judge whose sole purpose is to sum up the case for the Defence. Indeed, Your Honours, I'm prepared to waive cross-examination of this witness altogether if the Defence will waive its closing statement, because that is what Ndengejeho is here to do and is doing so in a manner that is most insidious and contrary to fair play. The long and short of my request, Your Honours, is that short of reviewing your decision altogether, you ought to give clear directions on what is properly permissible before this Tribunal, which we submit is testimony within the confines of Rules 89 and 90 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. One, the evidence ought to be relevant and have probative value for it to be admitted onto the record; two, a witness must be heard directly by this Chamber unless a deposition is granted under Rule 71. That, Your Honours, is my brief submission regarding the Prosecutor's request for directions. Concerning, Your Honours, the Defence motion filed during the lunch hour today, I wish to make brief comment seriatim. In the paragraphs, Your Honours, on legal reasoning, the Defence does not state the legal basis of their motion for review or reconsideration. We submit, Your Honours, that the powers of revision are spelt out in Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and only apply to final judgments, and decisions are not decisions such as the decision of this Chamber of 11th November 2003. We concede, however, that Your Honours retain the inherent powers under Rule 54 to revisit your own decisions in the interests of justice. From a closer reading, Your Honours, of the Defence motion, though couched as a request for revision or reconsideration, it's actually an appeal against your decision of 11th November 2003. The Defence is impugning your decision and asking you to sit in appellate jurisdiction, and we submit that there's no legal basis for such an appeal. I now turn, Your Honours, to the grounds that the Defence advance in support of the appeal. The first is that your decision is contrary to Article 20, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Statute, insofar as it denies the Accused a fair hearing. Nowhere, Your Honours, does counsel show how the Accused has been denied a fair hearing by reason of your decision. We submit that the disqualification of an expert and the exclusion of evidence are clearly matters at the discretion of this Chamber and counsel has failed to show how such discretion has been erroneously exercised. Under chapter 2 of the Defence motion, Your Honours, they cite -- the Defence cites a number of what they refer to as erroneous grounds. The Defence also refers to a Prosecution motion dated 17th October 2003 regarding its objection to the expert report of Pascal Ndengejeho. We correct the impression, Your Honours, that it was a motion. It wasn't a motion, but rather a notice of objection filed within 14 days, which is a mandatory requirement under Rule 94 bis. This notice, Your Honours, did not bar the Prosecution from filing a substantive motion under Rules 54, 73 and 89 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence for the exclusion of the proposed evidence and the report of Pascal Ndengejeho. And we submit, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor's motion of 3rd November 2003 was properly before Your Lordships and is common practice when screening experts at a preliminary hearing in order to determine whether an expert should be accepted or not. The Defence further submit, Your Honours, in the motion that Trial Chamber III in The Prosecutor v. Semanza qualified Pascal Ndengejeho as a witness. We submit, Your Honours, that is a misstatement of the record in Semanza, which we placed before you in support of our application. The transcript of 28th January 2002 in the case of The Prosecutor v. Semanza will not only indicate that I was on the record present in court on that day for the Prosecution but that Trial Chamber III, presided over by Judge Lloyd Williams, disqualified Ndengejeho as an expert witness and only allowed him to testify in the interests of justice. Your decision therefore, Your Honours, is entirely in harmony with the approach taken by Trial Chamber III in the Semanza case. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, Your Honours, they wouldn't because we have very little expectations from this witness and what he proffers in the interests of justice because he's been disqualified as an expert and can therefore only appear as a witness of fact. In the strictest sense, he cannot appear as a witness of fact because he was never in Rusumo during the months of April and May of 1994, because it's a matter of public record both in the Semanza trial and in the Cyangugu trial 2nd of July 2002 that this witness was evacuated from Rwanda, from Kigali, by the French air force on the 12th of April 1994. So he cannot testify from knowledge as a witness of fact of what happened in Rusumo. And you have heard witnesses of fact both for the Prosecution and for the Defence who were present in Rusumo at all times relevant to the allegations in the indictment. And that is why Your Honours' decision makes it quite complicated unless directions are given -- specific directions are given elaborating on your ruling at paragraph 9, what is this witness going to testify to if he wasn't in Rwanda and has never been back. If it's a question of reading newspaper articles, I'm sure Your Lordships too can read newspaper articles and reach your own conclusions. With your leave, I'll go back to the Defence motion filed today under the heading "Lack of Equity" in which the Defence submits that a work plan was agreed on but that the Chamber went ahead and made a decision on the ground that no response had been filed by the Defence, which is erroneous, Your Honours. The lack of response referred to in your decision of 11th of November is a Defence response to the Prosecutor's motion for exclusion of the evidence of Ndengejeho filed on the 3rd of November. Now, pursuant to Rule 73, the legal basis of that Prosecution motion, the Defence was obliged to respond within five days. In the event that it didn't, Your Lordships were entitled, as you did, to rule on the motion. In conclusion, Your Honours, we'd submit that the Defence motion should not be entertained as it amounts to an appeal, a misconceived appeal, over which you have no jurisdiction, and should therefore be struck out. We are most obliged, Your Honours.</p>

I'm all the more embarrassed at the comportment of counsel for the Prosecution, the Chamber will have noted; I don't know whether I'm responding to the Chamber or what the Prosecutor has said because the question put to the Prosecutor was, "Do you have any motions?" And he answered that he didn't have any motions, only housekeeping matters. Now, how can you in dealing with housekeeping matters address a matter of a motion raised by one of the parties? I just don't think that's possible.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I thank you, Madam President. I was saying that when matters of housekeeping are addressed and that is introduced in dealing with a motion by one of the parties, I don't think that is pertinent, but I should not like that tomorrow before this Chamber it be said that Gacumbitsi had at any time done anything to slow down his trial or hinder the proper functioning of the Trial Chamber, and that is what the Prosecutor wants, and we will not follow him down that road.Madam President, the matters that arises now, while awaiting the Prosecution to read my motion, on the 3rd of November, the Prosecutor raised a motion and at the end of which he requested that a decision be taken before the 17th of November 2003. We are at the 17th of November 2003, a date on which we should have heard my witnesses of fact. What the Prosecutor must say in order to allow all the parties to advance and the Trial Chamber to fulfil its task, why has he asked for a decision to be rendered before the 17th of December -- November, excuse me. Madam President, that is the question because -- but if the Prosecutor cannot ask that question, it comes back to me to ask the Trial Chamber to review their decision of the 17th of November. I don't need to lay out the grounds for my motion. But as -- I should like to tell the Prosecutor that as an attorney for the Tribunal, you have the imperium and you have the jurisdiction, it's up to you to analyse and decide. If you had taken the trouble to see my motion -- to look at my motion, you will have seen that the sources of law are not only the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the Statute. I also referred to case law, to precedents. And the precedent is the precedent of the Tribunal. It is constant and wise. Why doesn't the Prosecutor want for Gacumbitsi's trial to end on the 31st of October? That was the date on which you'd asked us to conclude, and you did not extend the date. Judge Reddy's availability is not a reason for extending delay. How can you proudly stand before the Trial Chamber and say on the 3rd November you raised a motion, on what basis? I think you should have concluded to allow the Trial Chamber to decide in chambers. When I filed the expert's report on the 6th of October in accordance with Rule 94 <stage>(B)</stage>
              <stage>(i),</stage>
              <stage>(ii)</stage> and <stage>(iii),</stage> you are justifying my motion inasmuch as you dissimulated from me a procedure, and for reasons that I do not feel obliged to divulge here. Remember on the 16th of October, what did you say in the matter of The Prosecutor v. Gacumbitsi? The Defence must tell us, referring to Ndengejeho, for how long they intend to have him testify, because in Semanza it took two weeks for him to be examined and cross-examined. Have you forgotten that, Mr. Prosecutor? It was on page 58, I think. I put that also in my motion. The Prosecutor made reference to various Rules and purported that there was some confusion on the part of the Defence team. We are in open session for the truth. I would want to be shown the text of Rule 94. I would want to be shown Rule 94, which comprises <stage>(i)</stage> and <stage>(ii)</stage> since May 2003. Yet, these are the points on which you succeeded in surprising the Judges by introducing a motion, whereas you did not have the right to do so. You were time barred. And since this is not a matter of trickery, this is the Gacumbitsi case, it is not a closed session, Madam President, allow me to read the famous Rule 94, with your permission. Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 66 <stage>(A)</stage> to Rule 73 bis <stage>(B),</stage> Rule 73 <stage>(B)</stage> of the Rules, "The full statement of any expert witness called by a party shall be disclosed to the opposing party as early as possible and shall be filed with the Trial Chamber not less than twenty-one days prior to the date on which the expert is expected to testify." <stage>(B)</stage> Within fourteen days of filing of the statement of the expert witness, the opposing party shall file a notice to the Trial Chamber indicating whether: <stage>(i)</stage> it accepts the expert witness statement; or <stage>(ii)</stage> it wishes to cross-examine the expert witness; and <stage>(iii)</stage> if it wishes to cross-examine the expert witness." I had this witness testify on Monday, 6th October, at the end of the presentation of the Defence case. On the 7th of October the Prosecutor responded and asked the Chamber in his notice to allow it to cross-examine the expert, and this is established. Prosecutor, I think that on 22 October, when we met for the smooth functioning of this Chamber, the Prosecutor knew what was -- still had to be done and who had to appear before this Chamber. The only matter in issue which we were still discussing was to know whether it was useful for Professor Lecomte and the doctor to come both at the same time. Madam President, the Prosecutor responded on the 17th of October, as I said. He said he was going to cross-examine the expert witness. He recognised that witness's status expressly on 3 November, 28 days after, instead of the 14 days as imposed by the Rule. How can he bring a motion challenging the status or the report filed by that witness? The Prosecutor was time barred. Madam President, Your Honours, I am compelled to respond to the Prosecutor because I would like Gacumbitsi's trial to come to an end within the time limit that we agreed on jointly. And I do not intend to shy away from this responsibility. Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor talked about 31 January. No, it is rather the hearing of 22 January for an expert witness in the matter of Laurent Semanza, and your colleague who was the presiding Judge of that Trial Chamber at the time, in light or in view of the report and the discussions that followed during the hearing, was of the opinion that it was no longer possible to hear Pascal Ndengejeho on his entire report, but the examination-in-chief and the cross-examination were limited to paragraph 2, entitled "The Conflict in Rwanda -- Situation of the Armed Conflict in Rwanda from 1930," and the paragraph was entitled "Laurent Semanza, the big bourgmestre." This is what was decided -- this is what was agreed on to be heard, but when I hear the Prosecutor say that it was out of favour, that it was out of indulgence that the funds of the Tribunal were committed to bring Ndengejeho to this Tribunal, this may appear true to the Prosecutor, but to me the decision made by the Bench is a decision that is binding on everyone and it is a decision that is made with seriousness. How can you decide to hear an expert witness and then somebody comes to say that you did so simply because you had realised that the witness was already in Arusha? Who is that insult directed to? To the International Criminal Tribunal? To the United Nations? Madam President, in the motion that I filed, I stated that -- I was referring to pages 16 to 70 and that will be beginning with paragraph 2 of the transcript. And this cannot be the subject of any discussion whatsoever. Madam President, Your Honours, I would like to understand. The Prosecutor says that you do not have the power to review your own decision. I would like the Prosecutor to tell me what Rule he relies on to overlook the time limit set by Rule 94. Your Chamber advised the parties that these proceedings take place in mutual respect and friendliness. The Prosecutor, who is used to calling me at night, I told him on the 22nd that I was leaving for Cameroon. My professional domicile is in Cameroon. Did he at any point in time verify whether his motion, which was no longer up to date or on time, whether that motion reached me? He did not verify that. Prosecutor, in your motion of 22nd October you told the Trial Chamber that in the event you admitted Pascal Ndengejeho, the Prosecutor will request to cross-examine that witness. Prosecutor, how can you cross-examine someone who was taken away from the French embassy since the 12th of April? Why did you not disclose that information to the Bench so as to enable them to assess, even post facto, what you were saying? I cannot come to the conclusion that you hid that fact. Rather, I think that you yourself were not aware of that fact. And when you are not aware of something, Prosecutor, a proverb in my village says that it is better under the circumstances to acquire more information before asserting what you cannot prove. Mr. Prosecutor, on 17 October you informed us that Pascal Ndengejeho had been examined for two weeks. That is the expression you used, verbatim. I was not there. Gacumbitsi was not there. Do you think that in two weeks he was asked for how many days he stayed in the embassy? Have you had a look at the questions that were asked of him by Mr. Osuji, how many ministers were members of the cabinet, the political organisation, who were the ministers who were in charge of -- who held state powers? To answer these questions, would it have been necessary to be at the Chinese embassy? I do not think so. Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor repeated before you and before me, without him being embarrassed in any manner whatsoever, that when the Chamber noticed that the Defence was not responding to their motion of 3 November, that it was overlooked -- Madam President, this is what Rule 17 of the Rules says, unless the Chamber provides otherwise: When the time limit for filing a motion or when a motion --</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. Very well. Well, when you feel much pain, then you have to shout loud enough. Madam President, Your Honours, that being the case -- I said, Your Honours, because I should conclude -- I said that your Chamber has the power, has the right to review, to reconsider its decision of 11 November. For what reasons? At the time the Prosecutor filed this motion, you did not know that it was time barred. The Prosecutor never told you in his motion that the expert witness was at the French embassy. The Prosecutor never made it possible for you to know that Defence counsel did not receive disclosure of their motion. And the review was already made on 18th July 2003 by trial -- in the matter of The Prosecutor v. Théoneste Bagosora et al.On 31 March 2002 the Appeals Chamber of the same Chamber in the matter of The Prosecutor v. Barayagwiza had laid down the principle and admitted that a decision could be reviewed if, at the time it was rendered, the factual circumstances were not known to the Judge, and I have also brought to you that information today. Madam President, Your Honours, with all due respect, I am sure that you are going to accede to this -- you are going to grant this motion. But since we are -- since this is a science and we are in the field of law, if the Chamber is of the opinion that its decision is irreversible, I respectfully submit, Madam President, Your Honours, that I should be allowed to apply Rule 73 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence by having recourse to other remedies. Because one thing remained unexplained and it is that the Prosecutor so far -- I'm going to conclude soon -- the Prosecutor has not said why he required that the decision be delivered on the 17th. I would have also liked -- well, the 17th was the date for resumption of trial and for the date when my witnesses had to be heard. I would therefore strongly wish that the Trial Chamber give me -- or grant my motion, rather, before the Gacumbitsi trial, which was suspended and which had to resume today. I think my motion should be granted. It is a matter of fairness. It is a matter of equity, and I know that equity is of utmost importance to your Chamber. Over and above my client, it also goes to the credibility of your jurisdiction. In my motion I included Rule 15 -- or Article 15, entitled "Impartiality of the Trial": The counsel are requested not to do anything that may cast discredit on the trial and the counsel must do everything so that no other person discredits the proceedings of the Tribunal. I thank you, and I will not fail in my duties.</p>

            <p>Just a very brief response, Your Honours, that counsel has failed to see the difference between the Prosecutor's notice of objection filed under 94 bis <stage>(B)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the subsequent motion filed -- for exclusion filed under Rules 54, 73 and 89 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The point I want to underscore, Your Honours, is that the notice of objection filed under 94 bis <stage>(B)</stage> was not a bar to a substantive motion under Rules 54, 73 and 89 <stage>(C)</stage> for the exclusion of evidence that we had indicated we'd object to. The second point, Your Honours, arises from counsel's allegations of lack of fairness, by which I understand him to be submitting that the Prosecutor was allowed expert testimony, so should the Defence. Such an argument, Your Honours, is misplaced for two reasons: first, the Prosecutor's expert witness, Alison Des Forges, was qualified and accepted by this Chamber, and the sole purpose for her testimony was to place the killings we allege took place in Rusumo in the overall context of the killings in Rwanda in April through July 1994. Ndengejeho, on the other hand, Your Honours, has been disqualified by Your Lordships, and counsel shouldn't therefore mix apples and oranges by equating Ndengejeho with Alison Des Forges. The second reason, Your Honours, is that Alison's evidence was necessitated by the Defence failure to indicate at the commencement of trial which facts Defence was admitting and which facts it contested. So the trial started on the premise that the Defence contested all the facts. Now, it subsequently turns out, Your Honours, during the Defence case that a number of Prosecution allegations concerning killings in Rusumo were admitted by Defence evidence, so the only issue for determination before Your Lordships is whether the Accused participated in the killings and rapes as we allege, and we submit in that regard, Your Honours, that the proposed evidence of Ndengejeho does not help you in the proper determination of the issues at bar. Most obliged. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

This is the boilerplate clause, the inherent powers of the Judge or Chamber in trial. Rule 73 provides for filing motions, motions that are not preliminary motions under Rule 72, and gives deadlines for responses, in this case, five days. And then Rule 89 concerns admission of evidence, and more particularly, 89 <stage>(C),</stage> which provides that a Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value. Now, in our motion for exclusion of the expert report and the proposed evidence, we relied on these three Rules, and this is independent of the notice of objection filed earlier under 94 bis <stage>(B)</stage>

And my submission was that this wasn't a final judgment. However, we do concede that the Chamber has inherent powers under Rule 54 to revisit its own decisions in the interests of justice. What we contest, however, Your Honours, is that this isn't a request for review. He is basically -- counsel is basically appealing your decision of 11th November and asking you to assume appellate jurisdiction. He's not asking for review, although he submits it's a review. This is an appeal. He wants your decision overturned. </p>

            <p>Yes, indeed, Madam President, they are present. We were told that one of them is not well and the witness section got drugs for them. We arrived here on Saturday. I said that there is a witness who was heard -- who was listened to by my colleagues, but I have not had the opportunity to see any of them. I was focusing on the decision of the 11th. So it is only a request we are respectfully presenting to you, Madam President. If the Chamber doesn't find that there is any particular inconvenience in this, we would -- we intend to proceed in such way that everything would be in order. I would suggest that both witnesses be heard tomorrow. It's only a discussion, Madam President, unless the Chamber finds that there is something very seriously wrong with my suggestion.</p>

            <p>The witnesses who were supposed to appear when we adjourned on the 22nd, Madam President, was XW13 and XW22, who arrived from Rwanda. There was also the expert witness, Pascal Ndengejeho; there was also the two expert witnesses, Professor Lecomte and Professor Vorhaouer from Paris. Pursuant to Rule 94, the witness -- the Prosecution accepted their testimony and didn't have the -- was not of the opinion that his testimony was not necessary, so there is no change in the schedule which we had on the 22nd of October, Madam President. With regard to the forensic experts, the French forensic experts, I believe there was no problem with their testimony and they are going to testify. And that is why I would respectfully request that the factual witnesses be heard tomorrow, unless you are of the contrary opinion.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>The proceedings are called to order. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We are going to deliver our decision. On 17 November 2003, the Defence brought before the Trial Chamber a motion, an extremely urgent motion, for the review of the decision delivered on 11 November 2003 by Trial Chamber III. The Defence submit that the Prosecutor had 14 days to challenge the status of expert of Mr. Ndengejeho or to request to exercise its right to cross-examine him. For the Defence, the 17th of October 2003 -- on the 17th of October 2003, the Prosecutor chose to object to the report filed on 6 October, 2003, thus waiving his right to challenge the status of expert of the witness. The Defence also purports that it has a right -- that its right to a fair trial has been violated because the Trial Chamber did not take into consideration its answer before -- or its reply before deciding on the Prosecutor's motion. The Defence requested the Trial Chamber to review its decision in the light of these new issues, or to authorise the Defence to lodge an appeal against this decision. At the hearing of 17 November 2003, the Prosecutor presented an oral response to that motion, challenging the foreclosure and inadmissibility of his motion of 3 November 2003 raised by the Defence. The Prosecutor submits that revision can be founded only on Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and can only arise on matters relating to merits. The Prosecutor also presented a counterclaim for the review of the same decision of 11 November 2003, on the grounds that Mr. Pascal Ndengejeho was not in Rusumo in April 1994 and that, consequently, he cannot be a witness of the facts which occurred in the Rusumo commune in April and May 1994. The Trial Chamber takes note of the conditions in which the Prosecutor's motion was disclosed to the Defence and also of all the other elements relating thereto which the Defence brought to its knowledge. The Trial Chamber recalls the competence of every Judge to review its own decision, if new circumstances emerge after its decision so justify, and this is in conformity with established case law in this Tribunal. Consequently, the Trial Chamber admits the application for review, recalling its competence with regard to expert witnesses under paragraph 8 of our decision of 11 November 2003. The Trial Chamber is of the opinion that it has the competence to accept or dismiss, in whole or in part, the contribution of an expert witness and that it can exercise this competence proprio motu. In the circumstances, and for the reasons already presented in the decision of 11 November 2003, referred to above, the Trial Chamber dismisses, on the merits, the motion for the review of its decision. The Trial Chamber holds that this decision does not in any manner whatsoever adversely affect the equity, the rapidity of the process nor its outcome and that, consequently, it is appropriate to dismiss the motion for certification of the appeals Defence in accordance with Rule 73 <stage>(B)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The Trial Chamber dismisses the motions filed by the parties. I will now turn to Mr. Kouengoua. Mr. Kouengoua, you have a witness of fact this afternoon; is that right? </p>

            <p>No. We have no further witnesses, Madam, but it would be preferable that the Accused, the defendant, be heard after Mr. Ndengejeho. I merely wanted to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to the fact that the trial was due to conclude on the 31st of October <stage>(sic),</stage> so inasmuch as we resumed on the 17th, I feel we have a few days before us to refine a few points. I don't really know. Maybe it's not always a bad things to have a bit of time. We can take advantage of that. </p>

            <p>Mr. Kouengoua, we need your assistance. Could you tell us how long the Accused's testimony will take, that is the evidence in-chief, your examination of him? How long will it take? Have you any estimate, any idea? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Excuse me, Your Honour. As things stand, we couldn't say how long it would take. But as it is Judge Reddy who is putting the question and wasn't there, we have covered a lot of ground. We covered -- we heard four witnesses in a very short time, so please rest assured that we'll do whatever is necessary to avoid any difficulties. Going back to my notes here, we adjourned on the 21st of October. We had six trial days remaining, therefore, and I'm sure that in that time, we can do whatever is necessary. So as far as the witness -- the Defence is concerned, we feel no anxiety. We shall be able to do what's necessary in the time available. </p>

          <sp who="#judge-reddy">
            <speaker>JUDGE REDDY:</speaker>
            <p>The only thing is that as from the 26th, which is next Wednesday, the President will be presiding in another case, and as you know, we are already in the Military case. So if we don't finish by next Wednesday, this case will have to stand over until next year, for the evidence to be completed. And I'm sure you don't want that. I don't think anybody wants that. So I'm just wondering why we cannot save time by introducing the Accused now and calling the expert witness later. I don't know what the reasoning is, what the thinking is, behind this -- your strategy, but generally, in many jurisdictions, the Accused gives evidence first. I see no particular advantage, but you may wish to explain. I'm merely trying to save time, that's all, with the permission of the President. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Your Honour. As regards time, Gacumbitsi's Defence has never wanted and never -- and we never let ourselves be -- let be extended beyond the end of November. That has never been our wish. And please be rest assured, we've done everything necessary to stay within the time limit. And now you mention the date of the 26th of November. Believe us, the Defence understands very well what is being said from the Bench. We will do whatever we can, even to understand you further. But understanding is like an elevator which must be shuttled back and forth. But sometimes we found ourselves waiting very long for the others to send the elevator back to us. But please rest assured we shall get through what we have to get through within the time limit. </p>

            <p>We've already told you, Counsel, that as of the 26th of November, we will be hearing another matter. I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that you mentioned that you had six days of hearings remaining, owed to you. But if you consider that we only have Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning, plus Monday -- we don't even know whether Tuesday might not be a holiday. So you see, we don't have much time. So couldn't we already do something so as to not lose tomorrow? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, thank you. I think when I mentioned six days, I was referring to the amount of time given to the Defence to find the witnesses and call them. And we are still within the time limits fixed as they were during October. We are doing the maximum that we can. That's all we are saying, Madam President. Madam President, please, I think I cannot ignore elements such as those just now brought to my attention, but Mr. Pascal Ndengejeho is coming tomorrow. I think that in such a case, when it is the party calling the witness, they should be informed first. I don't know, I've never met the gentleman. But anyhow, as far as we are concerned, we undertake to do what we've undertaken to do in Gacumbitsi's Defence so as the Trial Chamber should not suffer in matters of time used or time available. Now, whether it is to the cost of the Accused, that is another matter, but we will do our duty as his counsel. Your Honour, I was going to forget, I think that as far as Ndengejeho is concerned, he will only be examined for a couple of hours, one or two hours. It won't take us any time at all, only two hours. So really the only person remaining is Mr. Gacumbitsi, and I don't think in spite of his size, it will take ten days to examine and cross-examine him. </p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Well, what we are suggesting is that he should start testifying as of tomorrow, as we don't have anybody else lined up for tomorrow, because, otherwise, we will be running risks. I told you we have to hear another matter, and we cannot go beyond the date we have given you. So it is to -- if we do not sit tomorrow, it will be a risk that you are running and we merely want to draw your attention to that.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I think another solution would be that if there isn't enough time, you might decide not to hear the Accused or partially hear him, but if I was told at what time Ndengejeho was coming tomorrow, perhaps I could tell you before lunchtime that I would call Ndengejeho. But as regards Gacumbitsi, I don't think we can hear him tomorrow -- I am prepared to hear him tomorrow, to examine him tomorrow, for very obvious reasons, but if I'm told Ndengejeho is coming in the morning, then I have no objection whatsoever to calling him in the afternoon. </p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. We take due note. Unfortunately, we have not been told at what time Ndengejeho is arriving in Arusha. We are only given the date, the 19th of November. I should like to be informed of the precise time, and if he arrives tomorrow morning, then we can sit tomorrow afternoon and hear Mr. Ndengejeho. Very well, that's the way we are.

            <p>Madam, I should merely like to ask the counsel for the Prosecution if he withdraws the objection -- will he object again tomorrow? Because that is a problem coming as a witness of fact. Yesterday, a witness -- the Prosecution said he could not be a witness of fact because he wasn't there, but if he has any further objections, he should make them now so that we have better things to do than to argue about it again tomorrow. We are planning to call him tomorrow as a witness for facts. He will be tired, he's arriving, there is no point bringing him in to object again tomorrow. Let him say so now and thereby we can save time. And then I can also talk with Gacumbitsi, to prepare him, so that we can save time and not wait until Tuesday or Wednesday next week. </p>

We shall now adjourn, as I have said, and we'll see later as to the objections. We have received an item of information. Apparently, Mr. Ndengejeho is arriving tomorrow morning at 9:45 a.m., unless there is any change.

But I hope that with your experience and the experience of your colleagues on the Bench, that if Ndengejeho comes to testify for the Defence, we should have had an idea at least of this information. I know he is someone coming out of the plane. I don't know if he's coming by plane or what. It is somewhat delicate. It's a witness that we have called. It's our witness. And it's true that they are giving us the information. When you've just asked us whether we have any other witness, is that really lawful? Is it courteous? Is it proper?

It's at this very instant that we got the information. We were not informed. It's as we get the information, we pass it on to you. The problem is Mr. Ndengejeho only confirmed his arrival now. It's only now that we got the information. I don't think there is any need to-- there is no need to throw the responsibility on anyone else's shoulders. We just got the information, we just gave it to you. That's it. </p>

It wasn't because we didn't want to, but because it was not possible. I should like to ask you, Professor, if the document you forwarded to me for filing with the Tribunal -- have you kept yourself a copy of the document?

            <p>Counsel, perhaps I should not say so, but I arrived in Windhoek on the 17th, at about 11 o'clock from South Africa. And since the month of October, I had informed that I would be in South Africa from the 12th to the 17th, in a meeting, a very important meeting for Africa, concerning the directors of the media, managers of the media, who had to ensure that the message of reconciliation is broadcast throughout SADC. So I arrived in Windhoek at 1100, passing by my office. I saw that I did have an invitation to come to Arusha, and I directly telephoned to the witness section, who told me that there was a ticket sent by DHL, and that I was to travel the following morning at eight o'clock, which means yesterday morning at 8 a.m. So I prepared my luggage. I did everything I had to do, following the calendar that had been given to me. But unfortunately, my suitcase was lost along the way, and the airline ensures me that my suitcase will arrive today or tomorrow. So all my luggage, all my documents have been lost and the proof is that the airline recognised that the luggage hadn't accompanied me. I made a claim for the documents to come as soon as possible.As regards the document in question, I have a copy of it in my luggage, which I hope to recover today or at the latest tomorrow. </p>

The Trial Chamber decided that you would only testify today as a witness of fact, and not as an expert witness. That was the decision.

But now you are informing me of a decision. I work very often with written documents. I cannot say that I have been seized of the decision because I haven't been notified in writing. I consider that, as I was contacted in writing, I must be disqualified in writing, and this other status thus offered me, should also have been notified to me in writing. </p>

            <p>Well, as I said, Madam President, a document such as this, drafted by Judges, I need to read it, I need to consult. I have to work out the implications, because I have another one sent to me by the same Tribunal, so I want to compare them. "We have decided to offer you on behalf of the Registrar of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, an assignment on the consultant contact as an expert witness for the required preliminary work." Now, if we are going to change, I need to compare, and I have the right, I believe, to take advice, unless I am very much mistaken. So a document such as this, of which people have spent many days, hours and hours working out what they are going to write down, I can't do it in five minutes nor an hour and 20 minutes. I do not feel capable of answering without having worked out the implications of this document. </p>

            <p>Your Honours, I realise we are pressed for time, and we have wasted the last half hour over a matter that is au fait accompli. You ruled on the 11th of November and reinforced your ruling yesterday, that the witness in the box isn't an expert. Neither he nor his counsel can take it any further. The mere fact that he was accredited by the Registrar as an expert, in itself, is just for purposes of remuneration, and has no bearing on the finding of this Chamber when qualifying the witness. I refer Your Honours to Article II of the guidelines on the remuneration of expert witnesses appearing before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and I quote: " Obviously, it is the right of the Trial Chamber to allow the witness to make a deposition as an expert on special issues referred to it or tear the witness's testimony and where necessary, assess its value. However, the conditions defined under the UN Financial and Accounting Rules and Procedures, require the submission of the expert witness's references, as well as evidence of his expertise, to the Registrar to back up any request for payment of his fees or reimbursement of any expenditure incurred by him". The point I am underscoring, Your Honours, is that the mere fact that he was accredited as an expert by the Registrar, does not impact on your decision of the 11th of November, and we should be moving on, considering that we are pressed for time and we have lost the last half hour. </p>

            <p>Mr. Prosecutor, I think the issue here at the present time is -- apparently this is the first intimation this witness has heard that he has not been accepted as an expert witness, and I think he needs to elect whether in the circumstances he still wants to give evidence. It may well be that after he has read the order of this Court, the ruling of this Court, he may choose not to wish to give evidence. And I think for that purpose, he needs time as he says, to read and understand why he is being disqualified. </p>

            <p>It could have been made easier if the Chamber just told him that -- you know, in bullet point form, that he has been disqualified and give him the option, because reading that decision or not won't take matters any further. The question should be posed: Does he want to testify or not, considering paragraph 9 and the orders in that decision? Most obliged, Your Honours. </p>

            <p>Madam President, I think objectively speaking, the Prosecutor is extending the logic of his reasoning a bit far. I already -- I don't understand this. The difficult situation in which we are is because of the Prosecution. The witness raises a problem before the Trial Chamber. The Trial Chamber is looking for a solution, and the Prosecutor bursts in. Very respectfully, Madam President, there should be differences between the Prosecution and us is perfectly normal. But a witness who comes here to testify must be left the time to decide what to do or not. There was a decision on the 11th. The gentleman has just been informed that the decision was taken on the 11th affecting him, and the Prosecutor is following a logic which is -- something I have not seen somewhere. You remember he said something on Monday, the 17th, at three o'clock. I said that if the Prosecutor has an objection, he should raise a motion, an application whether oral or written, but the problem is raised before the Trial Chamber. It is to the Trial Chamber to take the decision and the Defence has introduced the witness cannot do anything about it. Always we are reminded that we must be expeditious -- and all the time you are pushing people, and I don't think that is normal. Madam, I think the fact that we don't often interrupt is a bit not out of weakness, but because out of knowledge and respect for legal proceedings. We should like the Prosecution to also follow those rules, otherwise it is not normal. We are doing all we can to end this trial within the allotted time. I have been running across town three times to the Impala because of the Prosecution. We know how things should be done. I am very sorry for speaking the way I do, but I think it's a third day of repetition. We should nonetheless, in the heat of action sometimes be allowed to commit some mistakes. But I beg the Prosecutor to remember this so that we can move forward -- so as to move forward, Madam President. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Yes. I shall be very brief. I shall be very brief, Madam President. In fact, I should have added that it is torture for me. I have just learned from the driver that we were arriving at 0900, but the itinerary worked out a week ago indicated that I was supposed to arrive at 13:25 or 1:25. I arrived at about 2 p.m. at the airport. At 2:45 I arrived at the hotel. I was told I must come to testify, and for someone who has lost his luggage, for me, it is torture. And I merely wanted to draw that to your attention, because when I said, "Give me at least a minute to wash my face", I was told, "No. No, you have to go to the Tribunal." I wanted to point this incident and to bring this incident to your notice. So whoever said I was supposed to arrive at nine this morning, didn't know anything about it; it's another lie being slipped in amongst all the others, as usual. I was never due to arrive at nine this morning.</p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, if I acted in precipitation, I will be rendering a misservice, both to the Trial Chamber and to the Accused. Since we met yesterday, only 17 hours have elapsed, and I think this amount of time was not enough for me to make a statement in a context for which I did not prepare myself. So, if you prefer that the few hours that are still remaining are not essential, then I decline the offer, and it is for you to make a ruling. So, in any case, I do not want to act in precipitation. I have to consult people, and I believe that is my right. In short, I do not want to act in a hurry, in a rush, in precipitation. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Your Honours. On 6 November this year, my colleague of the witnesses' protection section centre by electronic message mentioned to Professor Ndengejeho to make sure of his availability for the purpose of him coming here to give testimony before the Court. For this reason, my colleague expressed the wish that he, Professor Ndengejeho, should confirm his availability. On the 7th of November, the section once more, by telephone, contacted Professor Ndengejeho, who informed the section that he will not be present from the 12th to the 17th of November in his country of residence and that, consequently, he will not be in a position to undertake a trip to Arusha before 21 November, the reason being that from 18 November, his students had to defend their theses. We, in this regard, prepared a note or a memo. On that same 7 November, Professor Ndengejeho contacted our section to tell us that he has reviewed his timetable and that he confirms that he will be absent from his country of residence from 10 to 12 November and that he could undertake a journey to Arusha on the 18th of November, that he was going to be absent from the 12th to the 17th from his country of residence. Our section immediately took the necessary steps in order to obtain the itinerary of his trip and to propose same to Professor Ndengejeho. Thus, we proposed to him two routes. Following the discussion that he had with my colleague, Professor Ndengejeho preferred to take the following itinerary or route. So he had to leave his country of residence at 8:50 in the morning to be in Dar es Salaam at 7 p.m., and the following day to leave Dar es Salaam at 8:30 so as to be at Arusha airport at 9:45 a.m.As soon as the decision of the Trial Chamber concerning Professor Ndengejeho was delivered on 11 November 2003, our section was served with a copy of that decision, and it is that decision that enabled us to relaunch the travel arrangements, to make the necessary arrangements so that Professor Ndengejeho received his travel ticket as soon as possible. It is proper to note that we still had only three working days, namely, the 12th, the 13th and the 14th of November, and the 14th of November was a Friday. Consequently, the travel company, which is in Arusha but which has a parent company in Nairobi, immediately sent a ticket by DHL to the address that Professor Ndengejeho gave us, without nevertheless giving us a copy of that air ticket. Therefore, the air ticket was sent by DHL on 17th November. On Monday, we called Professor Ndengejeho as soon as he had returned from his conference, to have confirmation from him that he had effectively received the air ticket, the air ticket which had been sent to him by DHL. Initially, he informed my colleague of the fact that he had not received the DHL-sent ticket. But I personally called his office, and the office informed me that the DHL parcel had been delivered. My colleague contacted him once again, that he should contact his office so as to collect the DHL parcel which contained his air ticket. He did that. Following that, he had to undertake his journey, start his journey, on 18 November, in the morning, at 8:50 as envisaged. At about nine o'clock, 9:30 a.m., my colleague informed me that Professor Ndengejeho missed his plane and that, consequently, it was necessary to take other steps in order to make him take the next flight. This is what we did at our level in Arusha, and this is what enabled Professor Ndengejeho to take the flight of eleven o'clock. Mr. Ndengejeho arrived in Dar es Salaam on that same day. We were not able to contact him, first of all, to have confirmation that indeed he had taken the flight from his country of residence, and consequently to confirm that he was on the flight, headed for Arusha. What we did was to contact once more the travel agency used by the Tribunal to make sure of the hour when he was going to arrive. The hour we were given was 9:45 a.m., that he was going to arrive in Arusha at 9:45 a.m. We sent our colleagues to the Arusha airport so as to pick up Professor Ndengejeho. To our great surprise, he was not on the flight, and this is what led us to inform the Defence team that Professor Ndengejeho was not on the flight, therefore, that he had not arrived at 9:45 a.m.Consequently, we contacted the travel agency once more, which told us that he was certainly going to be on the second flight and that, under the circumstances, they could not give us all the details because it was necessary for people to start boarding the plane for them to have the final version of the passenger list. Thus, yesterday, at about 1:30 -- or, rather, 12:30 in the afternoon, we had the information that Professor Ndengejeho's name was on the passenger list. And if I'm not mistaken, at 25 past 1:00, my colleagues received him at the airport. He informed us that he did not have his baggage with him, that he was not able to collect his baggage from the flight coming from Johannesburg. So, this is what we have to say concerning the travel of Mr. Ndengejeho. This morning, my colleagues returned to the airport to make sure that they collected Professor Ndengejeho's baggage, and they did so. The baggage was given to us. He mentioned that his bag had been damaged and that, consequently, it would be necessary for the Tribunal to replace that damaged bag. But we took alternative measures because we do not have any budgetary provision to replace damaged bags. What we did was, we asked our colleague to go to the company, to inform the airline that it was their responsibility to replace the travel bag which had been damaged. The processes on the airline would make sure that they replaced the damaged bag of Professor Ndengejeho. Between these two acts, yesterday in the afternoon, after Professor Ndengejeho received -- was received within the premises of the Tribunal for the purpose of his giving testimony, in the evening our section, or, at least, a representative of our section, went to the hotel where Professor Ndengejeho is lodged. This was at my request. The purpose of this was to serve -- or, rather, give a copy of the report. The reason for this is simple. The reason is that Professor Ndengejeho yesterday was not in possession of his baggage. The section therefore was of the view that it was necessary for him to be able to take cognizance of his report. This report which we gave to Professor Ndengejeho, we obtained it from the coordinator of Trial Chamber III. It is a report which is in English -- which is in English. Before giving the report, I made sure that I contacted Mr. Kouengoua to inform him of our intention, the intention of our section, to go and serve that report on Professor Ndengejeho. But Mr. Kouengoua did not object to what we intended to do. My colleague therefore went to the hotel where Professor Ndengejeho was lodged, to serve on him the report. Professor Ndengejeho took the report, just opened the envelope, and felt that the report was not his report and that, consequently, he would not take it -- he would not accept the report. Moreover, he asked my colleague to kindly sign a note to the effect that the report in question was not the proper report and that he, Professor Ndengejeho, refused to take the report. My colleague did that, but in that note my colleague added that our section was only facilitating the Tribunal's work; it was not our responsibility to decide whether or not it is compulsory for him to take cognizance of the report served on him. While my colleague was still with Professor Ndengejeho, I suppose at about 9 p.m. yesterday, I chatted with Professor Ndengejeho, and during that conversation, Professor Ndengejeho made me understand that it was not his wish to take possession of that report, and I told him that we're simply facilitating the work of the Tribunal and that, consequently, we take proper note of his refusal, we take due note of his refusal to collect the report and that henceforth I would give instructions to my colleague to return to her home. Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-ndengejeho">
            <speaker>WITNESS NDENGEJEHO:</speaker>
            <p>Of course, Madam President, I have something to say. First of all, I believe Sylvie is making a confusion about certain hours and facts. I have here, Madam President, Your Honours -- with your leave, you can look at the reservation that was made on the 12th of November. What Sylvie is saying, it is they who did it, it is her service who did this reservation. I even have the original of the reservation, and the ticket is here. You can refer to it. I have never heard anyone talk about nine o'clock. The document is here if you want to have a look at it. It shows you the reservations made by the Tribunal, and that reservation stipulates that on the 19th I had to leave Dar es Salaam at 12:30 in the afternoon and to arrive here at 25 minutes past 1:00. I am not the one who wrote the document. Now, there is some slight confusion regarding the hours and the dates. It happens that on the 17th I arrived at Windhoek, and before leaving I had requested that documents be transferred to my office because -- that they should be transferred to my office by DHL. I arrived at Windhoek at about eleven o'clock in my office and realised that there was no document concerning the air ticket, nor the visa. Therefore, it is for this reason that I phoned the Tribunal, telling them that I do not have any document. After that, I went to rest. It had been five days that I had been facing a difficult task which consisted of attending a conference in South Africa. I went to rest, and at about three o'clock, I was awoken by a telephone call, a telephone call from -- a telephone call from Mrs. Becky's colleague, telling me that documents had been sent to my office in the afternoon. Indeed, I went to my office and realised that the secretary had received the documents, but nevertheless there was no visa, and I was told that documents relating to the visa were sent by scanned message but a scanned message up to the 18th. At 9:30, when I was leaving the office, I did not receive the message. I asked the colleague of Mrs. Becky to send the message to me by fax. The fax arrived after 4:30. I have it, I can prove that. Now, the following day, I brought the fax to the airport. I was told that there was doubt as to the authenticity of the fax. They helped me for some time, so much so that I missed my flight, but I decided to take the next flight so that from South Africa I would not have any other changes to make. So, Madam President, with regard to this document, I believe this document is proof, and this was sent by Tribunal, and it is indicated 1:25 on that document. I would like to point out, Madam President, Your Honours, with regard to such sabotage -- because I didn't know that they had tried to look for me. It's one of her colleagues who went to the airport and found out that my bag had been cut in the middle, and it is that colleague who observed this, and he -- and she asked that the company should pay for the bag. I am very, very surprised to hear that I asked the Tribunal to reimburse the cost of the bag. I believe the person who went to the airport is here and can confirm that I did not ask the Tribunal to reimburse money. All I asked was that the person should go to the travel agency and find out whether they could give me another appropriate bag, because I couldn't use that to travel with. As regards the value, I said it wasn't important, and I said I was even ready to pay 25 or 30 dollars in losses because I had to travel soon. That is what I wanted to say. The last thing is that somebody came to the hotel at 10:30 p.m., somebody I didn't know, and this person gave me a document of about -- of less than a hundred pages, and the person said it was a translation of my report. And I said, "How can a document that was 220 pages long be reduced to less than a hundred pages? Was it a miracle?" And that is why I told this man, "It can't be my document." The pages I read show that it wasn't my document. So I said, "In any case, give me the document; I'll read through it. If I find that it is authentic, I will sign tomorrow. But if I find it is another trap that has been set for me, I will return the document to you." And that is what happened yesterday, at 10:30. You can understand that somebody who had just arrived, who was tired, could not have the presence of mind to read through the hundred or so pages, and that is what happened. But, with your permission, Madam President, I would like to hand over this document to you so that you can go through it. It is an original, and you'll find that it is -- what I'm saying is true.</p>

            <p>Madam President, I am very surprised and in a fix, and I would like the Chamber to place things in context. Madam President, I am aware of the decisions of the 11th of November and the 17th of November. The only thing I would like to know has to do with the dialogue between the witness and Madam President. I would like to know whether it is the expert witness who is refusing to testify or the factual witness. This is the point I would like the Chamber to clarify, Madam President, because I do not quite understand what the situation is. Please, could you kindly clarify that matter? </p>

            <p>Personally, I believe what I said is clear. I came here as an expert witness. I heard yesterday, at about 4:30, that I was no longer recognised as an expert witness, and I was informed that I would eventually testify as a factual witness. And bearing in mind a note that was given to me, I requested time to consult certain people who are involved in this case and who would be in a position to allow me to testify as a factual witness. With all the time that was given to me and which were after office hours, I was not in a position to consult everyone. I would have loved to consult at least one person before testifying -- at least nine people before testifying. I only managed to consult four people. Two of these people are dead. I would have loved to have a few more hours, even if that were to bring us to 9 a.m. tomorrow morning, and that would give me time to decide whether to testify or not. The decision not to testify -- the decision that I'm not ready to testify is not mine. I came here to testify. I would like you to note that the person who was supposed to come and testify effectively appeared before you and -- as I did before I testified, and I'm not the one who has refused to testify; it is Madam President who is stating that I am not ready to testify. That decision is not mine.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. In view of what has just happened, unfortunately, Madam President, I am obliged to file a few oral motions to this august Chamber as part of the continuation of the trial. Madam President, Your Honours, I had filed for the Chamber's consideration, after disclosure to the Prosecutor, the list of evidential documents and the list of my witnesses and expert witnesses. Amongst those expert witnesses, Madam President, there were two forensic experts and an expert witness. The expert witness was Pascal Ndengejeho. Madam President, when I disclosed this list following the commencement of Gacumbitsi's trial on the 28th of July, my Defence strategy was built around that arrangement. Today, Madam President, following your decision, and in view of what Mr. Ndengejeho has just told the Chamber and the conclusions that have been drawn by the Chamber, I note simply, and I would request the Chamber to note as well, that Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre's Defence does not have any expert witnesses, whereas it had proposed an expert witness. Madam President, the Prosecutor, during the tendering of his Prosecution evidence from the 26th of July -- 28th of July to the 26th of August, and the Defence, in its Defence strategy, had envisaged challenging the evidence presented by the Prosecutor and we had intended to use these experts. Today, Madam President, the Defence finds itself in an unbalanced situation. That is why I would request the Chamber, pursuant to Rules 20, paragraphs <stage>(1),</stage>
              <stage>(2)</stage> and <stage>(4)</stage> of the Statute -- that is Article 20 of the Statute and Rules 73 <stage>(A)</stage> and 73 ter of the Rules and regulations of the Chamber, that the Defence of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi should be authorised to call another expert witness in order to -- for purposes of equality of arms. I believe, Madam President, that in so doing you would have rendered fair and balanced justice and the rights of the Defence would have been safeguarded. Because as I stated in one of my preceding motions, the Judge holds the balance between the two parties. Indeed, you are the balance between the two parties, and when there is an imbalance, you have to rectify it to uphold justice. Expert witness Alison Des Forges testified on the 26th and the 28th of August 2003 before your Chamber. Who is the Defence's expert witness, Madam President? He is not there, and this is a clear handicap, and I believe this is clear to the Chamber as well. And that is why I would request, pursuant to the legal provisions I've just stated, that is, the Articles of the Statute and Rules 73 <stage>(A)</stage> and 73 ter of the Rules, to allow the Defence to call an expert witness for equality of arms. In so doing, Madam President, I believe it would be fair justice. This is the motion I wanted to file before you now. I thank you for your attention. </p>

            <p>The Chamber finds that the balance that the Defence has just spoken of, the balance between the parties, is not mathematical, because you had two forensic experts and the Prosecutor had one, and if we go by the number of witnesses, you called 20; the Prosecutor called less. We consider that it is the duty of the parties to choose their experts. You chose your expert, and this choice -- and it is unfortunately your expert witness who refused to testify. Even though we did not recognise him as an expert witness, we believe that -- by taking note of -- taking notice of your witness's refusal to testify before this Chamber, we had not in any way disrupted the balance between both parties, and for this reason, we deny your motion, Counsel Kouengoua. We would now like to know whether the Accused will testify before this Chamber or not, since certain measures have to be taken in this regard as well.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam President, Your Lordships, for your patience. I think that the examination-in-chief might take three hours, maximum; three hours maximum.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So we will do as follows. We will sit tomorrow, because after the examination-in-chief, there will be cross-examination, and it is quite possible that the Judges might have questions to put to the defendant, and we only have Monday afternoon, because we're not sure that we can sit on Tuesday, which might be a public holiday. We were told that Tuesday or Wednesday will be a public holiday, because there is an Islamic holiday which is observed at the United Nations. So that is an additional difficulty. So we are ready, for our part, to sit tomorrow, so we can sit tomorrow and Monday afternoon. In that way, we'll be sure to get through what we have to do in time.</p>

            <p>Well, that's what I'm telling you. Tuesday is the 25th, which is the lunar feast. So either the 25th or the 26th, depending on the phase of the moon, the observation of the moon. So we were told initially that the 27th would be the public holiday, but Ramadan started earlier this year, so the end of Ramadan could be the 25th or the 26th, so we have to finish on the 24th.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>No. Please, Madam, if Tuesday is a public holiday, that means that the examination-in-chief would take place on the Monday, and then the cross-examination could be held on Wednesday.</p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>

            <p>Madam President, Your Lordships, under such conditions, if Tuesday you are not available, which might be the case for Muslims, but then let's at least sit on Monday from 1430 to 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. so Tuesday everybody can rest. And that wouldn't be an exception, because in other Trial Chambers they also work late in the evening.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>We're very sorry, but in any case you've had quite enough time to prepare the defendant. We might even have told you we want to hear him immediately. We're leaving you until tomorrow. We, ourselves, are giving up a day, but everybody has to put their oar in because we have to finish on the Tuesday at the latest. I'm very sorry, Tuesday is the time by which we must finish. I'm sorry, but we've lost too much time.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam, with all due respect, I have in no way benefited from this time available because of all that has been going on. If really we had finished on the 31st of October, as we planned, I would not be asking for a single minute or a single hour. Please -- and my programme provided for two expert witnesses on Monday, the 17th. That was the programme I had submitted, and that was the way the programme was established. Please, madam, in the documents that we have in writing and that were given to us by the Trial Chamber, the trial was to end on the 30th of November. When you get information like that, you organise yourself accordingly. Now I find myself faced with a decision because I'm asking for tomorrow because I can't go to UNDF on Sunday or Saturday, and then Monday we can finish. I think I'm conscious of the situation.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>I'm very sorry, but if you're going to take three hours for examination-in-chief, the Prosecution has the right to cross-examine also and the Judges have their questions to put. Why do you keep us here until nine o'clock at night on Monday if we can work tomorrow? It is much more logical than what you're telling us. I'm very sorry.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, what I think I would rather do to satisfy the requirements of the Trial Chamber is to shorten the examination of my client.</p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>You can shorten, yes. If you tell us that one hour is enough, then perhaps we could try to do everything on Monday.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I think it might be better. Fine. For us, for the Defence, it is desirable that we start on Monday.</p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So you need -- you'll take one hour to examine the defendant? Because this must be a commitment.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Well, madam, if the Accused appears as a Defence witness and we only take one hour, who would have the rest of the time? It is up to me to have the most of the time.Your Honours are, of course, free to seek any clarification, but for once, the Defence should be favoured. If I take only one hour out of three, the Prosecution might take up the two and a half remaining hours. </p>

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>No, it's not bargaining. I could do it in perhaps two and a half, but I would like it to be on Monday.</p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>No, I'm sorry, you cannot ask that of us. I told you, we are available to sit tomorrow, to leave you enough time. Now, if you want to reduce the duration of the examination -- reduce the duration of the examination-in-chief of your witness, you can reduce it, but not to two and a half hours. That doesn't solve the problem.</p>

            <p>The studies I did were quite out of the ordinary. At the time when I went to school, it was -- everyone was not accustomed to going to school. When I was of school age, there was a sub-chief named Kalkabarani <stage>(phonetic),</stage> in the Kigina secteur. He came to our house and he told my father that I had to go to school, because he didn't want to see any children who didn't go to school. My father heeded his advice and enrolled me in school. In our secteur, there was only one school establishment, and only one child went to school at a time, and after school he came back home. The primary school was in Nyarubuye. After the first year in school, I was still very young, and I followed schoolmates who were older than me to go and study in Nyarubuye parish, about 30 kilometres from our home. So I had to be sheltered somewhere, I had to look for my food myself, fend for myself, and that is what I did. God helped me and I completed my studies. In 1956, I passed the national exam, which enabled me to be admitted in the boarding section of the school. I succeeded very well in that exam. I went to study in Rwaza, in Ruhengeri préfecture. But I had problems. We were poor. My mother did not have the means to send me to school, and she told me, "Come back home. There is nothing else we can do." But the parish priest in Nyarubuye parish was the director of studies in the school, as well, as -- and the sub-chief whom I mentioned earlier came to our home, and they said, "This child should pursue his studies in secondary school." My mother said, "It is not possible. I am poor." And they answered saying, "We understand all that. You are poor. But the child should not be a victim of this situation. The world of today requires that children should go to school." And I was exempted from paying school fees. However, I had to find transportation charges up to Rwaza, in Ruhengeri préfecture where I went. I had to study. My mother accepted that, and she said, "I will do everything to ensure you get there. Whenever you, yourselves, can, please help me." I went to study in Rwaza. I spent a year in boarding school. And at the end of the first year, I passed the end-of-course exam and this gave me access to Byumba school, where I went to seven year, which is known as the preparatory year, and after that year, I went to the École normale, and I pursued my studies there. In 1963, I graduated with a teacher's certificate, and I started working as a teacher. This is my academic background.</p>

Then, I believe it was in 1970-1971, I was sent on further training, where I spent one year, and upon my return from the further training course, I continued teaching. With time, the Rusumo commune created what was referred to as the Banque populaire, the People's Bank. The People's Bank was under the control of another bank in Kigali.

            <p>In the 1960s, that commune was not called Rusumo. It was called Kigina. Later on, there was a merger of certain communes. The Nyarubuye commune was split into two. Part of it was attached to the Kigina commune and the other part to the Rukira commune. Kigina, and part of Nyarubuye, together, were now named Rusumo. This was, I believe, in 1961. In 1994, Rusumo commune had lakes in the north, the lakes called Tanasho <stage>(phonetic),</stage> and the Akagera river, which crosses that lake, and goes towards Uganda. The Akagera is at the same time the border between Tanzania and Rusumo commune, which shares a border with Rwanda. In the southeast, the Akagera river continues. Once more it serves as the border with Burundi in the southwest. In the southwest, there is the Birenga commune, whereas in the west, you have the Rukira commune. These are the borders of the Rusumo commune. I do not know whether you want to have some other information on the commune. I have just given you the borders of the commune.</p>

            <p>Yes, Witness. I asked you whether you could introduce your commune to the Trial Chamber. That is the surface area, the population and so on. You are supposed to know that commune. </p>

          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you very much. Since the commune became Rusumo, it became very vast. It had 9,000 -- 68,000 square kilometres, and it has ten secteurs -- 968,000 square kilometres. The commune comprises a number of zones. For example, you have the Kibungo zone, which comprises several secteurs, the Nyarubuye secteur, which is very big, the Nyakabungo <stage>(phonetic)</stage> secteur, as well as the Nyabitare secteur. You also have the Bihuya <stage>(phonetic)</stage> zone, which comprises the Kigina secteur, Kirehe, Gatore, Musaza as well as Kigarama. Then you also have the zone referred to as the cuvette zone. This is a basin, the Akagera basin. This zone comprises very big secteurs, in particular that of Nyamugali and that of Gisenyi. All these secteurs are subdivided into cellules. Rusumo commune comprised a hundred cellules. What I can say in addition, with regard to Rusumo, is that Rusumo commune had a population on the basis of the general census of 1991, that is the census of 15 of August 1991 -- according to the figures of that census, Rusumo commune had a population of over 120,000 inhabitants. In April 1994, the number of people increased; the population was about 140,000 inhabitants. What else can I say? Well, for a long time, the Rusumo commune was only inhabited in the high hills. In the valleys, you had only forests where you could find wild animals. People lived on the highlands of the commune. There are préfectures that are highly populated, like Butare, Ruhengeri, which were overpopulated, and the members of the population did not have farms to cultivate. In 1967-68, somewhere there about, the state created what they called "paysanat," small holdings, and the small holdings were constituted in such a way that pieces of land were shared. People from other préfectures were brought and settled in those small holdings. The Rusumo holdings comprised Nyamugali and Gisenyi. The Rusumo préfecture was very vast and fertile. A lot of sorghum was produced there, as well as cassava, groundnut. In fact, people wanted to settle there so as to be able to do farming. The first settlers were brought there by the state and an organisation called IDR. It is an NGO. That NGO developed a small farm holdings in collaboration with the state. Later on, other people came on their own initiative, following their close relatives, and they settled where land was available. The state gave them the land. The state would give them a piece of land, and the report would be sent to us. The bourgmestre would write to the native commune of the new settlers so that those communes should send their information concerning them to our commune so that we should be able to register them in our commune and thus enable them to vote like any other person. Several préfectures, Kibuye, Butare, Kigali, even Kibungo -- there are people from Kibungo who left their places of origin to come and settle in Rusumo because the land in Rusumo was very fertile. That is how the population increased. I can also say, with regard to Rusumo, that in 1982, a number of persons who had taken refuge in Uganda, Milton Obote, one of the Ugandan presidents, sent them away, told them, "Go back to your place, Rwanda." These same refugees crossed the Mutara, which is in Rwanda, and the Rwandan state looked for ways and means of resettling them. Most of these former refugees came to Rusumo. They were settled in -- or resettled in Rusumo. And it is the NGO called Africa -- or rather Africare, the NGO called Africare, it is that NGO which created villages. It created villages for these refugees who had come from Rwanda in 1982, '83. The refugees were settled in a modern manner, in -- or, rather, on lands well developed. There were five villages that were created: The Rushoka village, Ehutu <stage>(phonetic),</stage> Rubaya -- Rubaya, and Nyabubare and Ebande <stage>(phonetic)</stage> villages. All these villages were known as Nasho. They are located in a broad sector known as Kankobwa. In a few words, that is the presentation of Rusumo commune, as far as I could describe it in 1994. </p>

I opened the letter, and on reading the letter, I was very surprised. It was said in the letter that, "You, Gacumbitsi, you have become the bourgmestre of Rusumo." I was very surprised to become bourgmestre. I had never thought of becoming bourgmestre. Thus I became bourgmestre, with this letter from the president of the republic.

I should like to point out that the indictment is essentially in his capacity as bourgmestre and chairman of the MRND in Rusumo commune that all the rest befall him, and there is no one else who can explain these points apart from than himself, so I think we have to go into this to be able to make an essential appreciation of the individual who is before you. It is in that sense that I am proceeding in this way and not for any other reason, but because I feel that it is essential to -- for understanding.

            <p>I am sorry, I don't understand what we are talking about. The witness mentioned an attack in 1990, on Byumba in 1990 and an attack on Nasho. Nasho is shared between Rukira and Rusumo communes in 1991. And he said that it did not last because it was repulsed by soldiers coming from Mulindi, and I asked the question whether Mulindi is in Rusumo commune, and he said no, Mulindi is in Rukira commune, but Nasho is shared between Rukira and Rusumo communes. I don't know whether that satisfies the Prosecution, unless there is something I was not clear about. </p>

            <p>On this point, I thank you. I'm sorry, if I said 1994, or if it heard -- if it came from me, it was a slip of the tongue. Or it is a mistake someone made down the line. But I was not talking about 1994. I'm not here to suggest answers. I'm only -- the witness has only mentioned 1990 and 1991. I never said that there was any attack in 1994, and I don't think that anything has been said about 1994 so far. I hope -- thank you for drawing the attention to this confusion. I'm sorry. I did not realise it, and I should like it to be corrected, if such was the case. </p>

            <p>The Kirehe sub-préfecture was established in 1983. It was made up of two communes, Rukira and Rusumo. The sub-préfectural office was in Kirehe in Rusumo commune.

            <p>When you say it is the bourgmestre at the head of the commune, it doesn't mean that it is he that is in charge of all activities. There are conseillers, there were responsables, so there are various levels. There is the communal council, composed of the bourgmestre himself and the conseillers, councillors. There is a committee of experts, the technical committee, which studies communal projects. There is also the communal development council. So there is the communal council, consisting of the technical committee. And when the members of that committee meet, there is what you call the heads of technical departments at communal level. And when all these people get together in a meeting, that is called the communal development council. All those people, therefore, are responsible for the development of the commune. Those three councils are responsible for the development of the council, and the three councils are responsible for the administration of the commune.</p>

There was an assistant bourgmestre, who was a Tutsi, deputy bourgmestre. My driver, the communal driver, was Tutsi. There were Tutsi agronomists, Hitiyise, Birasa, Kanyogote; they were all Tutsi who were administrators in -- at various levels in communal administration. In the schooling, there were several Tutsi teachers. They were very numerous. You also mentioned the political parties. I can tell you -- name some representatives of political parties. Nutabarungu, he was a Tutsi. He was deputy bourgmestre, a member of MRND, and he was deputy bourgmestre. There was Birasa, who was a member of the PL party. Faustin Ndabikunze also belonged to PL. The accountant, communal accountant, now I'm talking of a Hutu. There are various -- do you want me to give you other names or only Tutsi names or others?

            <p>You see, there was the RPF who wanted to take power in Rwanda, and there was the government that was the government in place. So the sharing of power was to take place on the basis of the accords negotiated here in Arusha. We were delighted, because the population did not want people to continue dying. So, for us, it was something very encouraging, very important. As and until the accords were signed in August 1993, we were very happy. We thought the situation would come back to normal. In other words, we thought that Rwanda would be at peace and the RPF and the government in place would share power.</p>

I told them I was going to attend a meeting in Kibongo. And they told me I could not pass. And I asked them, "How? How come? I am the bourgmestre of Rusumo commune". And when they had ascertained that what I was saying was true, they allowed me to pass. And they said anybody ought to stay at home, nobody is supposed to move about. "And why are you going -- where are you going?" So I spoke to the authorities and I told them I was the bourgmestre of Rusumo, I was going to a meeting, please let me pass and they allowed me to pass.

            <p>The decisions arrived at that meeting were as follows -- or, rather, they were broadcast over national radio. And those decisions had to do with instructions to the bourgmestres to make sure they ensured security, they provided for the security in their communes. They had to organise security meetings, several security meetings, particularly in secteurs that were encountering -- that were the scene of disturbances. They had to organise meetings aimed at ensuring reconciliation between members of the population. Displaced persons had to come back. The bourgmestres had to do their best to resettle them in their homes, and in a peaceful manner. We also decided that curfews were to be instituted and was supposed to start from 6 p.m. -- from6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Members of the population had to organise night rounds in an organised manner, and these night rounds were to be led by members of communities in the cellules or other designated persons. The choice of these people did not have to be discriminatory on racial grounds or on grounds of -- on political lines. All members of the population had to take part in these night rounds in order to provide for the security of the population. And if ever any individuals disturbed public order, they had to be referred to the public authorities and punished accordingly. Members of the security committee of the cellule had to decide to move about to visit the areas where disturbances were occurring and to assist communal authorities in organising meetings aimed at reconciling members of the population. This was a commitment which the préfectural security committee had to take. We also decided that all kinds of banditry had to be forbidden. We were aware of the fact that certain individuals, under the pretext of the president's death, or people encountering difficulties, were attacking shops to loot goods, and we decided that the traders had the right or the responsibility to organise themselves to protect their goods in order to prevent such criminals from stealing their property. These are the decisions that were taken at the meeting and that were passed down to the people over the national radio.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I think this is an open session. The Accused is giving testimony in his language. If the witness was not in agreement with what the counsel is saying, he would have objected. He has not said anything, he has no reacted, so I supposed that the Accused is not opposed to me filing this document as Defence exhibit. On the contrary, the person who to object to it is the Prosecutor. I believe that if the Prosecutor does not object to the document being admitted into evidence since he has identified the document as coming from his office, logically, this means that this document should be admitted into the records, Madam President. Unless, the witness, if he has enough strength to read it. Well, I do not object to the Accused reading the document. I personally would not be uncomfortable with that if the Accused wishes to read the document, except that by so doing we should also take into consideration what is on the wall. </p>

            <p>Subsequently, I knew the reasons why he was absent. At the end of the meeting someone came and informed me that the conseiller in question was unable to attend the meeting because he had to solve a problem concerning one of his subjects who had a security problem. And while he was solving that problem, he was late. And even I, after the meeting, I went there to find out what happened, and the conseiller in question explained me what a happened. I confirmed that it was not acceptable for acts of violence to be committed against anyone under the pretext that the president of the republic had been killed. So I confirmed that. So after the meeting which I chaired, I went to the place.</p>

            <p>People from the Gisenyi secteur had committed acts of injustice against someone who had been accused of being an accomplice of the RPF. They told the conseiller that they had suspicions regarding that person. They wanted to commit acts of violence against him, and when I arrived, I confirmed what the conseiller had just stated by saying that it was unacceptable to threaten anyone or to commit any acts of injustice against anyone under the pretext that that person was an accomplice of the RPF.</p>

Pierre told me, "Do you know that the situation in that place is not good? I believe that someone wants to -- someone is about to be hurt wrongly."

            <p>I wanted security to reign throughout the Rusumo commune but, unfortunately, that was not the case. There was an incident which greatly saddened me. It occurred in the night of the 9th to the 10th. The house of a certain Birasa of the Nyamugali secteur was torched, was burnt. So the conseiller sent someone to tell me that the house had been burnt. I immediately brought the matter to the attention of the prosecutor's office. I asked the prosecutor's assistant to accompany me, to accompany me to the place. It was the prosecutor in the Kirehe commune. I told him that if he was busy doing something else he should accompany me. He accepted, so we went to the Rumugali secteur <stage>(phonetic)</stage> to take stock of the situation. When we arrived there we met the conseiller who was holding a meeting. And, indeed, the house had been burnt but the owner of the house had fled. So the conseiller had gathered the members of the population for the purpose of carrying out an investigation. We helped in the investigation in order to be able to identify the culprits. We asked him to continue with the investigation and to inform us of the outcome thereof because we were going to see what security situation was in other localities. We went to the Gisenyi secteur and also other villages which I mentioned earlier. We went there to find out what the security situation was. We moved about, and on return, the conseiller told me that the investigation had not ended. So this is the incident which took place, that is the house which was burnt and the situation saddened me greatly. It occurred on the 10th.</p>

            <p>I had difficulties bringing the situation under control in that secteur. Moreover, the same group which torched the house of Birasa, which group had not been identified, that same group in the night of 10th to 11th April, torched other houses, burnt other houses. They burnt the house of a certain Pierre Karemera, and a certain Karanganwa, nicknamed Kiki. I was aware -- I became aware of this the following day, the 11th. It was a Monday and I informed the assistant prosecutor. I asked him to assist me so that we go and verify the situation that prevailed in the Nyamugali secteur. We carried out a short investigation. We went to Karemera's house. We went to Karanganwa, alias Kiki, and we carried out an investigation. A young man called Gashambagara told us, "I'm going to tell you what happened. Look for a certain Kamenyero. It is his group that is responsible for this act". We looked for the Kamenyero who named other people, and we arrested them. After their arrest -- there were people who had been injured in Kamenyero's house. Sisters took them -- some reverend sisters took them to Kibongo hospital, and I arrested the criminals. I took them to the market square Nyamugali. This was the market day; it as a certain Monday. I held a meeting in Nyamugali, and the people who had come to the market attended the meeting and also people in the neighbourhood. I held a security meeting. I told them what happened in their secteurs; I told them what happened in Birasa's house and also in Karemera's house, as well as Kiki's house. I clearly underscored that I would not want such criminals to continue perpetrating their acts. The participants at the meeting also demonstrated -- showed their indignation. They said that certain persons wanted to destabilise the security situation in our secteur. So I took the criminals away and locked them up in the communal jail. I transferred the case file to the deputy prosecutor who was there. So this is the situation which prevailed in the course of that day, that is the 11th. So, in fact, I was saddened by the acts of these criminals who wanted to destabilise the security situation in Rusumo commune.</p>

            <p>In the night of the 11th to the 12th, another incident occurred that cost lives in Gatore secteur. Bandits attacked the house of someone by the name of Nkurinzinza and killed four people there, on the 12th. I was informed of the deaths, the death of the people killed in that secteur, and I hastened there to check out the situation. There were a lot of the people at Nkurinzinza's residence and I asked what had happened. They informed me people had come during the night and had hacked up Nkurinzinza's family with machetes. But the assailants were not arrested until the next morning. The secteur conseiller was there. He had been summoned. I immediately asked the conseiller and the responsable of the cellule to ask the local inhabitants to participate in a security meeting at Ngatore secteur office. The meeting was held. And we tried to find those bandits. After a few hours, we were able to determine the identity of the assailants, and it was a group led by someone called Augustine Nguzuzami <stage>(phonetic),</stage> alias Marishal <stage>(phonetic).</stage> We sought the group, arrested them and they were taken to the meeting and shown to the population. They told us before going to kill Nkurinzinza's they had attacked the residence of one Evariste Kamanzi, and that they had stolen property, as well as in other residences in Ngatore secteur. Having noted that there was also the problem of thieving, I summoned the judicial police of the commune to try and find where those stolen property had been hidden. I sent a vehicle to get him and I asked him to search the places where the goods stolen in a trading centre had been hidden. And we did indeed find the property, including Evariste Kamanzi's motorcycle. We inventoried the stolen property and we placed it in a room at the Ngatore secteur offices, and I said that the property must be returned to their owners who would come to claim it. So, I arrested the people who had committed those crimes and I handed them over to the prosecutor's office. All the evil doers, whether Nyamugali, Ngatore that I arrested, I made the report that I submitted to my hierarchical superior, notably the sous préfet of Kirehe for him to know, be aware of problems of insecurity in my commune. So those people were put in the communal jail. In the afternoon I stayed in Ngatore secteur, which is a big secteur. I stayed there to investigate the security situation and I went home at -- in the evening after my check. That's it.</p>

The witness testified before you regarding the date of the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, and at least on four occasions, I asked him up to that point whether there were disturbances in his commune, and he has answered, "no". I have found a document in which someone says -- someone has made it public. Someone made a publication in September 1994. I asked him if he knows the person, and he says, he was a reverend father at the Catholic mission in Rusumo. And the person says that up to the 10th, Sunday, 10th April, there were no disturbances in Rusumo. That is all I am saying; I have not said something else. And I am asking the registrar to present to the members of the Court what I am saying. I have just found an article which corroborates what the witness just said. It is not me. I have not given any evidence. I just find that there is a document which corroborates what the witness has just testified. I do not know what the Prosecutor is objecting to. </p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Honours - Madam President, this exhibit was disclosed to the Prosecutor, and it was filed on the 15th of September 2003. It was in the list of documents we filed, and it had an exhibit No. 72010. According to the registry reference given to us, this document is not from us; it was disclosed to us -- it was disclosed to the Prosecutor and to the Chamber as well. It is not today. And on 15th of September 2003, we disclosed it. It is not something new and the Prosecutor had it within the prescribed time limit, and all parties as well as the Chamber, received disclosure of this document -- of this exhibit.</p>

The documents that were disclosed to me, the authors will not come here. It has to do with Rule 89. The Accused comes here to testify to certain things which we discovered -- and we discover it was mentioned by somebody who was not concerned with the trial in 1994. </p>

            <p>Yes. The question that the Prosecutor should have asked was to -- it should have been to the effect that the journal -- the newspaper does not exist, it is not credible. This is what the problem is, Madam President. The authors of most of the documents we have been dealing with have not been coming here. We are dealing with a rule regarding all elements of evidence. If the Chamber finds that these documents can shed light on what we are saying, they should be brought -- they should be tendered here. I don't believe all the authors of most of the articles, particularly articles in newspapers have come here. You will remember that on the 29th of July, the Prosecutor disclosed a copy of a Kangura newspaper, and at the time, the newspaper was not a credible newspaper before this Chamber. And I disclosed this in September and the Prosecutor did not object to the tendering of that exhibit. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Counsel. In Rusumo commune, the situation was deteriorating increasingly, and the people arrested were not pleased about having been arrested. Criminals like them were not happy with the decision I had taken. So they wanted to come and release those people. At the time when the prosecutor's office was preparing a file on them, they came and insulted the bourgmestre, the sous préfet and the authorities, saying that they were accomplices of the RPF, and that they were being paid by the RPF, and that they had imprisoned a large number of Hutus, and in so doing, they created confusion. People from Barera in the north of the country in Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures were the root cause of the insecurity in Rusumo commune. They came in large numbers from rural areas, saying that the authorities were accomplices, and that they were acting like those who had attacked the country, and they had come to release their relatives who had been imprisoned. I was still in Gatore to check out the security situation. They came insulting the bourgmestre, but they did not find me on the spot. There was a wise man who said -- who told the sous préfet, "I have not seen the bourgmestre. There is a group of assailants who came threatening to destroy the communal office, and that if need be, they were going to kill the authorities, inform the sous préfet". And he went through and left. The assailants came to free their men. The sous préfet was afraid because he himself was not held in high esteem by those people. He was also persecuted like Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi. The people in the prosecutor's office were afraid and they were saying that the commune was going to be destroyed. Furthermore, Kibungo was not welcoming prisoners. They took the decision to release those bandits and, they were indeed released and they left. Subsequently, I saw the sous préfet and I asked him: "Why did you release those people?" And he told me, "Do you know that the situation became increasingly difficult to control? One thing is true, once the situation will have been restored, when the situation returns to normal, we will arrest them." So they did not remain in jail. </p>

            <p>No, I moved about. As you would imagine, the secteur is very vast. If you look at the map of Rusumo commune, you will find that this secteur goes as far as the border with Burundi. Between Birenga and that secteur there is a large valley in which people from Gitarama, Kibuye and Gisenyi live. They live in a region called Rotunde. We intended to make it a commune, but it didn't work. But that was what we had intended to do. So I went to that region which is on the banks of the Akagera to try to assess the security situation. So I used to move about in that region. </p>

          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>The 13th was a Wednesday. Still within the Akagera valley, very close to the farming communities near the Nyankuraje cellule, bandits attacked the house of a certain Kirushya Mabugo. His house was burnt down and two people died in the house. They were burnt, including his wife. I heard about it and I hastened to the cellule to take stock of the situation. When we got there, we arrested people. There were lots of thugs hanging around who came to the house in which the people had been burnt, and the family had told me, he was lucky to flee. And when we tried to conduct the investigations, we obtained no relevant information, but we referred the matter to the Prosecutor's office, and it carried out an investigation and managed to arrest those responsible. I left that area to go back to the communal office, and I arrived in the office at about 1 p.m. When I got to Nyakarambi in the commercial centre close to the communal office, I encountered once more a very tense situation, people who had left peasant farms and who had come accusing us of being accomplices of the RPF. They were also people from Kibungo sent by a certain Cyasa, a very, very wicked extremist, who had a group of Interahamwes working or operating under his authority, and he had heard that Gacumbitsi was imprisoning Hutus; that Gacumbitsi was sheltering in his commercial building Tutsis. I had a building which was leased to traders, and Tutsis and Hutus were renting that building. Those people who were against me and were attacking me, were saying that, "He is supporting Tutsis and he is even sheltering them in that building". And that is why that group was looking for me. When I heard about that, I asked where they were coming from. I carried out my own investigations, and I was told that those people hailed from Kibungo, that they were emissaries of Cyasa. They asked me to act immediately, otherwise my house was going to be destroyed. At the same time, there were refugees coming from Byumba, fleeing the fighting. They had come right to Kibungo. The RPF was pursuing them in order to kill them. And on the 11th and on the 12th, they arrived in Rusumo commune. I am referring to those refugees. Those refugees were also in Nyakarambi, and people were saying: "Gacumbitsi, you are the bourgmestre of Rusumo. Be careful, you know rumours can lead to very serious situations, we are from Byumba. We have come from afar. We have lost relatives; we have abandoned our properties. When we put you on guard against these kinds of misfortunes, you should be careful. You shouldn't take things lightly. We know you are the bourgmestre." So I wondered, and I asked myself, "What should I do? These people want to destroy my commune. What should I do to prevent them from doing so?" So I went to see the people who were renting my house, and I presented the situation to them, and I told them I was between the hammer and the anvil. I was caught between the hammer and the anvil, and I told them that the Cyasa emissaries wanted to destroy my house under the pretext that I was sheltering Tutsis. And I recall that the CND was the building housing the national assembly. The CND means National Development Council, which was the national assembly at the time. And they were comparing my house to the CND. Why? Because the CND at the time was sheltering a battalion of the RPF. My house was compared to the CND building that was sheltering or housing an RPF battalion. So I told them, "Gentlemen, I wouldn't like you to get killed. Pack your things and flee. When they come, they will not find you. I myself, I will go and hide in order that they shouldn't find me." Among the people I was speaking to, there were some people who had sought refuge in that building, hoping to go back to their homes when peace would return. So there were Tutsis from Rukira, from Birenga, who had come to seek shelter in that building pending when the security would become normal, and they understood when I spoke to them and they left. They went to Tanzania. Only one of them, a woman, for that matter, who had a junior sister who had a trading shop near the Nyakarambi centre, that woman did not leave; she went to live with her junior sister who was renting a house belonging to Kananura, Jonathan. All the others fled. They later on returned, of course, and they went back to Rwanda. I am sorry. I will continue explaining what happened on that day. At that time, my driver Ndabikunze did not work. He did not work on that day. He came to tell me that the situation had become critical. He asked me, "What do I do, boss, because I am also a Tutsi? And I told him, "Listen my friend, I am in the same situation as you are. Everyone for himself, try to save your skin and I am trying to -- I am going to do the same thing. If you can go to Tanzania, do so, and I will also do what I can because I am in hot water. I am accused of being a Tutsi who wants to exterminate the Hutus. They want to destroy my house. They are looking for me. I am being given all sorts of labels. So I cannot do anything for you. Do what you can to save your skin." Mr. Ndabikunze on that same day, in the night of that Wednesday, he crossed the border to go to Tanzania. And I went to see the sous préfet. I asked him: "Mr. Sous préfet, it is you who is my immediate superior, how can you protect me, I risk being killed?" I told him there was someone who died, he was a colleague of the bourgmestre of the commune of Kinigi in the Ruhengeri préfecture. He was killed in the same manner. He arrested people, he was eliminated. He died, and I thought my own time, my own day will come. So I told my sous préfet, "Listen I am not ready to sacrifice myself, I am going to run away". And the sous préfet told me, "Well, we are going to see. We are going to see how we can restore order. I am going to talk about this to the préfet. That's it". I also started hiding myself gradually. I am still talking about the events of Wednesday, Wednesday the 13th. I was afraid. I kept a low profile. Lawless people could wring your neck and they kill you and you will be buried. I was concerned about all this. </p>

            <p>Can I reply? Madam President, with all the respect I owe you, the Prosecutor has said that the witness has already answered the question; that I have drawn conclusions. I believe what is prohibited is to ask the same question to the witness, but the witness cannot answer a question that is not asked. I'm sorry, Prosecutor, you can say that I've already asked the question, but the witness cannot answer a question which I've not asked. I do not know where he will get the question from, for it to be said that he has answered. In any case, I'm trying to enlighten the Trial Chamber. If the Prosecutor finds this question disturbing, I could ignore it, but I do not think I had asked this question before. The question I asked before was the following: "Do you know Radio Muhabura in Rwanda?" That was the question I asked, Mr. Prosecutor; that's all.</p>

You have indicated a certain -- I'm going to continue, but as I've always said, the terminology or the words used before your Court should be decent words. When it is said that a member of the Defence team, or the person asking questions, has caused a lot of damage, I think this is not worthy of this Court. This is what the Prosecutor said. That is indeed what we heard in French.</p>

            <p>In 1992 -- in 1992, in fact, there were young people who would disappear like that, and it was said that they had gone, that a certain gentleman would receive them. That person lived in Gahaza in Tanzania. He's the person who led them up to Uganda. Of course, we were aware of that situation; we knew that young people were leaving. Others went by Gicuma, coming from other communes. They would cross the border at Rusumo on the market day. They would cross, and then they would cross the border. Others passed by Nasho, near the villages I talked about, and in the evening they would come and cross the border, passing by Karagwe, Karara, and they would continue on their way. We were informed of that situation. Of course, there were young people who came from Rusumo or from other préfectures or communes, young people who left, who went. During the war -- during the war, it was possible to give to travellers laissez-passers that would enable them to go to other communes or préfectures. Some persons came to see us, and we would give them travel documents to enable them to travel. People came to see us, people who regularly paid their taxes, people who had an I.D. card. There was therefore no reason to deny them travel documents. Of course, we did so, and when those persons left, I had no right to ask them where they were going, and some of those persons crossed over to Tanzania. There were several such cases who went like that. It is not surprising we were aware of that situation, yes.</p>

            <p>No, I could not run away in that manner. I could not flee in that manner. I was waiting for the sous-préfet, the préfet, to do something to ensure the security of the authorities. If I had run away with my family, that would have been very serious. I would have confirmed what people were saying. People would have said, "Well, you see, all that we were saying is true. He has taken his family away and taken refuge elsewhere." As a leader, I had some responsibilities; therefore, I could not commit such an act. It was necessary for us to stay on the spot, for people to know that my family was present. If we had run away, the situation would have been more serious throughout the commune.</p>

            <p>Witness, last Friday, we were on the date of the 14th. On that occasion, you said you asked your tenants to take appropriate steps to protect themselves, and that in that -- to that end, many of them left, but that a certain Marie went to her younger sister, called Beatrice; is that correct?</p>

            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that's correct. Beatrice was not the elder sister to Marie, she was, rather, the younger sister to Marie. She had a building where she did her small business, and her elder sister met her at Nyakarambi.</p>

            <p>On that day I went to tell them that I was in a difficult situation, that I was wanted for sheltering or giving shelter to the Tutsi and that other Tutsi had taken shelter in my house from Rukira and Birenga. After having explained to them the situation, they effectively left. They fled towards Tanzania. A certain Maria did not go together with other persons. She decided to join her younger sister, Beatrice, in the house which she was renting and where she did her trading. That house belonged to a certain Jonathan Kananura, who was the manager of the Rusumo People's Bank, the Banque Populaire du Rusumo She met her sister in that house or she joined her sister in that house and, at night, criminals came and killed the two women. </p>

            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>I had told the sous-préfet of Kirehe that the situation was bad and that I was wanted by people who wanted to kill me, in particular, people who said that -- people who said that their brothers were concerned. So I told the sous-préfet that I could be killed at any time and that he and the préfet should do everything to ensure the security of the authorities. After saying that, I went into hiding in my house. So, on Friday, I was still in the place where I was hiding. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>And on the 16th, were you still hiding?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I was still hiding because of fright. As you know, any human being in such a situation would be afraid. But subsequently, on Saturday, the 16th, I received bad news from Nyarubuye. People had taken refuge in Nyarubuye from various localities of the Kibungo préfecture: in the Rukira commune, Kigarama commune, Birenga, Kabarondo commune, and from elsewhere. These persons took refuge in Nyarubuye. Indeed, I knew that people had taken refuge there, but I thought that the number of such persons was small. Criminals launched an attack at Nyarubuye and killed them. Very early in the morning, a certain Neza came to give me news of the situation and told me that the persons who had taken refuge at Nyarubuye had been attacked by people who were on vehicles -- who came in vehicles, and that among the assailants there were soldiers, that the assailants killed the refugees and left. The refugees were killed in the afternoon and the attackers left after their crime. They came from the Rukira commune. They were led by gendarmes from Mulundi in Rukira commune. The gendarmes requisitioned people whom they took to the Nyarubuye parish, and they killed refugees. Neza informed me of these acts. He came from Birembo. Birembo is located between Rukira and Rusumo, at the crossroad of -- at the junction of the road going to Rusumo and another road going to Nasho and Panga. After having been informed of that situation, I was greatly saddened. For about two minutes, I could not speak. I was in hiding; there was nothing I could do. So I told the emissary to go and report the acts to the sous-préfet. I asked him to tell the sous-préfet to come and see me because the sous-préfet had a vehicle, but I did not have a vehicle. So Mr. Neza went to report these acts to the sous-préfet. He told the sous-préfet that the situation was very bad at Nyarubuye. The sous-préfet came to fetch me from my house. We went to his house to see what we could do in the face of this situation which had cost the lives of people at the Nyarubuye church. We asked ourselves what we could do, because we were very sad. So I told the sous-préfet that, to me, the situation was very critical because I told him, as you know, that I was painted as an accomplice of the Inkotanyi. I told him that whenever I am seen or wherever I go, people are looking for me. I also told him that he, too, was being considered as an accomplice of the Inkotanyi. I immediately asked the sous-préfet to send, on the spot, the police brigadier, who was playing the role of officier du police judiciare, to see what he could do. We didn't have enough fuel. Thus, we went to see a trader called Azarias, so that that trader could give us a vehicle, a vehicle to transport the policemen. We had to pay for the fuel he would give us later on.</p>

            <p>They returned in the evening. The brigadier gave me the report and told me that the people indeed had been killed at the parish. I asked him what the situation was. I asked him if there were many victims, because I knew that there were very few people at the parish. And he replied to me, saying that it was not a great number of people. He estimated the number of people in the church and the premises of the church at about 800 -- or, rather, between 800 and 1,000 people. That was his estimate.</p>

            <p>In spite of the people who had been killed in Rusumo commune in general, it was noticed that there was security as compared to other areas. Moreover, the people who had come to seek refuge at Nyarubuye were running away from insecurity. There were people who had come from Byumba, Kibungo, people who were running away from the Inkotanyis who were killing people. Moreover, the préfet of Kibungo had also taken refuge at Rusumo. On his arrival, he wanted to know where I was. He was told that Gacumbitsi was afraid because the persons whom he had arrested and detained, the members of their families threatened to kill him and accused him of being an accomplice of the Inkotanyi, so he sent to me policemen from various communes. They came to fetch me from my house so that I go and talk with the préfet. Apart from the préfet who took refuge in Rusumo, there were other bourgmestres, so I went to see the préfet. And, in fact, he gave me comfort. He told me, "Look, there are many refugees. Moreover, we also have come here to seek refuge. It is not necessary for you to continue hiding." So he gave me some comfort, the préfet of Kibungo.</p>

In American jurisprudence I would have applied for his answers to be struck off as unresponsive.

            <p>Your Honours, the Prosecution objects to counsel referring in any way to this diary and seeking to introduce it in evidence on the ground that this diary amounts to a prior consistent statement. It is a document prepared and written by the Accused, and cannot go to prove -- to the proof of anything he has said in this Chamber. I liken this document, Your Honours, to a witness statement taken by investigators, and submit that a witness cannot rely on his or her prior statement to establish the truth of his testimony under oath. The adverse party may, however, Your Honours, rely on such document to impeach the author of the document. In this case we submit that this amounts to a prior consistent statement, and I know of no jurisdiction where such a document is admissible. And we submit, therefore, Your Honours, that counsel should be barred from proceeding in the manner he's trying to do. Most obliged. </p>

            <p>Madam President, there is no objection. The Prosecutor has not objected to it. We wanted him to present the document to the witness. It's only when you tried to -- that he objected. He has absolutely nothing to say. This document is one of the documents on the list of documents disclosed to me in 2003 and it is a document which I disclosed to the registry. The witness has testified on the events he engaged in, in April 1994. And I did request that the Prosecutor should hand over the original of this diary. I would like to be respectful and assume that the French interpreter is not translating properly. He tried to invoke American jurisprudence. What is it all about? I say no, Prosecutor, I believe we shouldn't exaggerate this jurisdiction. Your manner of proceeding, Prosecutor, only leads to loss of time. This document has notes written by the Prosecutor, and the Prosecutor disclosed it to us, and when we want to tender it, you say it is not in line with jurisprudence of this Chamber. If this were the case, why did you disclose it? Madam President, we are relying on Article 89 in tendering this document -- Rule 89 <stage>(C)</stage> of the Rules and we are relying on this jurisprudence, and only the Chamber can tell us whether we are acting properly or not. Now, this is very serious, Madam President, and many people deplore this. The allegations mentioned in this diary referred to in 1994, Mr. Gacumbitsi is trying to re-state those events, and the Prosecutor is referring to statements taken by investigators, when were those statements taken. Now the Chamber can consider that the Accused is a victim of the -- of false accusations made by the Prosecutor. The Prosecutor knows full well that that's the situation. That the Prosecutor should rise to his feet and say that this document which was seized from Gacumbitsi at the time when he was arrested, and this is the case, and he's saying that this is a witness statement -- this is not the case. We respectfully request the Chamber to admit this document as a Defence exhibit. And, Madam President, let us bear in mind the time which we have spent on this. We are trying to meet the deadline given to us by the Chamber, the 50 minutes you gave us. </p>

            <p>Madam President, I believe this document is one of the rare documents that not only Chamber III but justice, in general, can find. We have the usual diary which is printed and we use to jot down various events. In 1994, when the Accused wrote things on this agenda, on this diary, there wasn't any war, there were no conflicts. When Gacumbitsi was arrested, he was teaching in a class. Somebody called him to the door, "I want to talk to you." From the door he was taken to the police station, and from there found himself in Arusha. And it was subsequently that his house was searched and the usual seizures were made, as they usually do when they want to recover evidence after a crime. Madam President, three years following his arrest, ten years later in relation to the date on which the agenda -- the diary was bought, what is he being accused of, Madam President? Did he know that he would be brought before this Chamber? Did he know that the president was going to be assassinated on the 6th of April 1994? Gacumbitsi knew nothing about that. I want to tender this document, and if the Prosecutor is acting in good faith, he would have -- he wouldn't have tried to tender it behind his back. He doesn't say that it's something he's told -- we should ask the question: Why is he saying all this? And it is precisely because Gacumbitsi was arrested and evidence was sought subsequently. And what is in the indictment doesn't tie in with what is in the diary. Why keep the diary of somebody else? It has no juridical value. This is the evidence, Madam President. I believe this document should be admitted without any further requirements. It is one of the most neutral documents and which sheds light on the truth because what the Accused is referring to occurred nine years ago. He jotted down this nine years ago, and he never imagined at the time that there would be a criminal tribunal. Nobody imagined when he was writing this diary that there would be disturbances in Rwanda, and that is why I want to tender this document, because it is a proper document which should be properly admitted, and the Chamber should admit it without any further requirements. I pray the Chamber most respectfully to admit -- to grant my request, which is well founded. </p>

We want to tender this document as asked now, and that is what we have distributed to the Chamber, to the Prosecutor and to the witness. We want the Prosecutor to hand over the original to us because it belongs to the -- our client, but for now we want to tender this document as our exhibit, because this exhibit has the advantage of having been translated by the Prosecutor. It will assist the Chamber. We could have gone to look for somebody to translate it. Since it's already been translated, we would pray the Chamber to accept this translated version. </p>

            <p>Before 1994, I think in 1991, one Major Ndekezi came to Rusumo, heading a contingent, and the contingent spent some time there before withdrawing. The Rwandan armed forces came to Rusumo immediately after the RPF attack, to ensure security in the border area, the frontier area. Ndekezi was the commander of that detachment, and that is how I got to know him.</p>

            <p>Yes, until 1991. At the time of the single party, there was cohesion; there were no disturbances.

            <p>Normally, a leader should not be feared by those he -- those under his authority.

            <p>Madam President, I would like the Bench to ask the Prosecutor to review his line of questioning, for the simple reason that the person who is appearing today before you has another status. He is a witness. Perhaps since he did not question him as an Accused, the Prosecutor would like to make up for what he did not do. Unfortunately, this is not the forum. The Prosecutor had the opportunity to hear people whose names are mentioned. In fact, he didn't call them as witnesses, and at the last moment he failed to call them. It is not for Gacumbitsi to answer on behalf of those witnesses who failed to appear. In particular, a certain Berakumenyo, who apparently said certain things, things which I refrain from mentioning here before the Court. But all I'm saying is that the Bench should remind the Prosecutor that Gacumbitsi is appearing here before you as a witness. The Prosecutor had the opportunity to question him as an Accused. Now he's questioning him as a witness. This is not -- the Bench is hearing the matter now, and the Prosecutor is asking questions to the witness and not to the Accused. That's what I wanted to say, Your Honours. </p>

Secondly, I have never known Cyasa as someone with whom we shared everything. I was able to know Cyasa here in prison. I carried out investigations and I was informed that Cyasa came from the Mugesera commune and that he was a member of the MDR party, but that later on, he changed parties; he became a member of the MRND party. I was told that he had young men under his orders, in the Kibungo préfecture, but I did not know him as such. Perhaps he knew me as -- in my capacity as bourgmestre, but we never shared a drink. That is how I know him. I wouldn't say that I know Cyasa as I know other persons. I wouldn't say that I know him very well.</p>

            <p>It is human to be afraid. Besides, he was not the only bourgmestre who was killed, there were others. For instance, the bourgmestre of Kiosa commune was killed; a bourgmestre of the Gitarama commune was also killed. He was not the only bourgmestre who was killed, others were killed as well. Further more, you yourself, Prosecutor, would have been afraid. If someone threatened you with death, I don't think you would stay where you are.

            <p>Listen, you may remember dates that are not recorded in your diary. Many journalists were visiting the camp and asking questions on the events that had occurred in Rwanda, and we explained to them how the events and the war unfolded. That journalist came within that framework and he put very specific questions to me regarding the events in Nyarubuye, but I did not record the date of that interview in my diary.</p>

He was saying that there were soldiers among the attackers, and it was later that I heard that gendarmes from Mulindi, and more specifically from Rukira commune, had also taken part in that massacre.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So, let's get it straight, Witness. On the morning of Saturday the 16th of April 1994, you receive a report from Neza that the attackers included soldiers and gendarmes from Mulindi, who forced the population to go with them to commit the killings; didn't you?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>No. What he said was that amongst the attackers there were soldiers. Those were his words. He did not mix up all those groups. It was subsequently that the findings of the investigations showed that it was the gendarmes who had forcefully taken members of the population -- abducted members of the population and led them away to take part in the killings.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>But it's true, Witness, isn't it, that in your testimony this afternoon you attribute this information about the gendarmes as coming -- or you attribute it as information coming from Neza on the morning of the 16th of April 1994?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that's it. I don't know exactly what words I used, if I spoke of military or gendarmes but, in any case, they were all mixed together, military, gendarmes and local inhabitants. Neza spoke to me of militaire, but it was on the basis of the investigation that we knew that it was gendarme. You can countercheck, crosscheck what I have said but, in any case, what I meant to speak of was the military.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>So we are talking of two forces here, the military and the gendarmerie, aren't we?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>And it's your evidence, isn't it, that you received this information from Neza on the morning of 16th of April 1994?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. But in truth, it was gendarmes from Mulindi. There was no other detachment. There was no military detachment in Mulindi. What he meant to tell me was that it was gendarmes but he did not know how to distinguish them. It was not military, it was the gendarmes because they were the only one who had an encampment at Mulindi in Rukira commune.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>He said that, according to his investigations, gendarmes had taken part in the massacres. You see, that's somewhat more precise.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>

Now, we've established that your brigadier told you that gendarmes from Mulindi post participated in the attack; you have also mentioned civilians.

            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>

          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, it saddened me greatly. I was shocked. People who had come to seek refuge, knowing that Rusumo was a safe place, they were chased, hunted down and killed. It was tragic, you see; yes, yes, it was tragic.</p>

          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>In general, when we spoke of Interahamwe in Kigali and elsewhere, those Interahamwe were not set up, organised to kill. It was comparable to a political party. It would help me a lot if I had the transcript of that interview. I only saw a film of the interview. I'm not sure any longer what I said. In fact, I wrote to that man. I wrote to the director, asking them how Fergal could have made a film when he arrived in Rwanda after interviewing me and not paying due regard to the advise I gave him. I was not given a copy of the film. I was saddened to see that he mixed me up with the killers. I really couldn't be among the killers.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-karegyesa">
            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, do you recall in your interview with Fergal Keane saying at least the Interahamwe in your place, meaning Rusumo commune, would not go about killing people?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#sylvestre-gacumbitsi">
            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Listen, youth, youth, youth that prepared demonstrations, that organised rallies, were not killers. The killers are easy to distinguish. They are armed, whereas youth groups in the commune only were preparing demonstrations, political rallies, but not indulging massacres. And I understand that you confuse Rusumo youth with Kigali youth. We had youth monitors in the commune. The monitor followed the associations closely, the games, sports, all youth activities. I don't know if you are trying thereby to compare the youth of our commune to the youth of Kigali.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, I made no reference to Kigali. And if you could try and listen to the question and be brief. Do you recall, when pressed for an answer by Fergal Keane, responding, and I quote: "It's the youth who organise themselves for animation and other things like that, but not to kill"? Do you recall saying that, Witness?</p>

            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Okay, I said it as regards the incadrement of the youth. I was speaking of mixed youth; Hutu and Tutsi, and who had someone in charge. It wasn't in the context of the war that I was speaking.</p>

It was a sub-question, in brackets, let's say trying to lead me to the events at the parish, and I didn't want to speak about the event at the parish because I wasn't there.</p>

            <p>You have told this Chamber that you did not flee to Tanzania on the 28th of April 1994, yet your diary has an entry that you fled on the 28th of April 1994. Now, which of the two propositions is correct? Did you flee on the 28th of April 1994, as is indicated in your diary, or did you flee subsequent to the 28th of April 1994, as you would wish this Chamber to believe? </p>

            <p>I do not know whether it is a word "we" which causes the confusion because it is said that it is at that time that we fled towards Tanzania. The Inkotanyi had arrived in Rusumo in Gatore. So I do not know whether it is the word "we" which is confusing you. I used the word "we" to refer to all these people, all refugees, all the inhabitants of Rusumo. It is this word "we" which perhaps is confusing you, but I was not talking about myself.</p>

            <p>May it please Your Honours. Can we have an indication of how long this Chamber will be sitting? I pose this question right now because we intend to play for the record the interview between Fergal Keane, our first Prosecution witness and the Accused, recorded in Benaco camp on the 30th of May 1994, to continue this cross-examination, and it runs for just about 20 minutes, maybe 27. </p>

            <p>Madam President, the Prosecutor's suggestion is a delicate one, because if the Chamber grants that request, I believe the Prosecutor will go to the extent of even drawing conclusions in this room. That is not a normal procedure. He asks questions to the witness, when he returns he can make a comparison with his tape and then he can write to you. How can we -- why should we be held back here when the Chamber told everyone that the proceedings are coming to an end today. That being the case, in what forum will the cassette be viewed? Do you want to oppose one witness against another one, or does the Prosecutor want to confuse the witness? I don't think it is appropriate to say that a cassette will be viewed, a cassette of a witness who had been here to compare it with the testimony of another witness. I do not think this is proper. It is even unthinkable. All I am telling the Prosecutor is that, if you forgot, you can come back to the transcripts of the last hearing. The Chamber decided that the Gacumbitsi case had to come to an end on the 24th of November 2003. If this is a tactic for him to extend these proceedings, then I think it is once more inappropriate. I thank you, Your Honours. </p>

            <p>Mr. Prosecutor, I find it a little surprising that you never produced a diary as part of your case. You objected vigorously when the Defence wanted to introduce it, and yet you have spent so much time cross-examining this witness on the diary. There are many of the -- much of that cross-examination, really, are matters of comment once the diary is put into evidence. We have spent a good 40 minutes on that. If that piece of evidence was so relevant, I would have expected to see it as part of the Prosecution case. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, it wasn't relevant to the Prosecution case. But in the event that this Chamber allowed this diary in, we were obliged, initially we contested, and we were overruled. This document was admitted onto the record, and we had to bring it to the attention of the Chamber. We had to bring to the attention of the Chamber matters that are merely beyond comment or submission, the double entries and non-entries of key events. The submission arising out of that evidence is different. We shall make comment during submissions, but we had to place on record certain things arising from this document that was admitted. Indeed, as you rightly know it, it wasn't relevant to the Prosecution case. The Prosecution for that reason didn't rely on this diary for its case, and least did we expect it to be admitted onto the record. </p>

            <p>Madam President, please. I think there is a procedure for calling before your Court the same witness twice. PK has already been called. If the Prosecutor wants him to come back to explain the cassette, he can do so, but he cannot say that he will project the cassette of PK so as to confront another witness with that cassette. I do not think this is a normal procedure. I do not expect the Bench to tolerate that. But now, if he wants to call that witness again, that is his absolute right, there is another procedure to be followed, but the present procedure followed by the Prosecutor is not the one to be followed.

He is talking about double entries, but I explained that I was trying to tidy up some information, to correctly write some information. I was in a refugee camp when I did this, and I realised that this causes a problem before this Court. Here we are talking about omissions of important events, double entries. Do you really think that I was preparing to appear before a court when I was doing this, at the time when I was not even indicted, when I was not an accused? I think this is pure injustice. An attempt to dwell on this is injustice. What is mentioned is mentioned, and it is true I should not be asked why I entered this or that event once or twice. Where is the evil regarding - moreover, what I did not mention took place. </p>

It is not normal, the Chamber told me: "It is out of question, Counsel, we have to end on the 24th". Excuse me, Madam President, I am trying to be cautious, but I want to point out, Madam President, that at this point, with all the respect I have for the Chamber, we are penalised because the Chamber took a decision and said that whatever happens, we will end on the 24th, on Monday. I proposed that I would reduce my examination to two hours but I was told, we have to end on Monday the 24th. And, Madam President, if we are saying that we cannot end this hearing today, I want to say, with all respect, that it is unfair and I am not mincing my words. I have done my best to have us end on Wednesday but nobody accepted.</p>

We are going to sit tomorrow since it is not a public holiday, bearing in mind the information we have just received, because we had initially thought that it would be a public holiday, that is all. And if it is a public holiday, as you know, on Wednesday, we are beginning another trial, and that is why we thought we should do everything to end today. Unfortunately, we have just realised that the Prosecutor has not ended his cross-examination and we are obliged to sit tomorrow. This is not something we are very happy about, but we are obliged to do that. Very well. We are adjourning now and we will resume tomorrow at 2:30, hoping that it wouldn't be a public holiday. </p>

            <p>Madam President, Your Honours, if the order agreed on is respected, what is said is that the Prosecutor knew that they were going to begin, and since the Trial Chamber had told us that we were allowed three days for both the Prosecutor's arguments and the Defence's arguments, that is, from the 1st to the 3rd of March, what was repeated is not later than Friday, we legitimately thought, Madam President, that we would take the day of 2nd March. Perhaps we may only need 15 minutes, but we intend to make our submissions on the 2nd. The only change now is that the Prosecution is refusing -- or, rather, it is reducing the time they would need. That is their right. We do not know whether we would take less time as they would, but all we are saying is that we are ready to make our submissions on the 2nd of March.

            <p>Madam President, the scheduling order of last week which is being referred to, and which was disclosed to us, provides that on the 1st of March, at nine o'clock, we will begin in the Laïty Kama Courtroom and in the afternoon we will go to Courtroom III and we will continue thus. Madam President, the country from which I come or the legal system from which I come, the Prosecutor at the time of their submissions may say that they would listen to the Bench, in other words, after having submitted or filed their submissions, they would say, well, they have nothing else to say. If the Prosecutor refuses to make oral submissions, they cannot apply same to the Defence. In any case, the Prosecutor fulfilled their task on 26th -- 20th June. Gacumbitsi is in prison. The Prosecutor may decide not to say anything. I, the Defence, I have things to say. I have matters to bring before you, and the Prosecutor cannot impose on me their view of things. I am here to defend; he is here to prosecute. He says he will take one hour, and I am saying that I will take from nine to5 p.m. tomorrow. That is our position, and nobody can impose their position on the other party, especially as it is true that our interests are antagonistic. And I do not think that at any point in time we were asked by your Trial Chamber to say how much time we will take or when we will make our submissions. In any case, the Prosecutor should know that the case law before your Trial Chamber up to the Gacumbitsi case is such that after Prosecutor's closing arguments, the Defence is given time. I do not want to make reference to any specific case, but in some cases -- in fact, that interruption was 48 hours; that is, after the Prosecutor's closing arguments, the Defence counsel started making their submissions only the following day, and in other cases, sometimes interruptions last about two days. We, in our specific case, respectfully, we are saying that we are ready to make our oral submissions tomorrow, the 2nd of March 2004, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. That is our position and that position is in conformity with the law. We are not trying to depart in any manner whatsoever from your scheduling order.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Counsel Kouengoua. The Chamber is of the opinion that both parties have filed a written brief, approximately 100 pages of written briefs, and it would be of no purpose for parties to engage in a repetition of what appears in those briefs. Rather, parties should barely make observations in regard to those positions that had been stated earlier on in the briefs. We are not attempting to determine or to make or take a stand in regard to your conduct. We intend to allow each party to make its submissions or closing arguments. We also intend to give you the opportunity to respond. However, we think we should not wait until tomorrow. It would be of no purpose if the Prosecutor were to conclude her closing arguments this morning. I believe you could start off this afternoon, Mr. Kouengoua. I believe you are ready. That has already been scheduled some time back. We are, therefore, going to ask the Prosecutor to start off with her closing arguments, and this afternoon you will start, Mr. Kouengoua, and in the event the Accused would want to say a few words to the Court, we will be willing to listen to him, a few minutes, no more than five to ten minutes. Mr. Kouengoua, our hope is that your submissions will not exceed two hours. That is our decision in regard to this matter, and without further waste of time, we will allow the Prosecutor to address the Court. The Prosecutor has the floor. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>I am most obliged, Your Honours. Genocide, Your Honours is the ultimate crime, the crime of crimes, involving the deliberate and wanton slaughter of the people on account of their blood and birth, the ultimate nightmare of humanity that brings us here today. Genocide, Your Honours, is what we allege and have proved occurred in Rwanda during 100 days of murder and mayhem in April through July 1994, a very sad closing chapter, Your Honours, to the last century, written in the blood of its victims. In my opening address on the 28th of July 2003, I set out what we sought to prove, that the defendant Silvestre Gacumbitsi, in concert with others, embarked on a deliberate course of action within days of the death of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994, a criminal course of action whose singular objective was the total destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group, a diabolic plot that resulted in the killing, maiming and rape of thousands of Tutsi civilians in the Rusumo commune during the month of April 1994, crimes for which we now seek his conviction. Gacumbitsi, Your Honours, stands charged with five counts: the count of genocide or complicity in genocide in the alternative, and the counts of extermination, murder and rape, as crimes against humanity, all arising from the culpable acts we alleged and proved he committed in concert with others as part of a common criminal campaign in Rusumo commune in April 1994. We have filed a detailed brief, Your Honours, setting out our analysis of the law and the facts, and our duty today is to sum up our case and respond to any questions you may wish to raise. The core issues for determination by Your Honours have been narrowed by Defence admissions during the course of the trial. With exception to the count of rape, the following matters are not disputed: one, that there was a massacre of Tutsi civilians at Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April 1994; two, that Marie, Beatrice, Mutunzi, Rukomeza and Kanyogote were killed as alleged in the indictment. On these two points, Your Honours, what is in issue is whether the alleged killings were committed by the Accused, with the requisite intent under the various crimes charged, and whether he is criminally responsible. With regard to the count of rape, the Defence contests that the rapes were committed as alleged. And so, all the issues with regard to rape are outstanding. It is the case for the Prosecution, Your Honours, that on the 15th of April 1994, at around 2:30 p.m., the Accused Silvestre Gacumbitsi and others not before this Court arrived at Nyarubuye parish, where thousands of Tutsi civilians as well as some few Hutus had taken sanctuary, fleeing attacks in their homes and villages following the death of President Habyarimana. The Accused in the company of communal policemen and armed militiamen paved the way for a massive slaughter by first announcing that, and I quote: "The hour of the Tutsi had come." He immediately lent meaning to his statement, Your Honours, by hacking to death an aged Tutsi male named Murefu with a machete and ordering his policemen to shoot at the crowd of refugees. With those actions, Your Honours, commenced a barbaric attack lasting anywhere between three to four hours, in which countless Tutsi civilians were killed on account of their ethnicity. Guns and grenades were used against these civilian refugees while militiamen hacked the wounded to death and looted their victims' property. That wasn't the end of it, Your Honours. Gacumbitsi returned to this horrific scene on the next day, the 16th of April 1994, and returned once again on the 17th of April 1994, on both occasions with commune policemen and armed militiamen, to finish off any survivors from the carnage of the night before, in order that none would live to tell the tale of his horrific deeds. In a nutshell, Your Honours, that was the Prosecution case proved at this trial for the counts of genocide and extermination. We submit that the evidence proffered at trial has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that from the 15th through the 17th of April 1994, the Accused, in concert with others not before this Court, with intent to destroy an ethnic group in whole or in part, participated in and presided over the large-scale killing of thousands of Tutsi civilians sheltered at Nyarubuye parish. The evidence also proves beyond reasonable doubt, Your Honours, that the massacre of Tutsi civilians at Nyarubuye parish was not an isolated or fortuitous incident, but part of a widespread or systematic attack on the Tutsi civilian population, on account of their ethnicity. This, Your Honours, was the evidence of Prosecution witnesses TAQ, TAO and TAX, who from their various positions at Nyarubuye parish saw the Accused arrive with armed assailants and launched a ferocious attack in broad daylight. These witnesses, Your Honours, knew Gacumbitsi prior to the massacres and would have had no difficulty in singling him out of a crowd in broad daylight. He arrived in common style, in a communal pickup, accompanied by a quadrille of communal policemen and armed militiamen. These same witnesses, Your Honours, had further opportunity to positively identify the Accused when he returned to Nyarubuye parish on the 16th and the 17th of April 1994. Now, the picture I have just painted, Your Honours, would be incomplete without reference to the context in which this macabre slaughter was committed or without reference to the sequence of events between the 7th and the 15th of April 1994, in Rusumo commune. Regarding the context, Your Honours, you heard the expert testimony of Dr. Alison Des Forges, and you have read the manuscript of her testimony in the case of The Prosecutor against Akayesu, which was admitted onto the record in this case as Prosecution Exhibit No. 15. Her unchallenged and uncontroverted opinion is that the massacre of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 were not spontaneous but centrally organised and supervised, with the sole intention of complete destruction of the Tutsi as an ethnic group. And we would submit on this score, Your Honours, that the Nyarubuye carnage was no exception and neatly fits into the nationwide campaign that was going on simultaneously all over Rwanda. Equally relevant for Your Honours' deliberation is the sequence of events and actions of the Accused which point to the planning and premeditation behind the Nyarubuye massacre. They are sufficiently addressed in our written brief, and we only single out the most salient from which the necessary inferences of guilt must flow. According to the evidence of Witness TAW, Your Honours, the Accused attended a meeting in Kibungo on the 8th of April 1994, at which TAW subsequently learnt that the plot to exterminate the Tutsi had been elaborated. It does not injure our case, Your Honours, to concede that this is hearsay evidence with little probative value if seen out of the circumstances that subsequently unfolded in Rusumo in the following week. It was also the case for the Prosecution, Your Honours, that on Saturday, 9th of April 1994, Gacumbitsi, as bourgmestre of Rusumo, convened and presided over a meeting of conseillers and political party heads at the communal conference hall. It was at this meeting, Your Honours, according to the evidence of Witness TBH, that Gacumbitsi instigated his conseillers to organise the killing of Tutsis in their respective secteurs. The evidence of TBH, Your Honours, is in part corroborated by Witness TAW, and it is vital evidence proving the nascent stages of the extermination plan and the premeditation with which the killings were committed. On the evening of 9th of April 1994, TAW was briefed by TBH about what had transpired at the said meeting earlier on; namely, that the Accused Silvestre Gacumbitsi had elaborated the plan to kill Tutsis and had asked his conseillers to put it into immediate effect. We concede, Your Honours, that there is some divergence between what TBH purported to have told TAW and what TAW says he was told by TBH. The common denominator, however, Your Honours, remains constant, that the Tutsi's moment of reckoning had finally come. It is tempting, Your Honours, for the Defence to rely on the seemingly inaccuracy and minor inconsistency and blow it out of proportion in their brief. We explain it, however, by the passage of time, the influence of that call on that occasion and the failure of human memory. Posed against the background of what actually happened, however, over the next course -- over the course of the next seven days, this meeting neatly conforms with the general scheme to exterminate the Tutsis, and we would, in the circumstances of the whole case, urgeYour Honours to treat it likewise. It was the further evidence, Your Honours, of Witness TAW, that on the 10th of April 1994, the Accused Silvestre Gacumbitsi went to the Rwandan army camp in Kibungo with three communal pickup trucks and took delivery of 105 cartons of assorted weapons. According to TAW, Your Honours, these cartons were distributed the same day in Rusumo commune by the Accused and communal policemen to all the various secteurs. We again, concede, Your Honours, that the only evidence that these cartons contained weapons is based on the assumption of Witness TAW and on the contemporaneous report he received from one Leonidas Gacondo, the responsable of Kabuza cellule, who had taken delivery of several of those cartons from Gacumbitsi that same afternoon. Gacondo, Your Honours, purportedly told Witness TAW that the cartons did indeed contain weapons. The events, Your Honours, transpiring in Rusumo over the next week lend credence to the evidence of TAW in this regard and render it reliable and beyond reproach. The Prosecution, Your Honours, also led evidence of four representative instances where the Accused publicly ordered and/or instigated civilians to isolate and kill their Tutsi neighbours. It was evidence of TAS corroborated by that of TAW, that on the 13th of April 1994, the Accused addressed the people gathered at Nyakarambi market and told them in his speech to ensure, and I quote, "their own security", by reference to the houses which could be seen burning in the neighbouring commune of Rukira. Both TAS, a Hutu, and TAW, a Tutsi, understood the Accused's utterances to be an encrypted call upon the Hutu to kill the Tutsi. These witnesses are, of course, entitled to their own interpretation, which cannot be held against the Accused if seen in isolation of the prevailing circumstances of the day. TAW, Your Honours, was privy to classified information about the plan to kill the Tutsi. He fled to safety in Tanzania shortly after the speech by Gacumbitsi. On the other hand, Witness TAS overheard a communal policeman called Kazoba, saying that the Accused had given orders that all Tutsis should be killed by noon of 14th of April 1994, starting with the killing of Marie and Beatrice, Gacumbitsi's Tutsi tenants. We have, Your Honours, attempted to sequentially trace the path of the genocide from the 8th to the 13th of April, like a cyclone picking debris in its wake. We now move to the 14th of April 1994. But maybe before we do, the events I have just addressed Your Honours, if considered independent of each other, they may appear to be worthless as evidence. We submit, however, Your Honours, that they are very relevant and of probative value because they are the various pieces of this jigsaw puzzle that neatly fit into each other and ought to be seen as a whole. During your deliberations, Your Honours, we'd urge you to look at the evidence as a whole, not in a compartimentalised and narrow way, because it is only then that it makes meaning. What happened on the 14th of April, Your Honours, the day before the slaughter at Nyarubuye the next day, we have the evidence of Witness TBH, TBI, TBJ and TBK, all ex-detainees in Rwanda who we referred to in our written brief as accomplices, accomplices because the offences with which they were charged in Rwanda were committed at the bidding of the Accused, form part of the same genocide we alleged and proved. It was the evidence of Witness TBH and TBJ that in the morning of the 14th of April 1994, the Accused in the company of his policemen arrived at Rwanteru trading centre and exhorted the crowd to kill Tutsi and loot their property. They were quick to comply, Your Honours. According to Witness TBK, later that day, at around 3 p.m., the Accused in the company of policemen arrived at Kanyinya trading centre with the same message, that of killing the Tutsi. According to TBK, Your Honours, the killing of Tutsi commenced the next day in his neighbourhood, all done at the instigation of Silvestre Gacumbitsi. An hour later, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi with his policemen in tow turned up at Gisenyi trading centre at approximately 4 p.m. that afternoon, again, with the same message, instigating the killing of Tutsi and the plunder and pillage of their property. According to TBI, who confessed to have killed a woman, her children and a man, whom he threw into the Kagera river, the killings in Gisenyi also commenced the next day, on the 15th of April 1994. For reasons that are not entirely clear to the Prosecution, Your Honours, the Defence in its written brief suggests that these witnesses are not accomplices. I would be remiss in my duty as an officer of this Court to treat these witnesses as anything other than accomplices. They are accomplices par excellence, and that is why in our written brief we advise caution when Your Honours are considering their evidence. It needs no restatement that in most jurisdictions accomplice evidence is treated with the utmost caution. We note, however, Your Honours, that the accomplices, in the course of their testimony, individually denied any threat or inducement to come and testify, and the peculiar circumstances of each are adequately dealt with in our written brief and need no repetition here, for fear of compromising their protected identities. And it is for this same reason, Your Honours, that we shall not indulge the Defence in their gratuitous and their unsavoury comments, unsupported by any evidence, of why these witnesses chose to testify the way they did. We now move, Your Honours, to the 15th of April 1994. Prior to the major assault on Nyarubuye parish, Your Honours, the evidence of Witnesses TAC and TAK places the Accused in and between Nyabitare and Nyarubuye, contrary to the Accused's assertion that he was in hiding. It was the evidence of Witness TAC, Your Honours, that the Accused arrived at the Nyabitare Catholic centre at approximately 1 p.m. in the company of armed communal policemen, including Kazoba and Berakumenyo. The two policemen are alleged by the witness to have entered the Catholic centre building and emerged with two Tutsi males, Rukomeza and Mutunzi. They first assaulted these Tutsi males with their gun butts in the presence of Accused Gacumbitsi, who was interrogating them. From his hiding place, TAC was not able to hear the nature of the questions posed by Gacumbitsi, but did hear the two victims cry out loud for mercy, pleading to be shot rather than killed with machetes. Their prayers were promptly answered by one of the policemen, who shot them both while the Accused drove off to Nyarubuye. Shortly after this very incident, Your Honours, Witness TAK spotted the Accused in a convoy of vehicles headed towards Nyarubuye. Both Witnesses TAC and TAK subsequently heard the sound of gunfire and explosions originating from Nyarubuye direction that same afternoon. That, Your Honours, is the core of the Prosecution evidence in support of the counts of genocide and extermination. I now move to the count of rape. </p>

            <p>Most obliged, Your Honours. Your Honours will recall the second Prosecution witness, TAQ, nine months pregnant on 17th April of 1994, according to testimony. Her evidence is that at around 9 a.m. on the morning of the 17th of April 1994, the Accused drove by her hiding place and she heard him announce loud and clear over a megaphone that Tutsi females should be raped, and if there was any resistance, they should be killed in an atrocious manner. </p>

            <stage>(continuing)</stage>
            <p>Shortly after this call for rape by the Accused, a group of about ten Interahamwe discovered TAQ and seven other female colleagues and flushed them out of their hiding place. These Interahamwes, Your Honours, press-ganged the eight females up the hill and threatened them with death for non-compliance before forcefully undressing them and raping them. It was the evidence of TAQ that she was raped while nine months pregnant, and actually gave birth that same day subsequent to the rape. Her colleague, Chantal, was less fortunate. She was murdered. The assailants spread her legs and thrust a wooden stake up her vagina. She probably bled to death because of this assault. That, Your Honours, is the evidence in support of the facts pleaded in paragraph 39 of the indictment, which proves beyond any reasonable doubt that the Accused Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is guilty of rape as a crime against humanity, on account of instigating the rape of Tutsi women as part of a widespread or systematic attack on the Tutsi civilian population. Now, in addition to relying on the evidence of Dr. Alison Des Forges, which established beyond reasonable doubt in the Akayesu case that rape and other forms of sexual violence against Tutsi women was an integral part of the widespread and systematic attacks on the Tutsi population in 1994, the Prosecution also led the evidence of Witness TAS, a Hutu female married to a Tutsi. TAS was gang-raped by two Hutu men, including Muvunangoma, a younger brother of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. Muvunangoma claimed that Gacumbitsi had authorised them to rape and murder Tutsi women. She was not killed subsequent to the rape, but her Tutsi husband was less fortunate. He was killed that same evening by a mob of Tutsi <stage>(sic)</stage> assailants. Your Honours will also recall the evidence of Witness TAP, which also establishes the widespread and systematic rapes in Rusumo commune during the month of April 1994. Your Honours excluded a portion of this witness's testimony on account of prejudice to the Accused for late or non-disclosure. The rest of her testimony remains on record. According to TAP, Your Honours, after the Nyarubuye massacre, she and her mother were gang-raped by a gang of about 30 Hutu assailants, including one of her former domestic servants. After raping TAP's mother, Your Honours, the assailant thrust a wooden branch through her vagina, which exited through her head, killing her instantly. TAP, too, Your Honours, was also gang-raped, subsequent to which a metre-long branch was thrust up her vagina. You recall the evidence of Witness TAO, a male Tutsi, husband and father of children, who witnessed the gang-rape and subsequent murder of his wife by the rapists, rapists who also killed his children by tossing them into a fire. Such, Your Honours, is the depravity with which these crimes were committed. I will now move on, Your Honours, to briefly address the count of murder. Maybe before I do, Your Honours, I just wish to remind you that in the Prosecutor's brief, at Annex B, is a memorial summarising the evidence of widespread and systematic attacks on a civilian population, containing some 196 references from the record. So when you're considering, Your Honours, that common element to all crimes against humanity, for ease of reference there is Annex B. The Accused, Your Honours, is also charged with murder as a crime against humanity, the material facts of which are pleaded in paragraphs 33, 34 and 36 of the indictment, where we allege the murder of Kanyogote, Mutunzi, Rukomeza, Marie and Beatrice respectively. I would be quick to concede, Your Honours, that paragraph 33 is defective from misdescription of the victim, but we submit, Your Honours, that the defect is not total and does not in any way prejudice the Accused. The paragraph, Your Honours, pleads the killing of a Tutsi female and her three children, while the evidence adduced at trial proved the killing of a male Tutsi named Kanyogote and his two children. In either case, the victim is a Tutsi adult, friend of the Accused, who happened to be a godfather of one of the children. The Accused was on sufficient notice of the allegation based on the adequate and timely disclosure of the statement of Witness TAK and the clarification contained in paragraph 2.30 of the pre-trial brief, which specifically mentions the murder of Kanyogote. It was the evidence, Your Honours, of Witness TAK that on the evening of the 14th of April 1994, he went with Kanyogote and his two children to the Accused's residence to seek shelter from the attacks on Tutsi homes in the region. TAK, however, Your Honours, didn't enter Gacumbitsi's residence as the victims did. He remained approximately 50 yards from Gacumbitsi's house. A short while later, TAK observes a large crowd emerging out of Gacumbitsi's house while beating someone. In an instant, TAK heard Kanyogote loudly pleading for mercy and imploring Gacumbitsi to spare his life. TAK, Your Honours, never witnessed or saw who actually killed Kanyogote, but he later identified Kanyogote's remains during an exhumation near the Accused's house in 1997. The remains still had the clothes that Kanyogote wore when TAK last saw him alive. </p>

            <p>It would, in a municipal jurisdiction, probably be fatal, if a technical, narrow approach is used, but we submit in the context of mass crimes targeting civilian groups, civilian populations, on account of either ethnicity, religion, politics, the Statute seeks to protect groups and members of the groups. What is important is the subjective perception of the perpetrator when such a crime is committed. In this case, we concede that there is a defect but not so fatal as it does not cause any prejudice to the Accused as long as action was taken subsequent to the indictment to put him on sufficient notice. Now, in municipal jurisdictions, judges would ordinarily have inherent jurisdiction or power to amend an indictment to conform to the evidence led. In the event that it hasn't been done, Your Honours, you may wish to consider it as a possibility. May I proceed? </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Your Honours. In paragraph 34 of the indictment, Your Honours, the Prosecution alleges the murder of Mutunzi and Rukomeza. Again, they are not specifically named in the indictment as being Mutunzi and Rukomeza. Reference is just made to Tutsi males. This, however, is clarified in paragraph 2.28 of the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief and the Accused was on sufficient notice of the particulars of the victims by reason of the disclosure of the written statement of Witness TAC, a witness to these events. The murder of Mutunzi and Rukomeza at Nyabitare Catholic Centre has already been discussed under the count of genocide and extermination and merits no repetition. Now, with regard to paragraph 36 of the indictment, Your Honours, the Prosecutor relied on circumstantial evidence to prove that the Accused was criminally responsible for the murders of Marie and Beatrice, two Tutsi females, on the night of the 13th of April 1994 at Nyakarambi trading centre. It's not disputed by the Defence that they were murdered in cold blood, Your Honours. What they contest is who is criminally responsible for the killings. The Prosecutor relied upon evidence that proved that the Accused evicted these two tenants from his house on account of their ethnicity. Antecedent to this, of course, Your Honours, the Accused had instigated his conseillers on the 9th of April 1994 to kill Tutsis, he had distributed weapons for the purpose on the 10th of April 1994, and on the night of 13th April, Witness TAS overheard Kazoba, the notorious communal policeman, saying that the Accused had ordered the killing of Tutsis, starting with Marie and Beatrice. And in this regard, our submission is, Your Honours, that the only inference that can be drawn from these circumstances is that the Accused is criminally responsible for these double murders, which were a foreseeable, if not intended, result of the common plot, scheme or design to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group, even though committed by proxy in furtherance of the said plot. Now, in addition, Your Honours, to the murders I've just addressed you on, the Prosecution relies on other murders, namely the killing of Murefu and others at Nyarubuye on the 15th of April 1994, the killing of Mukamwiza on the 16th of April 1994, to prove that the alleged or the pleaded murders were committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, on account of their ethnicity. </p>

            <p>Most obliged, Your Honours. Now, in the face of such overwhelming evidence, Your Honours, what would the Defence have you believe? The last stand of the Accused is that he was without power, influence or knowledge of the plot, that he was in hiding, the supposed victim of marauding criminals who alleged that he was an accomplice of the Tutsi and deserving of similar fate. If, as the Defence claims, Gacumbitsi was in hiding between the 13th through the 17th of April 1994, why was no notice of alibi served on the Prosecution, you may wish to ask. Or if indeed it be true that he was hiding at his house, why were no witnesses ever called to say so? Would a victim threatened by ruthless criminals hide at his house which was by the roadside and publicly known? Wouldn't he be exposing himself to great risk? A resolution of these questions, Your Honours, is to be found in the record from Prosecution evidence and from the Accused's own testimony. It was Gacumbitsi's evidence, Your Honours, that he was in hiding at his house from the afternoon of the 13th through the 17th of April. Pressed in cross-examination by the Prosecutor, Your Honours, this is what Gacumbitsi had to say, and I quote: "Listen, to say that I was in hiding in my house, that does not mean I was indeed in my house, but I had asked members of my family not to tell anyone where I was. That's what I said. That's what I asked my family members to say." This glaring contradiction, Your Honours, remains unresolved on the record. Your Honours have no explanation from the Accused, or any other witness, for that matter, as to his actual whereabouts between the 13th through the 17th of April. The only evidence you have, Your Honours, is that from Prosecution witnesses who knew him and positively identified him at the various crime scenes alleged in the indictment on the disputed dates. Now, in an attempt to plug this gaping hole in Defence evidence, Your Honours, the Defence closing brief tries to breathe a new meaning into the concept of alibi. If you look at the Defence closing brief, at page 18 of the English version, and I believe it's paragraph 8, it reads, and I quote: "What matters in alibi is not to state the place where the Accused was but to prove that he was not present at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed." This novel proposition advanced by the Defence, Your Honours, is not supported by any authority whatsoever, and we submit that it is a deliberate misrepresentation of the law. Now, in adversarial jurisdictions, the Prosecutor bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was present and committed the crimes with which he's charged, and this burden never shifts. It does not even shift where an accused asserts an alibi. Where, however, an accused raises an affirmative defence of alibi, he must present evidence which tends to show that by reason of his presence at a particular place, at a particular time, he was not at the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the alleged time of its commission. Evidence which merely, you know, indicates that an accused was not present at the scene of a crime, with no corresponding positive assertion as to where the accused was, is not evidence in support of an alibi at all. And we submit, Your Honours, that this interpretation of the law on alibi finds support in our own Rules of Procedure and Evidence at Rule 67 <stage>(A)</stage>
              <stage>(ii)</stage>
              <stage>(a),</stage> which reads in part, and I quote -- or which requires the Defence to notify the Prosecution of, and I quote, "the place or places at which the accused claims to have been present at the time of the alleged crime and the names and addresses of witnesses and any other evidence upon which the accused intends to rely to establish the alibi." </p>

            <p>Now, let it not be misunderstood for a moment that the Prosecution seeks to shift the burden on the Accused to prove his alibi. Not at all. But there is basic evidence that is required to establish an alibi, and in this case, Your Honours, we submit that there is no evidence and, therefore, this is not an alibi at all. You don't know, we don't know, where the Accused was on the disputed dates, and other than Prosecution evidence placing him at the scenes of crime, there is no other evidence as would cast an iota of doubt on the Prosecution case. We therefore urge Your Honours to disregard this pseudo-alibi in its entirety. The alibi aside, Your Honours, we turn briefly to consider Defence evidence with regard to some of the events on which we led evidence, and as I said earlier, Your Honours, we filed a detailed written brief so we shall attempt to be short and to the point. I noted, when I started an hour ago, Your Honours, that the massacre of civilians at Nyarubuye parish is not contested. Nor is it contested that on the 16th of April 1994, there was a mopping-up exercise which involved the killing off of survivors. We submit, Your Honours, that from the sheer scale and intensity of this sustained attack, the only inference that can be readily drawn -- or the only inferences that can be readily drawn are that, one, the intention was genocidal, and, two, that the massacre was part of a broader ethnical or politically motivated, widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population as alleged in the indictment. The Defence called four witnesses, and I will briefly highlight the disturbing parts of their testimony, Your Honours. Witness NG2 for the Defence claims that the attack was led by gendarmes from Mulindi, who forced civilians like him to join the group of attackers. Surprisingly, however, Your Honours, while other civilians carried traditional weapons, and were compelled by the assailants to wear banana leaves, this witness obtained an exemption from the gendarmes. He neither carried a weapon nor did he have to don banana leaves. NG2 claims that he neither killed nor looted any property during the Nyarubuye attack on the 15th of April 1994; yet he positions himself in the front row of activity, side by side with the armed gendarmes. He claims to have spent almost two hours at the parish during the attack and says many people died during the attack, although he only concedes to seeing one corpse. It's NG2's testimony that he never saw Gacumbitsi at Nyarubuye parish during this same attack. I don't find it surprising, Your Honours; if he only saw a single corpse during a massacre that lasted more than two hours, you wouldn't expect him to have seen Gacumbitsi, would you? It's simple. A witness who denies the obvious, for whatever reason, isn't to be relied upon. He must be treated with caution, the same caution you would apply while evaluating the evidence of an accomplice, particularly where the witness seeks to exculpate himself from any criminal activity, in this case incompatible with where he was positioned during the attack. We therefore advise caution, Your Honours, and submit that the evidence of this witness is inherently unreliable. The next Defence witness, Your Honours, UHT, was also purportedly forced by men wearing banana leaves and press-ganged to Nyarubuye parish on the 16th of April 1994, a day after the massacre. His evidence is that he found soldiers, gendarmes, and people wearing kitenge uniforms killing off any survivors from the carnage of the night before. UHT claims to have spent at least six hours at the parish doing nothing but watching the murderers. His evidence, too, is that he never saw Gacumbitsi at the parish on the 16th of April 1994. This witness, Your Honours, was not an impressive witness, to say the least. He posts the death of President Habyarimana on the 10th of April 1994, a four-day margin of error, rendering his presence at Nyarubuye parish on the 16th of April highly improbable, if not mistaken. Now, apart from keenly playing victim and distancing himself from the criminal activity of that day, he was also evasive in answering questions, and his testimony is replete with inconsistencies between written statement and oral evidence. On many occasions, Your Honours, he blamed the error on the investigator who recorded his statement, and, in fact, his testimony ended like this, and I quote: "Is it the first mistake we have noticed since I began my testimony?" This witness, too, Your Honours, refused to admit the obvious. He refused to admit that the Tutsis were the targets of the killings and violence in and around Nyarubuye, despite the fact that he and his brother-in-law were, on that morning, beaten by masked men on account of unresolved questions pertaining to their ethnic identity. It's therefore not surprising, Your Honours, that another witness who would deny the obvious would equally deny the presence of Gacumbitsi at Nyarubuye on that day. You recall the evidence of Defence Witness ZHZ. He too claims he was forced to the parish by attackers. He also distances himself from any criminal activity by placing himself at the back of the crowd of attackers and conveniently manages to slip away when the explosions begin. He never saw a single corpse, but that's beside the point. His credibility is particularly more doubtful on account of false representations made on the record concerning his own criminal antecedents during cross-examination by the Prosecution. These matters are adequately addressed in the closing brief and will not be recounted here, for fear of compromising his protected identity, but I would urge Your Honours to treat his evidence with utmost circumspection and caution. The last Defence witness to testify about the Nyarubuye massacre, ZIZ, was equally preposterous. He too didn't see Gacumbitsi on that day, and also claims that he was press-ganged by assailants who were going to the parish to kill accomplices. He was labelled an accomplice by the assailants but was never killed. I find that hard to reconcile. He said he didn't know who the assailants were but was emphatic that they were from Birenga. How would he know unless he knew them? Asked by Your Lordships what he meant by "innocent" -- "innocent" in closed quotes -- in relation to those people asked to step outside from the crowd at the parish just before the attack, he was totally evasive and feigned ignorance. In short, he failed to acknowledge that it was the Hutus who were asked to separate from the crowd of the Tutsi refugees before the attack began. He also referred to "accomplices" -- in quotes -- but he couldn't explain to Your Lordships what he meant or understood "accomplices" to mean within the context of the prevailing circumstances. You will also recall the witness saying that the refugees at the parish were guilty, but didn't explain what they were guilty of. Now, it was common knowledge, Your Honours, that the refugees were guilty because they were Tutsi. That was the only crime: They were Tutsi. This witness, Your Honours, was also emphatic that he never saw communal policemen at the parish during the massacre, never mind that he couldn't tell the difference between communal policemen and gendarmes. Such, Your Honours, are the witnesses the Defence would have you believe regarding the events at Nyarubuye on those tragic dates of 15th and 16th April 1994, witnesses who will deny the most obvious and whose only common ground is that they did not see Gacumbitsi at the parish on those dates. </p>

            <p>We would submit, Your Honours, and very strongly too, that the evidence of these four witnesses was totally lacking in credit and does not cast an iota of doubt on the evidence proffered by the Prosecution, and we would urge Your Honours to disbelieve it altogether. As I wrap up, Your Honours, I will just briefly touch on Gacumbitsi's defences or evidence concerning the alleged meeting of 9th of April 1994 at the Rusumo communal office where he instigated his conseillers to commence the killings of Tutsis. The Accused concedes that the alleged meeting was held but denies that it was to instigate the killing of Tutsis. Against the backdrop of events as they unfolded subsequent to the 9th of April 1994, we submit that Gacumbitsi's blanket denial does not cast any doubt on the Prosecution evidence proffered by TAW and TBH. Similarly, Your Honours, the Accused denies going to the FAR military camp in Kibungo on the 10th of April 1994 to take delivery of weapons. His evidence is that he was in Nyamugali on the morning of the 10th of April 1994, and Witness ZEZ testified in support of this alibi. ZEZ's evidence, Your Honours, should equally be treated with circumspection. This is a witness who was evasive in answering questions concerning the death of Kanyogote, and when asked by Your Lordships why he never reported Kanyogote's death to the authorities, his evidence is that the authorities were useless at the time. Now, if indeed it be true that the authorities were useless, it's highly unlikely that the authority, Gacumbitsi, would have gone to Nyamugali on the 10th of April 1994, as he claims. You will recall that this alleged visit to Nyamugali was put to TAW in cross-examination by the Defence and he was emphatic that Gacumbitsi did not go to Nyamugali. Rather, it was the communal police in another communal vehicle who went to Nyamugali on that occasion. TAW was emphatic he was with Gacumbitsi the whole of the 10th, from morning until late evening; at no point did they go to Nyamugali. Your Honours, with regard to the counts of murder and rape, the Accused's defence is an outright denial and a -- what I call his pseudo-alibi, which we have extensively discussed and merits no further comment.

            <p>Unlike municipal jurisdictions, where there is normally only one murder count in any single charge in an indictment, this is different. It's generic and representative charging. We will not indulge the Defence in the libellous and unsavoury comment rendered on the Prosecution witnesses, and with regard to rape, the Defence offered no eye-witness, direct witness, to the rapes alleged. The Defence position was contra-existential, i.e., all the Defence witnesses proffered at trial claim not to have heard Gacumbitsi ordering or instigating rape of Tutsi women. We submit that however often a non-proposition is repeated, it remains a non-proposition. The mere fact that Defence witnesses testified that they never heard Gacumbitsi ordering rape cannot controvert the direct evidence of those who heard him order the rape and who were raped subsequent to such orders or instigation. If you permit me, Your Honours, I would like to wrap up in time for the mid-morning break. We conclude, Your Honours, by submitting that the Prosecutor has discharged the onerous burden of proving all the counts charged beyond reasonable doubt and would accordingly request that you find the Accused guilty of genocide, extermination, murder and rape. Our submission on the appropriate sentences is adequately laid out in the closing brief and merits no further discussion here, save that we request that if found guilty and convicted, Accused Sylvestre Gacumbitsi should be put away for life. I'm most obliged, Your Honours. </p>

            <p>Good afternoon, Madam President. Good afternoon, Your Honours. Good afternoon, the other members of this Court. Madam President, Your Honours, as the Prosecutor said this morning, the matter before us today is the nightmare experienced by the people of Rwanda in 1994. Madam President, from the month of April to the month of July 1994, hundreds of people died in Rwanda, which at that time, Madam President -- which at that time seemed to enjoy peace, the kind of peace that a country could enjoy, and, in particular, some economic development. Above all, the world had confidence in that small country. However, Madam President, as I said earlier on, that country, Rwanda, experienced the most hideous crime that did dishonour and which still continues to do dishonour to the world as a whole. Who was the perpetrator of those crimes? Was it the government in place at the time? Was it the RPF? Or was it because those who at the time were sent on the spot to ensure peace among those people did not do their job? You know all the ramifications of this matter, Madam President, Your Honours. You know all the ramifications, and therefore you can know exactly what happened. Following this human tragedy, it was decided that this Court be set up, a Court which had to restore peace and reconciliation among the people of Rwanda. It is for that reason, Madam President, that you are here today and that we are also here to help you see to it that the people of Rwanda find peace and reconciliation once more, the peace and reconciliation which they so desperately need. Madam President, the short stay I have had amongst you, I would say a stay that has lasted less than 30 days, because it only lasted so long as there were Prosecution and Defence witnesses, during this short stay, Madam President, in all humility, I think you are the most appropriate persons through whom peace can be restored in Rwanda. Madam President, Your Honours, as I said, I followed you, your deliberations, for the short stay I had with you, and I noticed that you are attentive and that neither political concerns, nor concerns of friendly relations, would cause you to render a decision that will be counter to the reconciliation of the people of Rwanda. Madam President, Your Honours, as I said earlier on, unless one is really of bad faith, one cannot say that there were no massacres in Rwanda during the period April-July 1994. These events occurred suddenly, Madam President, and I believe that during the period in question, nobody was -- or knew that there will be a trial and therefore nobody thought it necessary to gather all the evidence, which evidence could have helped you to render a decision on the basis of evidence. What happened? The world was shocked by the events which occurred in Rwanda, Madam President, Your Honours. And justice had to be rendered; the guilty had to be punished. But as I said a while ago, Madam President, Your Honours, there was no evidence. Consequently, it was thought that to ensure reconciliation, it was necessary to prosecute those who represented the institutions of that country at that time. What I'm saying is not an invention. In the Cyangugu case, we heard a witness, a certain Paul Dobbie, who testified that in that case it was difficult to have evidence because not having been able, as I said a while ago, to have evidence, a sketch was prepared, and on the basis of that sketch, prosecutions were instituted against ministers, préfets, bourgmestres, and so on and so forth. That witness said in the Cyangugu case that it became necessary to arrest those persons and thereafter gather evidence, and that is why people who had to come to prove the Prosecutor's allegations were often those who were -- who knew the reality. Madam President, I believe that in that context, Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, who I here represent today, it is in that context that Gacumbitsi was arrested and that he appears before you today to answer to five counts: Genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity, murder, rape, and extermination. Madam President, I would hold it against myself if I started by elaborating on the argument that -- or elaborating on the credibility of witnesses without presenting to the Court who Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre, was. Because, Madam President, when I would have finished, when I would have finished introducing Mr. Gacumbitsi -- as I was saying, when I would have finished presenting Gacumbitsi, Madam President, Your Honours, I believe that you will know that the person before the Court today did not commit the crimes with which he is charged. Madam President, if you look at the indictment, that indictment does not enable you to know who the person appearing before you today is. In the indictment it is said that the Accused was born in 1947. This leads me to believe, Madam President, that there is a confusion between this witness and a certain Gacumbitsi, Samson, who lived in Kibungo préfecture. At the time the Accused was arrested, the said Gacumbitsi, Samson, was in custody in Kibungo. Well, that doesn't matter, Madam President. Today you have before you Mr. Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre, who was born in 1943 in Rusumo commune. Madam President, Your Honours, he is married and a father of six children. He is married; he is a Catholic, Christian, a practising Catholic. Madam President, this Accused whom I have just described briefly lost his father at a very early age, and it was his mother who had the painful duty to raise this child. He was Hutu and, Madam President, we know that at that time those who were entitled to education were the Tutsi. Everyone has their faith or destiny, and the Tutsi chiefs at that time, having seen that Gacumbitsi had a promising future, a Tutsi chief did everything to enrol him in a school -- or, rather, that Tutsi chief calls Gacumbitsi's parents to enrol him in a school. When he completed or graduated from that school, which is very near the parents' home, he pursued his education, Madam President, Your Honours, at the Catholic mission of Nyabitare. It is in that parish that a massacre occurred on 15 April 1994. Madam President, this man who was educated thanks to Tutsi assistance, thanks to the assistance from the Catholic mission, could he be against the Tutsi? Could he join or be the instigator of the attack that took place in this parish? I do not think so, Madam President. Why don't I think so, Madam President, Your Honours? He completed his studies. He became a teacher. And before this Court you heard people who came to tell you that if they were able to go to school, it was thanks to Mr. Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre. Before this Trial Chamber, Madam President, Your Honours, you were told that Gacumbitsi's friends were, above all, Tutsi, were mainly Tutsi. TAW, TBC were mentioned. Another person with whom he joined in the sole business that he undertook, that is, brickwork, were all Tutsi. Madam President, that is a person being described to you today as being the person who was the cause of all the evil that befell Rusumo commune. Madam President, Mr. Gacumbitsi was appointed at the head of the commune, which was described here by Miss Alison Des Forges, a commune that was most abandoned by the government. Yet Mr. Gacumbitsi undertook to develop that commune. In 1975 he noticed that there was no bank in that commune. He created one. He noticed that there were -- there weren't enough schools for children. He created schools. He listened to his people. The Prosecutor told you that the Accused was somebody who enjoyed a vibrant social life. He shared a drink with everyone. How, therefore, could you think, Madam President, Your Honours, that somebody with such a background, somebody with such an education, with such a culture, ready to help everyone, could destroy what he built with his own hands; namely, the inhabitants of Rusumo commune?Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence submits that Mr. Gacumbitsi is that man and could not have been the cause of the evil experienced by his commune in April 1995. Yet, Madam President, he is appearing before you today because he was arrested and transferred to the prison in the UN detention facility in Arusha on the basis of an indictment prepared by Prosecution. Madam President, the Defence has gone through, has perused, that indictment, and have come to the conclusion that the conditions set out in Rule 17, 18, 47 and Article 20 <stage>(A)</stage> of the Statute have not been complied with. But before that, Madam President, Your Honours, I could tell you, without wanting to imitate any -- not because I do not think you know what an indictment represents -- I could tell you this so that you should be able to know or have this definition before you when I am going to analyse the said indictment. As you know, Madam President, Your Honours, an indictment is the linchpin by which the Tribunal is seized, and you cannot, Madam President, Your Honours, render a decision except on the basis of what is alleged on the indictment. In my jurisdiction and according to the law which I practise, it is said the Court is seized in rem and in persona. I was saying, Madam President, Your Honours, -- I was talking about this indictment, how it is presented. Madam President, I know we are constrained by time, but I will summarise what an indictment should be. In the quotation I referred to earlier on, it is said that an indictment should, in a detailed manner, clearly state the facts with which the Accused is charged. It is said that -- well, it follows from this provision that the drafting of the facts must be done with clarity, with accuracy, must be accurate and concise. If we look at the indictment, Madam President, the indictment we have before us, we notice at a first glance that the Prosecutor is prosecuting Gacumbitsi as a main perpetrator of genocide and as an accomplice in genocide and also an accomplice for crimes in -- or crimes against humanity. Legally speaking, Madam President, Your Honours, when we talk of a main charge and a charge in the alternative, first of all, the allegations constituting the main charge must be explained, and if it is noticed that those allegations are untenable, then you are asked to characterise those allegations in the alternative. But what do we see here in the indictment, Madam President? The Prosecutor alleges as follows: that the acts of genocide, which is the main charge, is explained by the evidence which would be given with respect to complicity, complicity in genocide. This is not normal drafting, Madam President, and all of this, as I said a while ago, seems to us that the Prosecutor initially, when he prepared his indictment, did not know where to start from and thought, "Well, I have a duty to perform. I have a sketch to follow. First of all, I'm going to arrest Mr. Gacumbitsi and thereafter the Court is going to find its way." But this is not the way -- this is not how to go about it. When one proceeds in that manner, that is to prevent you from rendering just, fair, equitable justice. Still with regard to this indictment, Madam President, Your Honours, I told you a while ago that it emerges from the indictment that the Accused you have before you was born in 1947 in Rusumo, without further explanations. Whereas the Prosecutor is duty bound to explain to you, to enable you to know whom you are convicting and therefore has given you -- or gives you the full identity of the detainee. If you consider only this indictment, you may convict a certain Gacumbitsi, Sylvestre, who allegedly is born in 1947, but as I told you a while ago, the person appearing before you, Madam President, is born in 1943. The Court has not been given the names of the Accused's parents. And if you had to enter a conviction by default, you will have problems arresting or knowing the person you have convicted or you would have convicted somebody other than the person you should have convicted. And in an international court like yours, there is no right to such errors. Such errors should not be committed. Still in this indictment, Madam President, Your Honours, while the Prosecution is duty bound to disclose to the Accused detailed allegations, when we are talking of detailed allegations, this means that in the indictment the Prosecutor, when he alleges a fact, must specify the place of occurrence of the alleged acts, the date, when the alleged acts were committed, the person who allegedly committed the said acts, and the person or persons who allegedly committed the said acts with the Accused. However, Madam President, Your Honours, if we look at the indictment, the indictment before us, the Prosecutor very often does not specify the person with whom the Accused allegedly perpetrated the acts with which he is charged. When the Prosecution tells you, Madam President, that the Accused committed the acts with which he's charged with the policemen of his commune, Prosecution, for example, gives you two names which very often are repeated. These names are, for example, Kazoba and Berakumenyo. Madam President, this is not enough. Why is this not enough? Because there are many people who bear the same name and there is a risk, Madam President, Your Honours, that the Accused may not know in the preparation of his Defence who he allegedly perpetrated the acts, if at all he did commit them. Madam President, you will notice in this indictment that the Prosecutor uses expressions like "the", "towards", "at a certain date in the course of the month of April." It is vague, Madam President; it is not specific. Madam President, Your Honours, I had said earlier that we were before an international court. This Court, Madam President, has primacy over all other courts in the world, and when one is before such a court, he or she needs to be a bit more serious. We, Madam President, did point out these defects before this Court. We did so in 2002. We were seeking that some counts be withdrawn. We further sought an amendment of the indictment. What were we told in response to that application on our part? The Prosecutor told us, "Well, we will see about this at the end. That decision will lie -- or that determination will lie with the Judges. It will lie with them to choose between genocide and complicity in genocide." Madam President, just to mention a few examples of the vagueness, or might I say the emptiness, of this indictment? I would like to refer to paragraphs of the indictment. In one of the paragraphs --</p>

            <p>It reads, "On or about 9 April 1994 Sylvestre Gacumbitsi convened a meeting of all the conseillers de secteur, responsables de cellule and party chiefs of MRND and CDR in Rusumo commune. The meeting was held at the bureau communal, and at that meeting, Bourgmestre Sylvestre Gacumbitsi announced that weapons would be distributed for purposes of the extermination of the Tutsi population."You would notice, Madam President, that the Prosecutor does not make mention of the names of the conseillers de secteur or of the responsables de cellule or even of the party chiefs of the MRND and CDR in Rusumo commune. He could have done so, Madam President. He had every possibility to do so. He had all the material and human means to so proceed. He could have done so to prove the fact that -- or to establish the fact that that meeting did take place and that all those persons mentioned did participate, and maybe provide even a list of those who attended the meeting. Madam President, as I told you earlier, since the business of the Prosecutor, or the duty of the Prosecutor, was to fill in the empty spaces in his sketch, he just threw everything at you, just about anything. Madam President, Your Honours, if I now move on to Paragraph 7 of the indictment, the Prosecutor says as follows, "On or about 12 April 1994, after conferring with Major Ndekezi, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi ordered soldiers and boatmen along the lakes in Gisenyi secteur to stop refugees in flight from escaping across the border into Tanzania." Madam President, Major Ndekezi, would that be enough information? Madam President, Your Honours, can -- with that type of information, can the Accused be able to defend himself? Major Ndekezi belonged to which unit in the army? At the time these events occurred, was Major Ndekezi at the military camp in Rwanteru? Madam President, when the Rwanteru camp was described to your Court, one, a senior officer could not be there as a person in charge of such a small camp, and at any rate, Madam President, the Prosecution did not make it possible for the Accused to know whomsoever he met in the event he met so-called Ndekezi or anyone belonging to the army on that date, namely, the 12th of April 1994.Madam President, you would then understand that this indictment is so vague that you cannot use it without running the risk of delivering unfair justice. And if we move further in this indictment, Madam President, we notice that the Prosecutor has put in everything, a hodgepodge. In the indictment the Prosecutor has made mention of events which do not incriminate this accused person. Madam President, the Prosecutor has included in this indictment facts which have not been alluded to subsequently, which have clearly not been proven. I made mention earlier on, Madam President, of this Tutsi lady who was an erstwhile friend of the accused person and who, at the time of the events, sought refuge at the Accused's house and it is claimed in the indictment that he failed to accommodate that lady and, instead, killed her and her three children. That is what you were told this morning by the Prosecutor. Such events could be explained, or one can put it to the massacres that occurred, in Kanyogote <stage>(sic).</stage> But the Prosecutor did not dare to go further. He didn't even dare to tell you how many children Kanyogote had or whether Kanyogote suddenly became a woman. All of this, Madam President, is merely to emphasise the fact that the indictment before you is a mere hodgepodge of events which the Prosecutor finds difficult to prove. Madam President, the indictment before you clearly carries or bears incurable defects. Why do I say these defects are incurable? Because from the trial -- pre-trial proceedings and right up to the stage that we are at today, the Prosecutor didn't deem it necessary to seize your Court for a reconsideration of this indictment. He was allowed under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. If he failed to do so, it was because he was aware that he could not so proceed. And he was merely putting it in and saying, "Well, you're on your own," and it will lie with your conscience to convict someone who is innocent. He does not provide you with the details of the facts. He does not provide you with the evidence. He just says, it is the Court. It is yourself, Madam President, Your Honours, who would bear that heavy responsibility of convicting someone who a priori is not guilty. What does he say from the very beginning? This morning, he told you that you could correct, rectify, this indictment. He told you that this could be done taking into account the statements by witnesses -- sorry, the testimonies of witnesses before your Court, taking into account the briefs that have been filed; that is, after the Accused has already been kept in detention. And I say to you, Madam President, that this cannot be done. Otherwise, you would be bringing shame to the institution that you represent. Madam President, we are here to assist you, the Prosecution and the Defence alike, to hand down the law and to assist you. We are duty bound, whether it be on the side of the Defence or the Prosecution, we are duty bound to provide you with the facts, with the events, with what charges are brought against the Accused. We are bound to provide you with an indictment that contains all those facts as provided by law. This morning you were told that you can proceed without all these. That cannot be done; you cannot do so. A lot of rulings have been handed down along those lines, Madam President.Madam President, I was saying that rulings have been handed down according to which a vague indictment, a hodgepodge, a combination of confused events, cannot stand and amount to grounds for the conviction of an Accused person. It has been ruled and held here, Madam President, that you cannot rectify or regularise the defects inherent in this indictment through closing arguments either made by the Prosecution or anyone else, or evidence that can be provided ex poste facto. Madam President, these are included in the Kupreskic judgement dated 23 October 2001. That same application, Madam President, was applied on the 25th of February 2004 in the Cyangugu judgement. You cannot differ. It is the same Court. If the Prosecution want to assist you in delivering a fair judgement, it would have had to review its indictment, and it had time to do so, particularly that ourselves at the time, in 2002, we had raised this matter. He could have picked up what we had suggested, but since he didn't do so, those facts that are vague in the indictment -- I mean, you can follow the Prosecutor. You will place yourself in a state of ridicule. You cannot waver from what had been handed down, both by this Court and by the Appeals Chamber, in 2001. That having been stated, Madam President, I remained convinced that in view of the ability you have demonstrated, listening to us, you will not allow yourselves to be dragged along by the bad faith on the part of the Prosecutor, and that is why, Madam President -- that is why we rely on you, on your experience in matters judicial, to rule that the indictment that is brought before you is defective and therefore will not be considered in determining the conviction of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi; in other words, Madam President, in the silence of your chambers, Madam President, Your Honours, you would peruse this document, you would sift it, and in your soul and conscience you would say what needs to be said. This morning, Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecution -- and I believe tangentially -- talked to you about the credibility of Prosecution witnesses -- sorry, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses. Madam President, I will not be going back to talk about all the witnesses. In our briefs that have been submitted here, we dwelt -- in some 20 or 30 pages, we dwelt on the credibility of witnesses who paraded before your Court. I agree with the Prosecutor when he said at the outset, Madam President, when he said that all my witnesses who were former detainees, their testimony would need to be considered over and over. He also told you, Madam President, that the Defence witnesses are not credible. Madam President, we cannot place on the same standing or lend the same weight to the credibility of the testimony -- to the testimony of detainees, of killers, on the same level as citizens who are law abiding. It is along this path that the Prosecutor would like to take you, that is, in view of the witness testimonies. For our part, Madam President, we are saying that the Prosecutor's witnesses are not credible. Madam, in regard to the former detainees who came here as witnesses, the Prosecutor quite sincerely did tell you not to take into account their testimony. So I shall not unduly dwell on the cases of those witnesses, and even if I had to do so, Madam President, I would say to you that all those fellows are people with a skeleton, and I would like to draw your attention to the circumstances under which those witnesses were placed on provisional release. And among those witnesses, there are people who are still to undergo trial. But I would be blaming myself, Madam President, if I did not make reference to Witness TBH. We said, Madam President -- we submitted, Madam President, that that witness had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and had lost his civic rights, or had forfeited his civic rights. And it was as a result that we requested you -- we urged you -- not to consider the statements or testimony made by that witness. In our brief, Madam President, that you have with you, we quoted Rule 66, 66 <stage>(iii)</stage> of the Rwandan penal code. It is a law applicable to all Rwandan citizens and it states as follows: "Conviction that is accompanied by forfeiture of civic rights makes it impossible for such a Rwandan citizen to be an expert or to testify before the courts except in a case where mere information needs to be provided." Yet, Madam President, when this witness appeared before your Court, he took the oath before proceeding with his testimony, so you didn't hear him as a mere witness or for mere information purposes. He could not be heard in view of the fact that he had been convicted and had accordingly forfeited his civic rights, so he should have testified without taking the oath. Madam President, that is in regard to the conviction of Witness TBH. When that witness was heard by the Court, there were changes in such testimony, in the evidence he gave. There was a sentence that he -- something he said here, and it stuck in my mind. When he was talking about weapons, he told -- he told the Court, "I am telling the truth. This time around, I am telling the truth. I am not aware of the distribution of weapons." If we seek to interpret that testimony, what would it really mean, Madam President? It would mean that, from time to time, TBH witness did tell lies and he repeated -- he merely repeated what the Prosecutor told him on a Friday, before appearing before your Court on a Monday. The Prosecutor might have told him to lie and he said, "No, this time around I am going to tell the truth."</p>

Madam President, I am making my closing arguments and the Prosecutor has no right to interrupt me, because what I have said in no manner would, for instance, disclose the identity. It's, Madam President, an attempt to make me lose the trend of my thoughts and not be able to say the law as it should be.

            <p>So, Madam President, I was saying -- I was talking about the attitude of Witness TBH during his testimony before this Court. TBH is an ex-convict who has lost his civic rights and, therefore, he is an impeachable witness and his allegations therefore -- his testimony therefore, cannot help you in coming to a determination. And that is why I am saying that contrary to what the Prosecutor said this morning, Madam President, Witness TBH is not a credible witness and his testimony -- his testimony is not beyond a reasonable doubt. I will say the same thing with respect to the other witnesses who are all ex-convicts, but you will tell me, Madam President, Your Honours, that the other witnesses have not lost their civic rights. The Defence has given proof in their submissions, and if I may come back to that -- if I were to come back to that, we will take a lot of the Court's time. The Prosecution also referred to Witness TAQ. The Defence also made submissions on the credibility of that witness. **Madam President, Your Honours, it was alleged before this Trial Chamber that the woman in question is ... ... .... .... ... ... ... .</p>

            <speaker>MS. MBATTANG:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I was saying that the person I referred to gave a description -- gave an account of events, an account which a normal person cannot give. What did she say throughout her testimony? She was pregnant, she testified, a pregnancy that had come to full term. And we know that a pregnant woman, a woman who's been pregnant for nine months is very tired. But this very woman told this Court that she was in Nyarubuye on the 14th, that she was at the parish on the 15th, that she hid herself, together with other persons, in a kernel. And in that kernel, according to the witness, there were several victims lying on the witness. The same woman, according to her testimony, got up at mid-night with the help of her mother, sometimes with the help of her mother -- sometimes with the help of her mother, sometimes with the help of her aunt-in-law. And early in the morning she is the one who went to go and see people come and finish off the survivors. Your Honours, Madam President, it is the same woman who the assailants flushed out of a classroom. The assailants would not kill her although they came to kill all the survivors. The assailants asked her to wait on the spot so that they would first of all go and loot before coming back to kill her. The woman leaves the classroom, and takes refuge sometimes near a river, if we refer to her statements during the preliminary investigations, and sometimes under a bridge. And under the said bridge, the woman sees vehicles passing by. She hears people who are speaking over loudspeakers. The witness, Madam President, Your Honours, specified that when the vehicles were passing she recognised the driver of the Accused but did not see the Accused, and only recognised the person she said she recognised through that person's voice. This description or this account of events is not normal. Already at the parish she fled and yet still heard, through the loud speaker, the Accused who was saying that the Tutsi should be killed. Such an account, Madam President, is an exaggerated account and you cannot take it into consideration. In view of all this without revisiting all the contradictions and inconsistencies in our testimonies, the Defence submits that Witness TAQ, contrary to the Prosecution's assertions, is not credible. Still this morning, Madam President, Your Honours, Prosecution talked about Witness TAS. TAS's testimony was also inconsistent. On the 13th of April in Nyakarambi the witness testified, "I did not -- I was not present up to the end of the meeting but I was able to hear what Sylvestre Gacumbitsi said." The same witness told this Court that during the night at Rusumo where there is neither electricity nor any other facility, at a place where she was hiding, she heard a certain Kazoba who said that the Accused had asked that all the Tutsi be killed before the 14th. Madam President, I would hold it against myself if I failed to draw your attention to the fact that before this Court the witness, Witness RDR testified that she was among those who were approached and trained by Ibuka in order to come and support the conviction of the Accused. In view of all this, Madam President, how can this Court hold that this witness only testified to what she saw? The same witness, Madam President, told the Court that on the 16th, while she was fleeing from the assailants, she went into a compound where she stayed in order to follow the acts of the Accused who was supposed to be in Nyarubuye according to the testimony of TAO. Madam President, we have given you facts which enable you to enter a finding that this witness is not credible beyond a reasonable doubt. Madam Witness <stage>(sic),</stage> another credible witness that the Prosecutor referred to this morning is TAO. We heard the testimony of this witness before this Trial Chamber. It is that witness who arrived at the parish after the events of Nyarutunga. The witness spent eight hours to find her family. The witness finally finds her family, she puts them in a classroom and in the morning, without any reason, she leaves that classroom in order take refuge in a latrine belonging to the school. And from that latrine, a pit latrine, Madam President, a latrine that had a closed door whose walls were made of earth, the witness was able to see the Accused, the Accused who was accompanied by other persons. Those persons still have to be determined -- still have to be known. They went to finish off the survivors who were at Nyarubuye parish. The witness testified that she had two or three children, his wife and him. And for a whole day they stayed in a latrine. We do not know whether they were standing throughout the day, whether they were lying down. In any case, humanly, that -- such an operation is impossible, and that is why we are saying that the account given by this -- because of the account given by this witness, the witness cannot be credible. We now move on to the case of Witness TAK. TAK is the witness who before this Trial Chamber told or testified that -- that he went towards the house of Mr. Gacumbitsi in the company of Mr. Kanyogote and his children. That he went there at about 8 - 9 p.m. and that it was around 9:30 p.m. that he allegedly heard the cries of Kanyogote from Mr. Gacumbitsi's house, and that subsequently or thereafter, he saw a crowd of people coming out of that house. The witness fled and does not know whether Kanyogote was killed. The witness gave you an account of those events while TBH -- or even though TBH told you that on the 14th, at about 9:00 a.m, a certain gentleman came to meet him with the bicycle of Mr. Kanyogote and told him that Mr. Kanyogote had just been arrested and that he was sure that he was going to be killed. This was at 9 a.m., Madam President, I would like to specify that. Witness EZ. Witness EZ, a Defence witness, told this Court that -- that he went to Kavuzo's cellule and that -- on that date between 9:00 -- or, rather, 10:30 and 11 o'clock, and he was told that his friend Kanyogote had just been killed. Madam Witness -- Madam President, sorry, Witness TAK, who at 11 p.m. sees someone who certainly had been killed in the morning, can that person -- can such a witness's testimony be credible? That is why Witness TAK is not credible, especially as Witness EZ told you that he saw bodies, dead bodies. Madam President, on a balance of probabilities, the Defence witnesses -- or if you compare the Defence witnesses to the Prosecution witnesses, as I told you earlier on with respect to the majority of Prosecution witnesses, Defence witnesses were citizens living in peace. He told you that NG2 ZIZ, ZEZ, ZHZ and UPT are not credible. The Prosecution tried to explain to the Court why they thought that ZEZ, ZHZ could not be credible. Madam President, the Defence demonstrated at length that these witnesses are credible. Why? The Prosecution relied, above all, on two events: One, the Prosecution alleged that ZHZ could not be credible because before this Trial Chamber that witness denied having been convicted for the murder of his household servant. The Defence submits, and strongly argues, that this witness has never denied that he was convicted. What this witness did before this Trial Chamber, is that he refused to say in open session what had happened to him. The witness told you that he may say what happened to him in a closed session, and you would recall, Madam President, Your Honours, that when we moved into a closed session, without any insistence, as the Prosecution alleges, that witness told you the circumstances under which he was detained, under which he was detained provisionally; he specified that. Because as regards the charge of murder as alleged by the Prosecution, under Rwandan criminal code, when one kills, that person is liable to a death penalty and not a penalty of three years imprisonment. The witness explained that he had been detained for three years. And, in any case, the Prosecution, which at the time of the events pretended that -- or purported that they had evidence, did not tender any evidence or judgment by which Witness ZHZ was convicted, but the witness said he had been detained and when one is detained, that does not at all affect the credibility of the person detained -- of the witness. Especially as the witness explained that he was detained, that he did not commit the acts or crimes of which he was charged, but simply because it happens that one may be detained. It may happen that a person is accused and that time is taken before you are asked to explain what happened. Madam President, Your Honours, I submit that this witness did not vary his testimony in spite of his state of health. The witness testified, and as I said a while ago, he did not vary his testimony. This morning, the Prosecution told this Court that the witness was not credible because the witness alleged that he did not see a dead body in Nyarubuye where there was a massacre, but the witness told you the circumstances. The witness testified before this Trial Chamber to the circumstances under which he left the parish. The witness stated that he was compelled to be at the parish as soon as the attack was launched. The witness took advantage of the ensuing disorder to go into hiding. From a human standpoint, Madam President, somebody who goes into hiding when an attack has been launched, can such a person see a dead body? Because people die only after there has been shooting. This carries no weight, the fact that a person says that he did not see a dead body and you are told that the person is not credible because there was massacre. And if the massacre occurred after his departure, if people died only after that witness's departure, Madam President, I do not see how you could cast doubt on the credibility of that witness. The Defence therefore submits, Madam President, Your Honours, that this witness has given you an account which is beyond a reasonable doubt, and his credibility is beyond reproach. Madam President, it was also purported that the other Defence witness, that is Witness NG2, was not credible either. That he wasn't credible because he testified that when he arrived in Nyarubuye, he did not see any corpse --</p>

            <p>When that witness testified before this Court, he said that he saw a dead body outside. That was during his testimony in chief and that, in any case, there were many people who died in Nyarubuye. If that allegation is dismissed, the testimony of Witness NG2 -- or, rather, the testimony of Witness NG2 is beyond doubt, is credible. Regarding Witness ZIZ, and I think this witness -- rather, we have made submissions on this witness in our written brief and we reply on what we said in our written brief regarding this witness. Madam President, Your Honours, this morning the Prosecutor talked about Witness UHT. In our brief, we have dwelt at length -- we have shown that this witness is credible. Madam President, Your Honours, having shown that through all these credible witnesses the -- we have shown through these witnesses the credibility of our case and we have confidence that in this matter you will only render fair -- a fair decision, because the Prosecution has failed to adduce evidence that will lead to the conviction of this Accused. On this note, I will rest my case, and I regret to be leaving you because I would have liked to stay here a while longer to look at you, to admire you, because I know that peace, the peace that will be restored on this planet is in your hands and you will make every effort to successfully discharge your mission.

Since the 28th of July, you've always pointed out to me, Madam President, that from time to time I go faster than the Court, and from time to time I create problems for the court reporters and the interpreters. Everyone has criticised me. With those criticisms, what else is left? I believe you would be missing me, and when you feel you are going to be missing someone, then it is an opportunity to say au revoir. I have taken the opportunity to meet my Defence team and I promised my team that I would speak as carefully, as slowly as Ms. Mbattang. It's a challenge which I want to meet -- to take up. But when the Court will observe that in September 2003, I said that I would be finished by the 31st of October, and right from the very first days I did produce witnesses, the witnesses that were necessary. I'm all the more at ease, Madam President, when I did so because I am representing a convinced Christian, a good man whom I heard from the father, from the mother, from witnesses. Should such a Christian not make me proud? And under your guidance I want to say, yes, and I'm going to prove this by telling you a short story.When I got to Arusha in October 2001, Madam President, I had to have my ID prepared for me to have access to the Tribunal. The officer in charge of preparing my ID refused to do so because I do not have a first name. So someone intervened right from my own country and then finally I got an ID. It was necessary for me to have a pin code in order to be able to make a call, and the person in charge of the communication services also said if I didn't have a first name there is no way I'm going to get a pin code. And so I was lost, Madam President. But in spite of all, I stayed. I represent a man who has a name and a first name, but I think it is a source of joy. Beyond our profession, beyond our occupation, what is left? It is the man, a man as a whole. It is that man, the homo, that -- whose character they sought to taint, to damage, but not in an intelligent way, Madam President. I do remember that when I was very young in school we used to go to the movies, and we were -- I don't know what it was -- I don't remember the title of the film but it did talk about the fact that no crime is perfect. Indeed, no crime is perfect. In 1994 Mr. Gacumbitsi couldn't have imagined that he would be here. In 1994 Gacumbitsi was convinced, if he had committed anything, would be among the conquerors if you were to go along with the Prosecutor's thesis.In 1995, if it was true that it was the Hutus who wanted to eliminate the Tutsis, they couldn't imagine at some point in time they would be in prison. So that is the story of history. It's like the minaeval doctrine which takes on its flight when the evening is sounding or appearing. All those who are in prison, well, what did they do in 1994? The Prosecutor tells you, and Ms. Mbattang says it with soft words; I will say it crudely, and allow me. Well, I will bring all these facts to you and then we'll see, we'll see who participated and who was not involved. But in our case, the Prosecutor did not exhibit that much bad faith. Right from the very beginning the Prosecutor knew what he was doing. I am not under estimating him, I am merely drawing your kind attention to the fact that in this case, the Prosecutor prosecuted or brought Gacumbitsi to court for genocide. All other counts are in the alternative. Subsidiarily, even if you look at the first page or the second page, you are going to see the same thing. Madam President, I'm looking at you while saying so. In some legal systems when they say in the main, and then we shift to the alternative, it's a way of saying, "Well, we are not too sure of the main charge. Don't allow the criminal to go away, just look at it even if the main charge cannot stand, maybe in the alternative, maybe something should be done about it." And in other systems, the one I know that you practised, that I also practice, they say, "If by some extraordinary happening," and that's the usual answer. ^^On more than one occasion the Prosecution answered -- that was the answer that the Prosecutor gave to Judge Reddy this morning. There might have been some minor defects but -- Now, in business law, or in civil law or even in criminal law, and more specifically, when it comes to matters that come within the jurisdiction of this Court, it might be mistaken but it is a life sentence, and if one is lucky, there might be a time frame. Now, the Accused person that we -- I represent and the Prosecution - well, each and every one of us has to act, and I said so on the 6th October before this Court. I did say that each and every one had to make an effort to ensure that we did not violate the laws of the republic, we do not violate the laws of a monarchy. And that in the event there was a violation, it was human rights that were violated. And what -- who is the human? It's yourself, myself and each and everyone. And there is violation when there is death. And before death, there is total equality. There is no Prosecutor, no Defence counsel, there is no minister, there is no president of the court; there are only dead bodies. No society in the world has the right to cause the death of anyone else of his neighbour. Madam President, I thought Ms. Anne Ngatio Mbattang, after having told you that the indictment was defective and there was nothing in it, she was going to ask you to acquit Gacumbitsi, but I do understand her. Because if we stop at this level, a lot of people will think that we are afraid to address the issues or the facts or the events. The Prosecutor didn't put anything into his indictment. Unfortunately, he cannot do anything, but for us, we are trying to challenge what he had done. And what did he do after that? That is, he brought people who are likely to prove, correct, to fabricate a number of things that could not appear in the indictment. And the first person to appear before you -- and this is what is worrying about this trial -- is Patrick Fergal Keane, a BBC journalist, BBC correspondent in 1994 who was based in South Africa. That man, from the 28th to the 29th, came and engaged in advertising his footage, his film, but that advertisement was unwelcome, not only because he was the one involved, but just because that footage was strewn with lies, with fabrications. Why, Madam President, Your Honours? Because at no time in the course of his testimony -- and I challenge anyone -- at no time did Patrick Keane tell us that these were two films three years difference: 27th of June 1994 and 18th of June 1987 -- 18th February 1997. That journalist never told us. On the contrary, we were shown footages that were silent and Patrick Fergal Keane then started explaining the contents of the footages.Madam President, this is a critical issue because in 1994 -- and I had pointed it out earlier; I hope I had been followed -- Gacumbitsi had to be very powerful. He was the bourgmestre, he was the administrator, but at no point in time was he thinking of being the object of prosecution. And in 1994 Fergal Keane did say so here, and I made mention of that particular section in my briefs before you. He said that he had been sent on assignment in Rwanda and he found himself at the Benaco camp in Tanzania because of the charges that were brought or that were weighing on Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. Your Honours, I had -- and I waited in vain to hear those charges being brought in 1994 and who were bringing any such charges, I didn't get anyone. Madam President, when we watched those pictures, there were two soldiers, permanently there in uniform, carrying their weapons. Patrick Fergal Keane, you followed him live, he was the first witness. You all heard him. I don't want to waste time, too much of time, but tomorrow before you hand down your decision, please re-examine those tapes. You would notice that there was a translation of words the population were saying to Fergal Keane. The translator was Frank Dore <stage>(phonetic)</stage> of the RPF. At the time when I was saying in my introductory statement on the 6th of October 2003, that seemed to be pure literature, but when the forensic experts Le Conte and Deware <stage>(phonetic),</stage> who were in the forensic department or the coroner's department in Paris, when they made their testimony here, the Court noticed -- came to understand and then the Prosecutor said, "Well, let these same experts not come and explain all this here again." That they merely be tendered as exhibits because contrary to the testimonies of Fergal Keane, the experts did prove from footage 11 to 17 that there were three types of bodies at the Nyarubuye parish. It was the experts who detected the fact that the footage were taken at two different times. It was the experts, using their skills, their techniques, their scientific knowledge, with supporting and corroborating evidence, and this can be reviewed. These are matters that were brought before you here, that amongst the bodies that were photographed in 19 -- in May 1994 in Nyarubuye, there were skeletons which had gone as far back -- years back. Madam President, now that report is one of the materials produced by the Defence, does prove as appropriate that right from the very first Prosecution witness who appeared here, right from that first witness, we've never been told the reality as to occurrence of events. Madam President, I want -- I don't want to keep you here unduly. You told us that we do everything to finish as speedily, as expeditiously as possible. We shall and -- but we ask you respectfully, to note that what we are saying here today does not appear in our briefs. If I didn't do so at the beginning, it's because my regret to leave you takes over from whatever thing I had to do. After 25 years in this profession, I have had problems with my profession only in 2004, I mean, a counsel, even those who are my elders, how can we answer 134 closing brief from the Prosecutor in a couple of days? Please bear with us. I have all the respect required, but no one is bound to perform the impossible.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. I know that your Court did ensure that nothing is lacking. But that's the practice. It's very important, Madam President. Between what you decide and what we do, there is a significant gap and that's why we are saying, that, "Prosecutor you should have put all those crimes in the indictment instead of calling TAO, TAX, etc. to come and replace -- do the job that you should have done in your indictment. And these are things we cannot forget. Now, take TAO and TAX, those are the main witnesses, the star witnesses of the Prosecution in regard to events in Nyarubuye. I'm not going to go back there. Ms. Mbattang has said everything, the Prosecutor has said everything; I merely want to draw your attention. Then TAX got to the parish on the 12th, TAO got there on the 14th, TAQ got to the same parish on the 14th, and now we are here 1st of March 2004, ten years later, and these people never saw each other at the parish. I do accept, there were a lot of people on the 14th. On the 15th, TAX, TAO, TAQ were at the parish; they never saw each other and there was a crowd. Everyone does acknowledge that. And then on the 16th the whole thing changed. On the 16th there were just the survivors. On the 17th, just the survivors. And TAQ is among the survivors on the 30th; he doesn't see TAX or TAQ -- TA -- TAO. TAX is among the survivors on the 15th; he doesn't see all the others. Are we talking about the same parish, Madam President? But they all organised themselves to say, "I saw the bourgmestre, Gacumbitsi, arrive." That was TAX, "But he didn't kill anyone." That is his testimony. But how could it be otherwise? TAX says he gave a blow with a machete to the neck of Murefu. TAO says he took a machete and the others killed Orbegina, Murefu and Buhonogo. Madam President, I'm taking up this witness because that's -- it's on him that the Prosecutor stands, as it were, firmly. And Ms. Anne Ngatio Mbattang talks about unimpeachable witnesses. I don't know whether impeachable or not, I simply note that in law -- in the same place, on the same date they didn't see each other and didn't witness the same things or the same event. Madam President, I will not disclose the identity of anyone, but I will respectfully request you that in the secrecy, in the quiet of your Chambers and in the course of your deliberations -- I want to bring to an end this whole thing. Maybe I will get back to it when I will be talking about some of these minor offences that are brought in the alternative, but do note that out of the 40 paragraphs in the indictment that is vague and inaccurate, all the victims mentioned by the Prosecutor, none is recognised by any of the witnesses that appeared here. The witnesses came each with each or her own victims, and the Prosecutor says, "Well, the Defence did not deny, they even accepted." Please, let's understand ourselves, I don't know what we accepted. Madam President, I prepared Gacumbitsi's Defence on the basis of the indictment that was given me, and I was convinced Under Rule 47 all these charges were listed before the confirming Judge signed the indictment. That was not the case, and the consequences have to be drawn by the Court. It need not be told that this was not said or this was said. And, Ms. Mbattang did say, right from the 10th of November, we did ask the Court whether this indictment could not be modified so that it can be worth its source. Madam President, there were Prosecution witnesses whom the Prosecutor didn't want to talk about this morning. Now, it's not only Fergal Keane, there was TAW and I want to talk about him, Madam President, because if there is any witness who might have had some credibility, if there was some witness who was believable, who might have experienced a particular event, our everyday life, you have your cook, you have your gardener --</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I fully understand you, Madam President, but I am still standing by my commitment. I haven't got there yet. I was saying that in our everyday life, Madam President, we who are bound to have aids, you have people like your cook, your gardener and your driver. When one of those people comes and tells us that your shirt was not washed in the morning, it's because he knew that the last time it was washed and he saw you wear it and he could identify the places where -- the spots where there were stains, but then I understand you, Mr. Prosecutor. I am even of the same view, but in your situation, you must leave no stone unturned so as not to disappoint people. Well, you dealt with what you had with you, but one of the things on which we wonder right up to this day, and I believe that we will still be unrequited right to the time when you make a decision, is in regard to paragraph 5. You said, "On or about the 9th of April, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi convened a meeting." That paragraph 5 is of such gravity. Why? Because in our own understanding of an indictment, it is our opinion that -- our view that the Prosecutor, not having witnessed these events, referred to people who witnessed those events and who provided him with the required information. But when you take the 9th of April with what is stated, you would notice that the only person who could have witnessed or participated in that meeting, that that person was only heard on the 20th of November 2002. That person was only heard on the 20th November 2002, the 1st and the 13th of May 2003. Now, how come somebody who was only heard in 2002, would then find his words mentioned or his statement mentioned on an indictment dated 20th of June 2001? I'm merely quoting Judge Reddy during the session. He asked the witness, "Why didn't you talk about this meeting in your statement?" He said, "Well, I just occurred -- it just occurred to me. And this is the first time it cropped up in my mind." So the only person who could have attended that meeting, he spoke about it in this courtroom. The other fabricator, the man who is jealous, the fellow who did not succeed, who dared to tell you that he was a civil servant, he was this or that, what did he tell you? He said he got it from the person who came and testified before you and who had never spoken about it previously. It is the same witness who would tell you that on the 8th of April 1994, a meeting was organised at a businessman's house in Kibungo in order to plan the crimes and the massacres and all these things that can be imagined. And, unfortunately, once more, he was rebutted by the Prosecutor through Exhibit D7. The Prosecutor produced the audio cassette, a cassette containing a programme of the Rwandan national radio, which talks about a meeting of the préfectural security committee. That witness was rendered naked. That is not all. That same witness came before you and said that if you talk about the carton of weapons it was because at the end of the meeting on the 9th, the only person who witnessed told him, allegedly so, that the issue was one of the distribution of weapons. And that same person came and said, "I never spoke it, I had never heard any mention made of it." That was not enough. That same witness told you that after the 12th of April the friend of the Accused never saw him again. And as I said, Madam President, that friend, fortunately, was summoned by the Prosecutor and he came here and said that on the 13th the Accused told her -- or him that he had been the object of victim of threats.</p>

            <stage>(continuing)</stage>
            <p>Now, when that witness was asked why he or she was scared on the 13th, he said he did so because the Accused wanted to kill him. And in the course of the cross-examination, when we said, "Well, you have been for years -- 50 years as friends, how could he do that?" He said, "Well, you know, the Accused didn't do anything for me. I had asked him to take care of my properties and my family, and he did nothing about it." "So are you sure that his children would take care of you?" He said, "Yes." He says, "Well, if he is convicted, his children will take care of me." And that is not all. He destroys himself. What does he say? He said, "On the 13th, my first night in Tanzania at the house of the sister of the Accused" -- and he said more than he saw. He said, "On the 14th, in the morning, I saw the Accused at Gisenyi following me." And lastly, he said -- to conclude his statement with regard to the second day, Madam President, he said, "I am not going to lie. Gacumbitsi did not know how to operate a firearm." These are people who misled the Prosecution. These are the slanderers who came before this Court, who came before this Court to do this man - unfortunately, for them it is not Gacumbitsi who was being prosecuted. It is the bourgmestre of Rusumbizi -- Rusumo, because, in any case, what is highlighted is the position he occupied. Madam President, Your Honours, I heard before this very Court this person say that on the 10th April they went to Kibungo military camp in order to receive weapons. On the whole they received 105 crates of weapons. I do not want to bring you back to the preliminary investigation where reference was made to crates, but in the Court the crates became boxes. And then we asked, "How did you know that they were weapons?" And the witness said, "I imagine what the other said." And the other said, "I never told him anything about that." The witness is going to change his statement, and the Prosecutor did say this morning, it is no longer the person whose name I am not going to mention, but since the Prosecutor said it this morning, it is Gaconda, Leonidas. But Gaconda, Leonidas, is not a conseiller de secteur, and, therefore, could not attend the said meeting. He was nothing. And being unable to attend the said meeting, he could not know what was said in that meeting. This is how an attempt was made to make up charges to be brought against Silvestre Gacumbitsi, and all the witnesses named by this person said that they were not aware of the distribution of weapons in their area. Madam President, Your Honours, the other witness whom you all know and who, for reasons of safety, I do not intend to mention either his name or his pseudonym, but I would like the Trial Chamber to understand that during cross-examination that woman strongly testified before this Trial Court that she was disappointed. She was disappointed to have been ... ... ... ... ... ... . She was disappointed -- </p>

            <p>I thank you, Madam President. This summary that I'm going to make, Madam President, is going to deal with the criminal responsibility of the Accused. Certainly it's also going to address sentencing as well as the penalty. Regarding the responsibility of the Accused, Madam President, we also elaborated on this in our written brief. We have submitted for your consideration that Gacumbitsi was not able, and could not be able to be at Nyarutunga market on the 14th, at the parish, the parish of Nyarubuye, on the 15th, at the parish on the 16th, at Kankobwa in Rubare cellule on the 17th. The reason why he was absent in those places is that, Gacumbitsi, as from the 13th in the evening, was threatened with death. The threats started with the release of the people he had arrested on the 11th and 12th, which people he locked up in the communal jail house. Faced with the threat of death, Madam President, my client, the Accused, said at the hearing of 21 November, before your Trial Chamber, I quote -- this was in answer to a question asked in the examination-in-chief, I quote: "I was hiding in my house. I was not able to run away from my country. I only asked the members of my family not to tell anyone that I was in the house. I would have given them instructions to the effect that anyone looking for me should be told that I was not there, and I did not leave my house." Madam President, during the questioning of the Accused, which questioning lasted two days, the Prosecution did not challenge the fact that the Accused was threatened with death. On the contrary, what Prosecution pointed out and interpreted it in their own manner was the answer given to Prosecution's question at the hearing of 25 November, paragraph 35, transcript page 23: "And you would like to make this Court believe that you were hiding in your house and that would have made you more vulnerable to any attack, isn't it?" Answer by the Accused: "Listen, to say that I was hiding in my house does not mean that I was indeed in my house, but I had asked the members of my family not to tell anyone where I was. This is what I said. This is what I asked the members of my family to say." The Accused said this for the first time on the 21st. "I gave them directives to the effect that anyone looking for me should be told that I was not there and I did not leave my house."Madam President, I think that this testimony by the Accused, or the Accused-cum-witness, does not call for any special comments because the testimony is clear. It speaks for itself. The Accused-cum-witness added something else, quote -- or, rather, when I asked him why he did not run away with his family, the Accused answered as follows: "I could not take refuge in that manner. I was waiting for the sous-préfet, the préfet, to do something, in order to ensure the safety or security of persons. If I had taken flight with my family, that would have been serious. I would have confirmed what people thought. People said, 'Well this is what we said. It is true. He has taken his family and has run away.' As a leader, I had some responsibilities; therefore, I could not have taken such a move." Page 46, paragraph 11 to 23, of the transcript of 21 November 2003. Madam President, Your Honours, I do not know whether Gacumbitsi was mistaken, but we heard that the last person to leave the boat when it is sinking is the captain, and I believe this is what Gacumbitsi sought to do, and he cannot be blamed for that. On the contrary, on the contrary, Madam President, and furthermore, the fact that he was threatened with death was not challenged, was not denied. Those who saw him -- and I'm compelled to come back to this -- the four ex-convicts who saw him saw him only on one date. All the prisoners saw him only on the 14th. Not any difference. And all of them saw him at 4 -- between 3 and 4 p.m., all of them. So, Gacumbitsi was not ubiquitous. He was a human being like anyone else. And I think the greatest regret on the part of the Accused, as he stated before your Court, is that -- well, and he said it, you will find it in his statements, the witness/Accused said that he is saddened; he's saddened because the people in Nyarubuye came to find refuge at a place they thought they would find peace. "They wanted protection. Yet they came to kill them in my commune without me being able to protect them." Gendarmes who came from Mulindi, assailants from Rukira; in other words, those who were pursuing the refugees came to kill them in his commune. That is the reality, and, Madam President, I thought that at the end of the Prosecution's closing arguments, or following the indictment, you would be told the following, that of the 10,000 Tutsis who were in Rusumo after the events of Nyarubuye, only 2,000 or 3,000 survived, but the Prosecution did not do that. In fact, those who took refuge at the church did not come from Rusumo. Witness TAO testified to that. Witness TAQ testified to that. They came from Rukira, Birenga and other places, and they were looking for a place where there was peace. Madam President, I even heard that two priests, Gisagara and Charles, came from Nyarubuye. No, these are priests that came from Rukira. But since Gacumbitsi had to be tarnished at all costs, they placed them, situated them in his commune. This is what I would say with respect to the indictment. Madam President, we know in law that there must be a reason, a motive, for any crime, to know who benefits from the crime. And we take -- we quote Alison Des Forges: "Rusumo looked like an abandoned plantation. What did the government do, the government of Habyarimana, Juvénal, for Rusumo, for Gacumbitsi? Gacumbitsi was not a member of the Akazu. Was it in his interest to kill the inhabitants of his commune or to kill those who had taken refuge there? Gacumbitsi was a weakened man. The most serious act, the act of the humiliation of a bourgmestre, was to see that those he had locked up were released, even though he was still bourgmestre." Madam President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi, from the 10th, the 11th, the 12th, arrested the criminals who dared to operate in Nyamugali, Gatore; everyone agrees on that; everyone knows that. Before him, Madam President, the other bourgmestre of Rwanda, says the Defence counsel, who dared -- I think the bourgmestre of Kigina, in the north or perhaps in the centre of Rwanda, this is what that bourgmestre did. And the Prosecutor said that since the Defence has succeeded to prove that personally Gacumbitsi did nothing, the Trial Chamber should convict him for the acts of his subordinates. Madam -- Madam President, we waited in vain for the Prosecution to tell us who the subordinates of Gacumbitsi were, which subordinates did whatever he alleges, but we didn't hear that. And he quoted Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> time and again. Madam President, Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> cannot apply as the Prosecutor believes. It is not a blanket article in which you can put everything. I'm not the first to say so. Your Trial Chamber has already said so. The bourgmestre is not the hierarchical superior of the secteur conseiller. When we talk about hierarchical superior, Madam President, you would be talking about somebody who effectively has the power to control and to direct and in particular, somebody who can impose disciplinary sanction on the subordinate. And even in that case, he should be aware of what his subordinate is doing. But you were told about secteur conseillers, the heads of cellules. The Prosecution even went to the extent of saying that Gacumbitsi supervised all the administrators of the local government in Kibungo; in other words, he was even above the préfet. We are still waiting. Perhaps during your deliberations you will be given the instruments appointing him to that position, but at our level that has not been disclosed to us.Madam President, as I told you -- perhaps I may have to revisit this in order to conclude -- murder. Murder here is another secondary crime, yet the Prosecution wants to prove murder through genocide. This is unthinkable. It isn't thinkable for murder to become an element of genocide. One could accept that, but to start from genocide in order to justify murder and extermination, I would say that this is gymnastics for which you need long-term training, and that we did not quite understand. But to be brief on this issue of assassination or murder, we are saying that what was said before you does not feature in the indictment, and this is not by chance. It is glaring. Now, on rape. We know and would assert the Tutsi problem in 1994 in Rwanda became a routine theme, a commonplace argument. The Defence called before you young girls, Tutsi mothers, Tutsi women, who have never been raped. Madam President, how come it is that the Prosecutor up to this time did not think that Gacumbitsi housed a young girl whom he saved, and that young girl came here to testify before you? Why did he omit that? That is the truth. It doesn't disturb anyone. TAS claims that she was raped, and she testified before your Court that she never heard from Gacumbitsi giving orders to rape women. Who better than that witness can say what Gacumbitsi did not do? As an anecdote -- I thought this chapter was closed but the Prosecutor brings me back to it -- I'm referring to TAP. I would not come back to what has already been submitted; however, this person said during her -- during the preliminary investigations that she was assaulted by the former employees of his father, Athanase, Calixte, and others, and this was said -- or, rather, she was assaulted on the 9th of April, but the Trial Chamber said that -- when it was said that it was after the events of Nyarubuye that she was assaulted. That appears to me extraordinary. Madam President, one of my colleagues talks about traversing the desert. Now, I don't want to dwell unduly, but let me say the Prosecutor made a lot of effort in order to comply with the legal requirements. He failed to prove genocide; he fell back on complicity. He failed to prove complicity; he then relied on rape, murder, et cetera. But still he did not stand. At the last minute, in his closing arguments, he pulled out something that is extremely dangerous, and for the first time in writing he talked about judicial notice and he made reference to the Semanza case. We believe for our part that that should not be held by you -- should not attract your attention. The Chamber has had occasion to rule that judicial notice would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. It cannot apply -- it cannot be applied in a blanket manner. It cannot be generalised. Alison Des Forges came here with no specific report. She said that she did not even know that there was a sous-préfecture in Rusumo. So what did she come to do here? Madam President, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi thinks and believes that this Court has circumscribed, understood, his personality, but the charges with which he is charged, those five counts fabricated over TV, over the radio, on Internet, and then gives birth, I wouldn't say, to a mouse. Such charges of such seriousness are withering, fading away, and I understand the Prosecutor took hours on end to submit these charges, and then at the end say, one hour would be too much. I can understand, because not only hearing both parties, one really wondered what was left of this case. But we are the ones -- we are not the ones who pass judgement. We don't know the law. The only people who know the law is the Bench, yourselves. And the only request we make of you is to acquit Gacumbitsi, acquit him of those five counts that have been wrongly brought or laid against him. But since we are not parties to your deliberations, and all we are doing is submitting our respective positions, which are not less legal, we are saying to you, if by some extraordinary happening, you hold the opinion that beyond what has been said by either party, that beyond the defects, there was the least doubt in regard to the conduct of the Accused, Madam President, Your Honours, please act in such a manner that this man, among all the others that you will be trying, appearing before you -- maybe the Chamber is not aware of this -- I think and I believe if Gacumbitsi is not the only one, if he is the only person whose family remained in the same house in Rusumo, in Rwanda, and this man wants to go back to his family. Madam President, I don't know how criminals behave. I just wish to suggest to your Trial Chamber anybody who blames himself and who wants to protect himself, the very last thing the person has is his children. The children of Gacumbitsi are in Rusumo. Some have gone to university. Others are there. No member of the Gacumbitsi family is hiding in any other country. They are there. And I will say -- I was saying that if ever the Chamber considers that there might be some blame to be laid at Gacumbitsi's door, it should be light. Madam President, what can I do? The law requires that I represent Gacumbitsi right up to the sentencing phase. Please act so that if there are two or three penalties, that he be able to serve just one. Maybe I'm betraying myself but that's what I seek of you, Madam President. I've had so much fear in pronouncing this word, because my grandmother always told me, she said, "Never draw the devil on the wall at night because if you do so, the devil might come into your home." I trust the justice that you will be delivering. I know you've understood me. And that's why I say, after eight months of debate, eight months of lacking respect, and after that, I'm asking you, I'm requesting you, no one else, to acquit Gacumbitsi. I am not disposing of anything. If it were ever to be the case, please act in such a manner that Ms. Mbattang is not disappointed. She stands for the reconciliation of the people in Rwanda, the reconciliation of people that will come about through you, through your judgement, we do believe, and that is why we say -- and that's why you say all the time, "Introduce yourselves, parties. Make your appearances." The acquittal lies with you. Contrary to the Prosecutor, I have produced objective grounds, and I'm requesting you to acquit. If conviction has to occur, well, convict. The Prosecutor just says, "Convict," but he doesn't produce any limit to warrant conviction. That's the difference between us. Now, you have that hammer that stands there -- that gavel, sorry, that stands there. Gacumbitsi's Defence team is convinced that that scale will weigh necessarily on the side of the truth, where reality lies, where there hasn't been any twists and turns, where no witness spent more than three days in Arusha, where witnesses were not met in May or June to be heard later on in October. Madam President, we are even told that we did not summon someone who had to come here and say what the Accused might have done. We have brought witnesses here who told us that they really experienced these events. They didn't try to fabricate or to build anything around this. We know nothing further than that. When I shall have finished, I must confess that in light of what happened in Rwanda, I was still a novice, but what I obtained I brought before this Chamber with all humility. Madam, Your Honours, we would be grateful to you. We need to conclude now. The greatest pleasure for a counsel is not to talk at length but to see his client acquitted, but since you won't order such an acquittal from the Court, our hope is that he will be acquitted, and we will know which date, the date on when we will come and look for Gacumbitsi. It will apply to everyone. We will be ready to comply with your ruling because it will be the ruling of wisdom. We respect you, Madam President, and that is the wish of the entire team, and I would have come to an end. Thank you for your understanding. Thank you for your indulgence. I know it has not been easy, but with Mr. Kouengoua, I haven't done anything wilfully. I only sought to represent my client, and that's all I did. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAREGYESA:</speaker>
            <p>The first, Your Honours, concerns the form of the indictment which learned counsel spent about an hour submitting on, and all I wish to clarify is that the Defence filed a Rule 72 motion challenging defects in the form of the indictment, which motion was denied by Trial Chamber III on 25th July 2002. And the operative paragraph is paragraph 22 of this decision, and I'll just read one sentence, and I quote: "In the opinion of the Chamber, the indictment sets out the material facts of the Prosecution case with enough detail to inform the Accused of the charges against him so that he may prepare his Defence." This therefore is not the appropriate forum to relitigate an issue that has been disposed of. To do so, the Chamber would be sitting in appellate judgement over its own decision. I'll move to the second bullet point, a clarification arising from Counsel Kouengoua's submission with regard to Witnesses TAQ, TAO and TAX. And what I seek to clarify, and which Your Lordships will find on the record, is that these three witnesses were at different places at Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April 1994 when Gacumbitsi arrived. TAQ and TAO were on either side of the church in the compound when Gacumbitsi arrived. On the other hand, TAX was in the convent or nun's compound behind the church, and she only saw Gacumbitsi after the initial gunshots, when Gacumbitsi entered the nun's compound. Three: Counsel said that the Prosecutor hadn't shown motive. We submit, Your Honours, that motive in criminal law is irrelevant. It's not an element of any of the crimes with which the Accused is charged. And it's distinct from the criminal intent or the mens rea, as we know it. Finally, Your Honours, counsel touched on the criminal responsibility of the Accused. It's sufficiently discussed in the closing brief, and all I need to add is that the Prosecutor submits that Gacumbitsi is individually criminally responsible under Article 6 <stage>(1).</stage> I'm now addressing the counts of murder and rape as crimes against humanity. We submit that his responsibility is as a co-perpetrator, for committing these crimes in execution of a common purpose, particularly if the murders and rapes were a foreseeable consequence of this common criminal plan. Now, I'll refer you to paragraph 25 of our indictment. It sufficiently pleads that the Accused acted in concert with others in execution of a common scheme to exterminate the Tutsi -- I paraphrased the paragraph but you have the indictment; it's attached to our closing brief. Now, in that regard, we would submit, Your Honours, that the murders and rapes with which he's charged were not only the foreseeable, but were actually the intended, result of this common purpose for which we now hold him liable. Finally, Your Honours, the wording of that paragraph is in conformity with the ICTY Appeals Chamber decision in the Simic case. Unfortunately, I do not have the appropriate citation with me but will avail it to the registry. And with that, Your Honours, we maintain our earlier submission that the Accused be found guilty and convicted as charged. Most obliged. </p>

            <p>If you could just clarify one point for me, dealing with the three witnesses at the parish, the point being made was that they had not seen each other; therefore, the inference is that they were not there. Is that -- have I understood the argument correctly, the Defence argument? </p>

            <p>Well, you see, Your Honours, that -- Your Honours, that submission is gratuitous. It's unsupported by evidence on the record. First of all, we don't know whether they knew each other in the first place. Counsel did not cross-examine them on this theory he's now advancing. So he cannot raise it ex post facto in his submissions because these submissions we are making arise from what is on the record and how the law applies to that evidence.</p>

            <p>Yes, you want to add something, Mr. Kouengoua? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. I am being compelled to stand. Madam President, I didn't ask the Court to reconsider under 62, 6 -- sorry, 72, sorry. I said right from November 2001, we drew the attention of the Prosecutor and the Court to the indictment. Well, we were not followed. Maybe what the Prosecutor is not saying, there's a version in English -- I don't have it in French. The rebuttal was that Rule 50 allows only the Prosecutor and that I didn't have any right as Defence counsel to raise it. Sorry, Rule 50. That was Rule 50. And I remember Judge Ostrovsky saying this in the course of the hearing. That's the first one. The second, on the 6th of June, the Prosecutor said that my motion was belated, I did not comply with Rule 72. And, Prosecutor, you do agree with me that I was -- it was because of my case that in 2003, 72 was harmonised; I mean the English and the French versions of that Rule. Because previously the French version said, "Until the trial on merits." Whereas the English version stated "30 days". Judge Williams' attention was drawn to this matter in our Court. So, Madam President, to say that this indictment sets out those facts, I don't know where the Prosecutor picks that one from. I have case law here which says that even facts that have been set out in an indictment, in a manner that is inaccurate, would vitiate the said indictment. In fact, Ms. Mbattang cited the judgement of 23 October 2001. Now there's reference made to TAX, TAO and TAQ were in different locations. I'm hearing this for the first time, Madam President. Why? Well, because on the 14th, there was a crowd. I said so. On the 15th, there was a crowd. Sixteenth and 17th, TAO says there were 30 survivors and someone else said 18 survivors, and all of them talk about the classrooms. Another matter, Mr. Prosecutor, another reason why we cannot ask for the conviction of Gacumbitsi is, well, the refugees who came from Rukira and Birenga all went to the parish in order to ensure that their physical integrity were protected. They were hiding themselves. So, Mr. Prosecutor, how do you explain the fact that people who wanted to go into hiding see the killers arrive, then they find them in front of the classrooms? I mean, even in human terms, how can that be envisaged? How can that be considered? And they alleged that when Gacumbitsi came, they started shooting. So they might have shot Gacumbitsi after killing those thousands, as you say, and they have only 15 people. But, at any rate, they could have seen each other. They did not see each other. I don't want to waste the time of the Court. Madam Prosecutor <stage>(sic),</stage> there is a witness who didn't testify, whom you summoned here, CGB, and a convict. It is serious enough, Madam President, this man was introduced as a bodyguard, and on the 16th he said that he was in the Musaza secteur. He also spent a month here, Mr. Prosecutor, and you didn't think he needed to appear here, because he was contradicting all four other ex-convicts, because there were five of them in number. So please provide some other evidence to allow for the conviction of Gacumbitsi. It is becoming now a redundant matter. Now, as for criminal responsibility, individual criminal responsibility, I believe the Rules of Procedure and Evidence which governs your proceedings -- well, when you want to talk about co-perpetrators, they would really talk about conspiracy with a view to committing, et cetera. They usually refer to conspiracy. And it is quite clear, it is specific. It doesn't go through complicity, does it? The paragraph referred to by the Prosecutor in order to justify the stand he has taken, Madam President, I thought we weren't supposed to revisit this. It was supposed to be paragraph 25. It says, "As an authority, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, acting in authority with others, Bagilishema et al, and others," when nothing -- even the subordinates, even the communal policemen would need to be individually identified and be seen as co-perpetrators. The Prosecutor just said, "and others." It could be me, it could be Unobyono <stage>(phonetic),</stage> it could be anyone else. It's not clear at all, as required under Rule 47. Madam President, Prosecutor does not want this trial to come to an end, and he is saying he doesn't have time. The fact is, in your indictment you said that Gacumbitsi conspired with the interim government, and even the Cyangugu trial, you even said that the interim government was set up on the 8th of April, whereas on the 8th of April -- and I asked you on several occasions who of the interim government came to Rusumo before or after April. The conspiracy you are citing, it was with whom? It stands where? And you fail to explain that conspiracy. Your desire to have Gacumbitsi convicted is not enough. This Chamber needs evidence beyond any reasonable doubt, Mr. Prosecutor. This is what we await. You may even speak over and over and over again. As long as that evidence is not adduced, nothing will happen. I am paying attention, but that's not the point. Thank you, Madam President. </p>

            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you for this opportunity you are providing me to enable me to say a word in regard to my trial. I don't have much to say here. A lot of things have already been said and repeated in the course of the closing arguments. Before becoming a bourgmestre, Mr. Gacumbitsi was a teacher. I told you that when I was a teacher, I had not wanted to be a politician. But when the president of the republic says to you, "I want you to make yourself available to the government," you cannot do otherwise. So immediately after my appointment as bourgmestre, I did not fold my arms. I did all within my power to develop the commune in continuation like development projects, associations, cooperative societies. I was involved in all those activities and often I used this period -- I took advantage of this period of solidarity and the peace that reigned to promote the development of the people, and I was commended for that. And this could be seen in my CV. What I did within my commune was to bring all the people in the commune, the Rusumo commune, together, as well as those from the other communes in the various préfectures of the country, those who came to look for land on which they could set up their farms in our commune. And I transformed them into one population. They were like brothers and sisters. I never engaged or pursued a policy of ethnic discrimination or regional discrimination. This was well known. And that is the reason why I stayed in office for all the years which are known to you. However, the war which occurred was a problem. Another problem that occurred was that of the political parties that were set up in 1991. With the advent of multiparty politics, the powers of the bourgmestre declined significantly in view of the fact that there were opposition parties, and you know at the time the bourgmestre could not be chairman of any party whatsoever. He had no duties to perform in a political party. He was the bourgmestre of the commune and he was responsible for matters of security. And so in 1994 there was security, there was peace, but then the situation changed sometime later on. Right from the beginning of the war, there was security within the Rusumo commune. But then, subsequently, the members of the population of other communes who were being persecuted came and sought refuge at Nyabitare parish, and they included Hutus and Tutsis, and this is known. They came from various communes of the Kibungo préfecture, and that's the reason why the refugees who came from the Byumba prefecture -- that's where the war had been raging right from 1990. They came because they were running away from the fighting. They sought refuge in Rusumo commune in April 1994, mainly because there was security there. And that's why, when RPF got to Kibungo and after the massacres that were perpetrated by RPF in that préfecture, those who came from the east sought refuge in Rusumo. And by the way, the préfet of the Rusumo préfecture, who was new, was called Kabanda. And the parliamentarians from Byumba got to Rusumo in April 1994 because that was the only place where security was guaranteed in the Kibungo préfecture, an area that shared the same borders with Tanzania. So where did the problem come from? Among the members of the population who sought refuge in the Rusumo commune, they started burning houses at about the 10th, 11th and 12th of April. I arrested those individuals. Madam President, Your Honours, I arrested those individuals. And my sole concern was to restore security. I kept them in custody, in detention. They were not happy, and so their accomplices set up a group in order to fight the communal administration and the administration of the sub-préfecture. That group even wanted to kill the bourgmestre. And by the way, the préfet was the target of that group because the group did not trust the préfet. So why was I persecuted? I was badly treated and I was in a bad situation because I had thought -- because I was perceived as someone assisting the Tutsis and locking up the criminals. And among those persons, there were Hutus and Tutsis. So I was treated as an accomplice of the RPF. Moreover, it was said that I was a Tutsi, that I had hidden my identity. Their goal was my physical elimination. Following that demonstration, the sous-préfet and the assistant bourgmestre of the commune, having seen that the commune was overwhelmed because of that situation, the prisoners were released but with the intention of bringing back -- bringing them back to prison after security must have been restored. That was on the 13th of April. Since I was the target, I went to see those who had found refuge in my house at Nyakarambi. I told them, "Listen, look for other ways of saving your lives because I've been threatened by an extremist group here in Rusumo." I added that in the group there were people who had come from Kibungo, people sent by a certain Cyasa. That -- well, rather, those people followed my advice and they found refuge in Tanzania. Moreover, they are alive, except the woman called Regine, who was killed by the group of bandits in Nyakarambi. So, Madam President, what didn't I do in the meantime? </p>

            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I'm saying all of this because I was persecuted. I am indeed saddened. In Nyarubuye, people had found refuge there. I told them there was a group of bandits, criminals, who had come from various communes and who had come to Nyarubuye to cause killings. It was not the people of Rusumo who carried out the killings. You can even investigate that, and you would realise that what I'm saying is the truth. Gacumbitsi was not there. I feared to be eliminated at any time. I therefore went into hiding. I became aware of the massacres in Nyarubuye a day after they occurred because there is some distance between Nyarubuye and the place where I was hiding. Madam President, Your Honours, what is being said in my case makes me lose my mind. I know that only God knows what I did. And what I did is known by everyone. Madam President, being tried before your Chamber, I think, I hope, I believe, that justice will take its course, justice that is fair. I, Gacumbitsi, even in my commune -- even in my commune -- I have never hurt anyone. When I punish someone, it was for the purpose of making that person amend his ways. I used or applied punishment that was in continence with security and peace. Everyone who knows me in Rwanda can attest to that. My wife and children knows that I am even incapable of killing a chicken. So when I am described as a criminal, indeed, that saddens me. I do not want to say much because if I have to say all that I know, I will take a lot of your time. I request you, Madam, that in your capacity as President, you should see what you can do to see to it that national reconciliation takes place. Also, do what you can to ensure that the people of Rwanda know what I did. I love Rwanda. I love my country. I thank you, Madam President. I thank you, Your Honours, for your patience. I thank you for having given me the opportunity to address the Court for these few minutes. I thank you. </p>

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Andrésia Vaz, presiding, Judge Jai Ram Reddy, and Judge Sergey Egorov, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 17th June 2004, for the delivery of the judgement in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, Case No. ICTR-2001-64-T.

            <p>We thank you, registrar.Trial Chamber III, composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, Judge Reddy, and Judge Sergey A. Egorov, today renders its judgement in the case against Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. The Chamber shall now read the summary of the judgement, which shall be interpreted into English and Kinyarwanda. Immediately after this hearing, the judgement shall be served on the parties and then made available to the public in its written French version. An English translation shall be made available as soon as possible. Unlike the judgement's integral text, this summary is not authentic. This judgement comprises five chapters. The first is the general introduction, the second deals with the assessment of the evidence and factual findings, the third deals with the legal findings, while the fourth contains the verdict. In chapter 5, the Chamber issues subsequent orders.The Accused, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, was born in 1943 in Kigina secteur, Rusumo commune, Kibungo préfecture. He worked successively as a teacher in Kibungo préfecture, chairman of the Banque populaire de Rusumo, and between 1983 and April 1994 as bourgmestre of Rusumo commune.The indictment: The indictment was confirmed on 2001, and it alleges that the Accused is responsible for genocide and, alternatively, for complicity in genocide on Counts 1 and 2; for crimes against humanity on Count 3, extermination; Count 4, murder; and Count 5, rape.On 20 June 2001, the Tanzanian authorities arrested the Accused and transferred him the same day to the Tribunal's detention facility where he is still in detention. On 26th June, 2001, the Accused pleaded not guilty to each of the counts in the indictment.Mr. Richard Karegyesa, Mrs. Andra Mobberley, and Mr. Khalid Ramadan represented the Prosecutor, while Mr. Kouengoua and Mrs. Anne Ngatio Mbattang represented the defendant. During the trial, that commenced on the 28th of July, 2003, the Chamber granted the Prosecutor's motion to admit into evidence the statement of expert witness Alison Des Forges in Akayesu. The expert witness subsequently appeared to be cross-examined by the Defence. In its decision of the 2nd of October, 2003, dismissing a Defence motion for partial acquittal of the Accused, the Chamber did not take into account some allegations of rape made by a Prosecution witness that had not been disclosed earlier in order to safeguard the basic rights of the Accused.The Prosecution closed its case on the 27th of August, 2003, and the Defence closed its case on the 25th of November, 2003. The Prosecution and the Defence presented their closing arguments on the 1st of March, 2004, on which date the hearing was declared closed and deliberations commenced.Regarding the specific allegations made against the Accused, the Chamber found, on the basis of the testimonies of many credible Prosecution witnesses, that between the 7th and 14th of April, the Accused participated in many meetings in Kibungo préfecture and in his own commune, subdivisions, and secteurs.On 9 April 1994, the Accused instructed conseillers to hold meetings, without the knowledge of the Tutsi, to incite Hutu to massacre the accomplices of the Inkotanyi.On the 7th of April, 1994, he met with various local officials, the Interahamwe, including Cyasa, one of their leaders, and gendarmes. Accompanied by the communal police, the Accused drove around in a communal vehicle.On the 10th of April, 1994, the Accused was delivered boxes of weapons which he either distributed or had distributed in the secteur of the commune at the Kibungo military camp in the presence of Colonel Rwagafirita. The Accused publicly incited the population to attack Tutsi at the Nyakarambi market square on the 13th of April, at Rwanteru, Kanyinya, and Gisenyi trade centres on the 14th of April. He urged a Gisenyi local official not to allow people to cross the River Akagera to seek refuge in Tanzania.The Chamber found that on the 15th of April, 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi participated in an attack on the Nyarubuye parish, Rusumo, where many Tutsi refugees and Hutu refugees had gathered. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrived at the parish in a convoy of many vehicles carrying communal police and Interahamwe who were armed with machetes and other traditional or crafted weapons, guns, and grenades that they used in the attack against the refugees in the Nyarubuye parish. However, based on the evidence adduced, the Chamber could not find that the machetes used by the assailants had been supplied earlier by Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, as alleged in the indictment.Shortly after arriving at the parish at about 3 p.m. and realising that Murefu, a Tutsi refugee, was moving towards him with confidence, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi killed him, thus signalling the beginning of the massacres. He spoke to the crowd through a megaphone and instructed Hutu refugees to separate themselves from Tutsi. When some complied with the instructions, the communal police and Interahamwe attacked the refugees in the church building. The Chamber found that members of the communal police attacked the parish on the instructions of the Accused. The Accused directed the attacks and gave instructions which the assailants understood as an incitement or encouragement to act.The Chamber also found that the following day, 16 April 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrived at the Nyarubuye church building, accompanied by a man named Rubanguka, a judge at the Rusumo court, and a group of assailants. Some assailants were armed with spears, machetes, and bows and arrows. It is not established that the Accused himself was armed. In the presence of the Accused, Rubanguka planted a spear into a body, but it was not established if it was that of a corpse or somebody who was live. The Chamber found that the Accused also directed the attack of the 16th of April, as he did with the attack of the previous day.During the attack of the 16th of April, the assailants, including Judge Rubanguka, finished off survivors before proceeding to loot the parish building. </p>

            <p>The Chamber, found on the basis of all the evidence adduced, that between the 15th and the 17th of April, 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi led attacks against Tutsi civilian refugees who had gathered at the Nyarubuye parish and personally took part in the attacks.On the 15th of April, 1994, he killed a Tutsi called Murefu. On the 15th, 16th, and 17th of April, he led attacks by giving clear instructions to the assailants to attack Tutsi who had sought refuge in the parish. Among the assailants of the 15th of April, 1994 were the Interahamwe, gendarmes, and communal police.The Chamber considers that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi facilitated the transport of the communal police, Interahamwe, and weapons to the Nyarubuye parish by authorising or facilitating the use of commune vehicles. He led attacks against Tutsi civilians by giving an example or by instructing the assailants to kill the refugees.The Chamber considers that it is established that thousands of Hutu and Tutsi civilians had sought refuge at the parish in the days preceding the attack of the 15th of April, 1994, and that on that same day, Hutu were separated from Tutsi who were attacked. Very many Tutsi were killed that day. Survivors were finished off the following day and two days later. A few weeks later, the premises of the parish was still littered with many corpses. Thus, the Chamber found that a large number of Tutsi who found refuge at Nyarubuye parish were killed there between the 15th and 17th of April, 1994.In his pre-trial brief, the Prosecutor mentioned the murder on the 14th of April, 1994 in the residence or near the residence of the Accused of a Tutsi man named Kanyogote who was accompanied by his three children. The Prosecutor presented two testimonies in support of this allegation. The Chamber can only find that these allegations were not included in the indictment.In this case, it is indeed the substance of the indictment that is affected by the inclusion of a criminal act of murder that was not contained in the indictment or by the amendments of the particulars of identification of the victims of the said murder. Consequently, the Chamber has decided to disregard the evidence adduced by the Prosecutor regarding the acts of the Accused in relation to the alleged murder of Kanyogote and his children and has refrained from making a finding in this regard. However, the Chamber found that Kanyogote and his children, who were Tutsi, who felt threatened because of their ethnicity, were killed in April 1994 in Rusumo commune.Regarding the allegations relating to the murder of two Tutsi refugees at the Nyabitare Catholic centre on the 15th of April, 1994, as set out in paragraph 34 of the indictment, the Chamber was not convinced by Witness TAC's testimony in support of this double allegation of murder. The Chamber found that several factors negated its credibility and reliability. Witness TAC witnessed the incident, recounted only for a short time while crawling on his stomach hidden in a banana field at a distance of about 30 metres from the incident. Considering the situation, coupled with the serious threats in which the witness found himself at the time of the events, his identification of the Accused at the scene and his narration of events and gestures, the Chamber assessed his account of events with caution. Moreover, the Chamber noted the existence of several inconsistencies and contradictions in Witness TAC's statements. Regarding paragraph 36 of the indictment, the Chamber found that on the 13th of April, 1994 at Nyakarambi, the Accused expelled his tenants, Marie and Béatrice, Tutsi women, knowing that by so doing he was exposing them to external dangers and the imminent risk of being targeted by assailants. Marie and Béatrice were killed in the night of the 13th of April, 1994. However, hearsay evidence is insufficient, failing corroboration, to establish that the Accused ordered the specific murder of Marie and Béatrice, and considering the circumstances under which Witness TAS obtained this information, her evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused gave the order.Regarding the allegations of rape contained in the indictment, and on the basis of all the evidence adduced, the Chamber found that the Accused publicly incited on the 17th of April, 1994 the rape of Tutsi girls by specifying that sticks should be stuck into their genitals in the event they resisted. The Chamber considered as established, beyond a reasonable doubt, the rapes and other acts of sexual violence committed against and recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ and found that such acts were consequences of the instigation made by the Accused against Tutsi women and girls.In Rusumo commune, acts of sexual violence were part of a systematic and widespread attack against the Tutsi civilian population during the events of April 1994. Even if it is possible that many rapes were committed in Rusumo commune in the period referred to in the indictment, only a few cases of rape and acts of sexual violence were referred to the Chamber, which did not enable it to make a finding on their widespread character. The Chamber found that the rapes recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ, TAO, TAS, and TAP are established. However, with the exception of the rape of Witness TAS, the Chamber did not find that these acts were the direct consequences of the instigation by the Accused to rape Tutsi women.Furthermore, the Chamber found that the Prosecutor has established beyond a reasonable doubt that from April to June 1994, in Rusumo commune in Rwanda, there were rapes and other acts of sexual violence which were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Tutsi civilian population.The Chamber is of the opinion that the bourgmestre had legal authority over the communal police, including the communal brigadiers. He occupied a position of superior vis-à-vis the said communal personnel. Moreover, he was specifically responsible for the maintenance of law and order in the commune. However, the Chamber cannot find, in the light of the evidence before it, that the Accused had superior authority over the conseiller of the secteur, gendarmes, soldiers, and the Interahamwe that were in his commune at the time of the events under consideration. The law did not per se place him in such a position. Although his responsibilities regarding the maintenance of law and order afforded him the power to take legal measures in that respect, which would be binding on everyone in the commune, the Prosecutor did not adduce any evidence that such power placed him ipso facto in a position of superior, vis-à-vis, each of the category of persons mentioned above.After having made its factual findings, the Trial Chamber will now focus on their legal characterisation and on the assessment of any responsibility the Accused may have incurred.With regard to genocide, the Prosecution must prove that the Accused had the specific intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnical, racial or religious group, and that he committed any one of the acts, any one of the five acts enumerated in Article 2 <stage>(2)</stage> of the Statute. In the case at bar, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is charged with seeking to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group by killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm.The Chamber found that during the period referred to in the indictment, Rwandan citizens were individually identified according to the following ethnic groups: Tutsi, Hutu and Twa. In its findings, in its factual findings, the Chamber largely referred to the utterances and actions of the Accused through which he manifested his genocidal intent. Thus, on the 9 April meeting, he exhorted the conseillers de secteur to instigate the Hutus to kill the Tutsi. He made similar utterances to the population on the morning of 13th April at the Nyakarambi market and on 14 April at Rwanteru and Kanyinya commercial centres.On 17 April, the Accused instigated the rape of Tutsi women and girls. Moreover, he personally killed Murefu, a Tutsi. The Chamber finds that at the time when the events occurred in Rusumo commune, which events have been established in the factual findings above, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi had the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.The Chamber thus found that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi participated in the killing of Tutsis at Nyarubuye parish, that he personally killed a Tutsi, Murefu, and that he caused serious bodily harm to Tutsi women who were raped at his instigation, all of which bear his requisite genocidal intent.In the light of the foregoing, and with respect to Count 1, that is genocide, the Chamber finds that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is liable under Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute for planning, instigating, ordering communal police, committing and aiding and abetting the killing of and perpetration of serious bodily harm on members of the Tutsi group as part of the crime of genocide.Hence, and on account of the similarity of the acts in question, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to consider whether he is also liable under Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> of the Statute.Accordingly, the Chamber finds Sylvestre Gacumbitsi guilty of genocide pursuant to Article 2 <stage>(3)</stage>
              <stage>(a)</stage> and <stage>(b)</stage> of the Statute as charged in Count 1 of the indictment.Count 2, that is complicity in genocide, is an alternative count to Count 1, genocide. Moreover, it is based on the same factual allegations contained in the indictment as Count 1. Since the Accused has already been found guilty of genocide as charged in Count 1, pursuant to Article 2 <stage>(3)</stage>
              <stage>(a)</stage> and <stage>(b)</stage> of the Statute, the Chamber did not consider the count of complicity in genocide provided for in Article 2 <stage>(3).</stage> This count is therefore dismissed.Crimes against humanity: With regard to crimes against humanity, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi is charged with extermination, murder, and rape. Before assessing the facts established with respect to each of the three crimes, the Chamber first inquired whether the general constituent element of this category of crimes, that is, crimes again humanity, were established. On that basis, the Chamber found that a widespread and systematic attack on a civilian population took place in the territory of Rusumo commune in April 1994, and that the Accused -- and that the instructions given by the Accused to the assailants contain an ethnic-based discriminatory factor which prevailed during the attacks and in the choice of victims.Count 3 of the indictment charges the Accused with extermination as a crime against humanity pursuant to Article 3 <stage>(b)</stage> of the Statute. The Chamber held, on the basis of its factual conclusion supra, that the high numerical strength of the victims of the Nyarubuye parish massacre supports a finding of widespread killing. The Chamber noted that witness accounts show that it was a large-scale massacre that resulted in numerous deaths, a fact that is corroborated by the testimony of Mr. Patrick Fergal Keane, a BBC journalist, who, some weeks later, saw and filmed numerous corpses in the parish compound.The Chamber found that the Accused knew of existence of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population in Rusumo in April 1994, because at local level, he planned and led certain operations.On the days preceding the attack on Nyarubuye, the Accused participated in preparatory meetings with officials of the gendarmerie and Interahamwe with a view to launching a massive attack against the Tutsi, incited conseillers, local political officials, to kill the Tutsi, to single them out and kill them, distributed boxes of weapons in different locations, and travelled within the commune to ensure that his instructions had produced the desired effect.The Chamber, in conclusion, stated that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused incurred individual criminal responsibility under Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute for planning extermination, instigating extermination, ordering the communal police to exterminate, and aiding and abetting the extermination of members of the Tutsi ethnic group in Rusumo commune in April 1994. Furthermore, the Chamber deemed it unnecessary to consider whether the Accused is equally liable under Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> of the Statute, given the similarity of the events in question. Accordingly, with regard to Count 3, the Chamber finds the Accused guilty of extermination as a crime against humanity.Count 4 of the indictment charges the Accused with murder as a crime against humanity pursuant to Article 3 <stage>(a)</stage> of the Statute. The Prosecutor's factual allegations in support of this charge are contained in paragraphs 31 to 36 of the indictment. The Chamber considered that the Prosecution has not established beyond reasonable doubt the allegations of murder. Consequently, the Chamber finds the Accused not guilty under Count 4, namely, murder as a crime against humanity.In the opinion of Chamber, the penetration of the victim's sexual organ by the sexual organ of the assailant or the insertion by the assailant of any object into the victim's sex organs amounts to rape, although -- although, those are not the only instances of conduct that constitute rape within the meaning of Article 3 <stage>(g)</stage> of the Statute. The Chamber has already held that Prosecution Witness TAQ was raped at the same time as seven other Tutsi women and girls on an account of the fact that the assailants inserted their sex organs or a stick into the genitals of each of the victims; that similarly, the wife of Prosecution Witness TAO was raped on the ground, that the assailant inserted his sex organ into that of the victim; that Witness TAS was raped in the same manner, as well as TAP and her mother. All these acts that have been recounted before this Chamber are covered by this definition.The Chamber reiterates its earlier findings concerning the existence of a widespread and systematic attack on a civilian population in Rusumo in April 1994. The Accused had knowledge of such a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population because he was one of those who masterminded it and because he planned, ordered, and led the attack at certain times and in certain locations.In its factual conclusions, in its factual findings, the Chamber held that the widespread and systematic attack targeted specifically a civilian population, notably the Tutsi, and also that Prosecution Witnesses DAQ, TAP, and TAS, including the wife of Prosecution Witness TAO, the mother of Prosecution Witness TAP, and seven Tutsi women and girls, were all raped as recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ. The evidence shows that all these victims are civilians. The Chamber is of the opinion that these rape victims were chosen because of their Tutsi ethnic origin or because of their relationship with a person of a Tutsi ethnic group, which is the case of Prosecution Witness TAS. The Chamber therefore found that the discriminatory factor guided the attacks and the choice of rape victims.In the circumstances of the present case, the utterances made by the Accused to the effect that in case of resistance the victims should be killed in an atrocious manner, and the fact that the rape victims were attacked by the very assailants they were fleeing from, sufficiently established that they did not consent to the sexual acts of which they were victims. </p>

            <p>The Chamber considered that the evidence adduced shows that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi certainly instigated the rape of Tutsi women and girls on the basis of his utterances, such as were heard by Prosecution Witness TAQ. For his part, Prosecution Witness TAS also testified to having heard those who raped her, saying that the Accused had ordered them to rape Tutsi women and girls.The Chamber recalls that immediately after the Accused made utterances instigating the rape of women and girls, Tutsi women and girls, while he was in a convoy crossing the bridge between Kanbobwa and Nyarubuye in the direction of Nyarubuye, Prosecution Witness TAQ and seven other Tutsi women and girls were raped by young men, who, being in the vicinity, heard the bourgmestre's instigation. The Chamber therefore finds that the rapes recounted by Prosecution Witness TAQ indeed resulted from the instigation of the Accused. However, the Chamber finds no evidence of a nexus between the rape of Prosecution Witness TAS and the possible utterances of the Accused, and cannot therefore find the Accused liable for rape on that score. The same applies to the rape of the wife of Prosecution Witness TAO and the rape of the mother of Prosecution Witness TAP. The Chamber, nevertheless, considers that these rapes have been established and are part of the widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population in Rusumo.The Chamber therefore finds Sylvestre Gacumbitsi criminally liable pursuant to Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute for instigating the rape of TAQ and seven other Tutsi women and girls, thereby committing a crime against humanity. Consequently, the Chamber does not deem it necessary to enquire whether he's also liable under Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> of the Statute, given the similarity of the facts and the absence of any evidence of a superior-subordinate relationship between the Accused and the perpetrators of the rape. Thus, with regard to Count 5, the Chamber finds Sylvestre Gacumbitsi guilty of rape as a crime against humanity.Now, we will call on the Accused, Mr. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, to move closer to the Bench because we are now going to hand down the verdict.Please stand up. Thank you.On these grounds and considering all the facts in the case file, Trial Chamber III unanimously finds the Accused guilty of genocide, Count 1; crime against humanity, extermination, Count 3; crime against humanity, rape, Count 5. The Trial Chamber unanimously finds the Accused not guilty of crime against humanity, murder, Count 4. Lastly, unanimously, the Trial Chamber, given the guilty verdict in regard to the count of genocide, dismisses Count 2, that is, the count of complicity in genocide.Chapter 5 of the judgement contains the arguments of the parties regarding mitigating and aggravating circumstances, as well as the consequential orders following the verdict. With regard to aggravating circumstances, the Trial Chamber first of all noted that under Article 23 <stage>(2)</stage> of the Statute, the gravity or seriousness of the crimes committed must be taken into account during the determination of the sentence. It follows that the more heinous a crime is, the heavier the sentence should be. However, in assessing the seriousness of the crimes of which the Accused has been found guilty, the Trial Chamber also took into account the special circumstances of the case, as well as the form and extent of the Accused's participation in the commission of the crimes. The Trial Chamber is of the opinion that the status of the Accused in April 1994 as bourgmestre, and the most influential as well as most important person in Rusumo commune, amounts to an aggravating circumstance to the extent that the Accused participated in the crimes committed, and that he was among the leaders by planning the crimes by inciting their commission and sometimes by leading the assailants to the sites of the massacres. By so doing, the Accused abused the confidence placed in him by those under his authority. His active participation in these criminal events explains why he was not able to take measures to prevent them or to punish the perpetrators thereof when he could.The seriousness of the crimes committed, in particular, genocide, but also atrocious rapes that some victims suffered, are also aggravating circumstances.Under aggravating -- or, rather, mitigating circumstances, the Trial Chamber took into account the work done by the Accused as a bourgmestre as well as his general conduct before April 1994. These mitigating circumstances are witnessed or reflected by defence testimony, but also the testimony of Prosecution witnesses, for example, the testimony of Witness TAW. This witness mentioned the good conduct of the Accused and his good relations with the Tutsi before the death of President Habyarimana. Furthermore, the family of the Accused is still living in Rwanda and enjoys good relations with their neighbours without distinction as to ethnic origin. However, these mitigating circumstances must be counter-balanced against the aggravating circumstances in a determination of the sentence against the Accused.Taking into account the practice followed in our Tribunal as well as in the ICTY, the Trial Chamber notes that a sentence must, first and foremost, be commensurate with the gravity of the offence. Persons found guilty of genocide or of extermination as a crime against humanity, or of these two crimes, receive sentences stretching from 15 years to life imprisonment. Forms of secondary participation or participation as accessories receive lighter sentences.Taking into account the general scale of imprisonment applied by the ad hoc Tribunals and the courts of Rwanda, as well as the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that it should impose an exemplary sentence on Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. The Trial Chamber is of the view that the individual circumstances in the present matter must affect the sentence in such a way that the Trial Chamber will not apply a life sentence against Sylvestre Gacumbitsi.For these reasons and considering the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, ruling unanimously, openly, and in first instance, in accordance with Articles 23, 26, and 27 of the Statute of the Tribunal, and Rules 101, 102, 103, and 104 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence; considering that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was found guilty of genocide, Count 1, crime against humanity, extermination, Count 3, crime against humanity, rape, Count 5; considering the Prosecution's final brief; considering the Defence's final brief; the Prosecutor -- having heard the Prosecution and the Defence; regarding the crimes referred to supra, the Trial Chamber sentences Sylvestre Gacumbitsi to the single sentence of 30 years of imprisonment for all the counts on which he has been found guilty. The Trial Chamber decides that the period of preventive or provisional detention will be deducted from the total period of term of imprisonment, that the sentence will be enforced in a state that will be designated in consultation with the Trial Chamber. Pending the transfer to the place of imprisonment, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will be maintained in custody under the same conditions as have existed so far. The Trial Chamber decides that the present judgement is imminently enforceable. As soon as where there is a Notice of Appeal, the sentence or the enforcement of the sentence will be stayed until the Appeal Chamber makes its determination; however, the convicted person will remain in detention. That is the judgement delivered by this Trial Chamber in Arusha on 17th June 2004.We thank you all. The proceedings stand adjourned. </p>

            <p>Good afternoon, Madam President. Good afternoon to the Prosecution. Good afternoon to the interpreters and staff. Madam President, I am a bit confused, I must say. And please excuse me for the clothing I am wearing. The first Status Conference that I went to was not the same and people were not robed, and I consider that I should dress the same for this Status Conference. My name is Mr. Kouengoua from the Cameroonian Bar, and I am lead counsel for Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. Thank you, Madam President. </p>

            <p>Thank you, very much. The Status Conference is a -- has been called so that Accused can -- Appellant can say if there is any matter that has not been raised, any personal matters, and the brief, as far as I can see, have been all filed and so have the translations.

          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, so that would be the only pending brief, but the Status Conference is mainly not to discuss legal questions which can be raised before the Bench, but to give the Appellant an opportunity to say if there are concerns regarding detention facilities or anything that should be transmitted either to Pre-Appeal Judge or through him to the whole Bench.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. There is, indeed, a problem regarding the brief and reply. The French version, the translation was no doubt transmitted to me counsel for the Appellant, but unfortunately, I only received a copy of that document from the registry just yesterday. At about 7 p.m., the client received that after I found him at the detention facility. So, there are technical issues that I, as lead counsel, I am dealing with. Now, that we've received the translation, I think that on the 1st of March, you issued an order saying that I should file my brief by the 16th. I haven't had an opportunity to read that order and, in fact, just before you came into the room, I was trying to obtain the documents. So, procedurally speaking, one of our main concerns is that we would hope that you would take into account these issues when you give an order regarding time limits, also with regard to the remark you made at the very beginning. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Just one question regarding this first issue; how much time -- extra time would you need? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Not extra time. I think that I would be able to respect the time limit as provided for in the Rules, but you made an order on the 1st, and only yesterday I received the French translation of that as did my client. So, perhaps we can start counting the time limit beginning today, and I shouldn't have any problem filing my brief. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Thank you. Madam President, to go on, the second issue that I as lead counsel for the Appellant has, has to do with my Defence team. I am supposed to have a co-counsel as well as an assistant, but I am alone here in the hearing. These are issues that were -- that we are dealing with, that I am dealing with. I am trying to surmount these difficulties here, and you will remember that my trial was the quickest trial in the history of the ICTR, and we -- before this Court hope to be able to deal with all these difficulties and move just as rapidly, Madam President. These are the issues that we are dealing with right now, as we try to accomplish our duties. </p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>What is the status of your -- what is the status of this request regarding this co-counsel and someone extra on your team with the registry? Have you requested for extra assistance? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. In the appeal cases, we still need a co-counsel, but they are limited in the number of hours that they can work, that is limited to 350. Now, I was also given an assistant for three months. Normally, assistants can work for six months. So the contract for my assistant expired on the 24th of February. He was able to work in December, January and February. Perhaps based on your recommendation, that contract can be renewed so that we will be able to finish the work such as finishing our book of appeals so that the appeal trial can move forward as quickly as possible. This would be my request, Madam President. </p>

            <p>The Status Conference is resumed. So Ms. Aminatta, Appellant has some queries concerning the extension of contract of the assistant, and is it also the appointment of co-counsel or is it the same? Are you calling assistant co-counsel? Is it one or two people? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. In fact, there are two different people, co-counsel is already here, but is limited by the number of hours. As regards the assistant, however, I am requesting an extension of that contract so that the assistant could be with me during the duration of the appeals work, especially as we need to finish that work yesterday, I was at UNDF to meet with the Accused. I had to stop at 3 p.m. to come back to contact the registry, and I had no time to even pay a visit Ms. Aminatta just to say hello, because I am limited in the time I have. So, if I could have someone to help me with the brief as I can work on other task. That would help me enormously. All of these issues need to be taken into account, Madam President. Thank you. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#madam-president">
            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So the issue before us now is the assistant extension of the contract. Ms. Aminatta, have you looked into it?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ms-n-gum">
            <speaker>MS. N'GUM:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. We have not received any request from Mr. Kouengoua, unless I am mistaken, because he is supposed to send the request for the assistant -- appointment of the legal assistant. And to my knowledge, we have not received anything. In fact, we were looking for an application before I came out here, and as at this afternoon, we have not received any application from Mr. Kouengoua. It's not automatic even for co-counsel who was co-counsel at the trial stage, when the matter comes on appeal, the lead counsel has to apply for the co-counsel to be re-assigned on the Appellate matter. And as far as I know, we have not received any request for the lead counsel -- co-counsel contract to be -- to be renewed. The question of the hours, that is the registry's policy that on appeal co-counsel works for 350 hours. The legal assistant can be renewed for the period that is requested by the lead counsel if he puts in a request, but as at this afternoon, Your Lordship, we had not received any request from Mr. Kouengoua, and we will be pleased to deal with the matter as quickly as possible once we receive a request from him, Your Lordship, because he has to justify why he needs a co-counsel and also why he needs a legal assistant. It is not automatic that they continue from the trial stage to the appellate stage. Thank you, Your Lordship. </p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, very much, Ms. Aminatta for the clarification. Mr. Kouengoua, have you applied for an extension of the legal assistant, on the one hand, and for -- and extension of hours of co-counsel? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Madam President. I was not making a complaint earlier. I was simply talking about the difficulties that I am having with my work. Ms. Aminatta said something very important. She said that as soon as I make a request, she would deal with the issue. So, I think the ball is in my court now, and there is no longer need for discussion on this matter. I will make a request as soon as possible, or perhaps I would give a copy of the request I have already made, which may have not made it to her office. I do have problems with my fax, but at any rate, I will get that request into the section as soon as possible. </p>

            <speaker>MADAM PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Perhaps, you can make the request now. We can have it on the record and you do not need to go back to your office to make the request. At least, for the legal assistant, I think it would be quicker if you just said now what is it you require?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Very well, Madam President. As regards the legal assistant, Madam President, I already mentioned my first request in November 2004 that for the appellate hearings, I would need that legal assistant to conduct research into jurisprudence, into legal doctrine and to prepare the various briefs that I need to file. Currently, I still have one last brief to file, which needs to be filed within the time limit prescribed by you. I also have to file the book of appeals as well as the book of authorities. We all know this. On 1st March 2004, I finished my pleadings. And when I left I found out that there was an order, an eviction order in quotes; "I no longer had an office." I have paper documents here, parts were in Cameroon. So, it's not easy to deal with as counsel. This is very important. When we were at trial, I had an office with a telephone and a computer and all of my documents there. And that problem was not raised, but now I have to work between Doulla and Arusha. It's a long way, and if I cannot arrive with an assistant, for example, to conduct all of that research, I, indeed, will have problems. I have all the goodwill in the world. I will work very hard and I have the strength to do so, but I will have to deal with these issues. And if they are not resolved, this may occasion delays in the proceedings. So these are the issues that have to be dealt with. And I, respectfully submit, that the assistant's contract should be extended, and I ask that that assistant be able to come to Arusha to conduct the necessary research. This is very important for us, Madam President. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Madam President, I have thought about that in great detail, but normally an assistant contract should last for six months, and I think that that would be sufficient. Six months would be entirely sufficient for the work, Madam President. As I was saying, it is understood if I finish before that, that's very well, I won't try to renew for another two or three months, if we are given the six months from the beginning. Normally, the contract should last for six months. My assistant was given a three-month contract, and we still have work to do. So, I think six months would be sufficient. </p>

            <p>Thank you, very much, Mr. Kouengoua. So, with respect to the legal assistant, we'll ask Ms. Aminatta to respond to you whether an extension of six months is possible. Regarding co-counsel, I think this is not a matter to be solved here because the registry has directives, and there is a special procedure if you want to appeal, and that is not at the Status Conference. Ms. Aminatta, do you think you can give a response to counsel within a period of time you now can suggest? </p>

So, you have the written request before you now to extend for six months the legal assistant of counsel. So, you have the request before you as from now.

            <p>This is an appeal by both sides in the case of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi against the Prosecutor. The appellant Mr. Gacumbitsi and the Prosecution, both appearing for the judgement rendered on 17th June 2004 by Trial Chamber III composed of Judge Vaz, presiding, and Judges Reddy and Egorov. The Trial Chamber found the appellant, Mr. Gacumbitsi, guilty of genocide, count 1; extermination as a crime against humanity, count 3; and rape as a crime against humanity, count 5; all this being for his participation in crimes committed against the Tutsi population of Kibungo préfecture in April 1994. The Trial Chamber sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 30 years. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's appeal as set out in his notice of appeal filed on 20 July 2004 and in the appellant's brief filed on 4 October 2004 consists of allegations of legal and factual errors on the part of the Trial Chamber. In ground 1 he alleges errors in certain interlocutory decisions of the Trial Chamber, including the dismissal of a motion to postpone, which dismissal had the effect, so he says, of denying the appellant sufficient time and facilities to prepare his defence. He also alleges errors relating to his convictions with genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, and rape as a crime against humanity. He submits that his sentence should be reduced to 15 years in the event that his convictions are not quashed on appeal. The Prosecution responds that all grounds of appeal raised by the appellant should be dismissed. Now, the Prosecution's appeal comprises six grounds. In its appeal brief filed on 20th September 2004 and its amended notice of appeal filed on 16 December 2004, the Prosecution avers that the Trial Chamber erred in various respects in sentencing in acquitting the appellant of murder as a crime against humanity, in failing to find him criminally responsible for certain rapes, and in its enunciation or elements of rape, also in referring to and refusing consider joint criminal enterprise as a mode of liability, because it had not been pleaded adequately in the indictment, and in failing to conclude that the appellant had authority -- or had authority to order the conseillers, Interahamwe, gendarmes, and other participants in the attack in Rusumo commune. The appellant objects to all grounds of appeal raised by the Prosecution, except ground 4, elements of rape, with respect to which he does not take a position. During the hearing counsel may argue the grounds of appeal in the order they consider most suitable for their presentation, as long as they indicate which grounds they are arguing and provided that they adhere to the time periods stipulated in the scheduling order issued on 8 December 2005. They may not enlarge their pleaded grounds of appeal. This hearing will proceed according to that scheduling order. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will present his submissions this afternoon until 4:15 p.m. Following a 30-minute pause, the Prosecution will then begin to present its response from 4:45 to 6 p.m. and will continue its presentation tomorrow morning from 9 to 9:45 a.m. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will then have 30 minutes for the reply from 9:45 to 10:15 a.m., and thereafter, if he wishes, he may present a personal address limited to ten minutes. The hearing of the appeal of Mr. Gacumbitsi will conclude 10:25 a.m. tomorrow. The Prosecution will have until 1 p.m. to make its submissions. After a pause, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi will have an opportunity to respond from 3 to 5 p.m. The Prosecution will reply from 5:30 to 6 p.m. The Judges may interrupt the parties at any time to ask questions or they may ask questions following each party's submissions. I would like now to invite counsel for Mr. Gacumbitsi to present submissions in support of his appeal. Ready, Counsel? </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I am much obliged, Mr. President, and Your Honours of the Appeals Chamber. On the 17 of June 2004, Trial Chamber III of the ICTR found Sylvestre Gacumbitsi guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity, extermination and rape. That judgement came about following an indictment initiated by the Prosecutor in June 2001, and it comprised five charges, namely, count 1, genocide; 2, complicity in genocide; third count, extermination; 3, murder -- 4, murder; 5, rape. To carry out an objective appraisal of that judgement, it is important to recall the facts and the proceedings. Mr. President, Your Honours, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi who came from the remote areas of Rusumo -- thank you. I was saying, Mr. President, that Gacumbitsi, having come from the remote areas of equatorial forest in Rusumo, can only produce the facts here, the facts that he believes are true, only the facts. And the law lies with you, and it is for you to apply them to the facts before you. That having been stated, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was born in 1943 in the Rusumo commune, Kigina secteur, Kibungo préfecture. He was a teacher that was highly appreciated by his pupils and members of the population. He was also president of the banque populaire de Rusumo and the bourgmestre of Rusumo from '83 to 1994. On the 6th of April 1994, a plane transporting the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi crashed, and that crash occurred, whereas since the 1st of October 1990, there had been an armed conflict raging in Rwanda. Rusumo commune is on the eastern area of Rwanda at the border with Tanzania, and when the Rwandan Patriotic Front moved into Rwanda, and after their victory over the Rwandan armed forces in 1994, a segment of the population, including the Accused, sought refuge in Congo and in Tanzania so as to avoid being killed. Mr. President, on the 20th of June 2001, following the confirmation of the indictment I referred to earlier, the Prosecutor had Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrested in the Mkugwa refugee camp, which is located in Tanzania. He was transferred on the same day to Arusha and kept in detention at the UNDF, with the UN detention facility. On 26th of June 2001, he pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against him. On the 26th of July 2002 the Trial Chamber rejected a preliminary motion filed by the Defence which referred to the vagueness, vacuousness, and the need for an amendment to the indictment. That was -- that was rejected. Now, with the multiple difficulties encountered by the Defence in preparing its defence of the Accused, on the 22nd of July 2002, it seized Chamber with a motion seeking a postponement of the trial. That application was not entertained, but then the Trial Chamber made the Defence feel that it had duly noted the well-founded difficulties that it had raised. And on the first -- and it said, sorry, that this could be taken up again at the time when it would be submitting its own case, that is, in the course of the status conference. On the 1st of August 2003, that is, after the Trial Chamber had noted the difficulties encountered, the difficulties being faced by the Defence, that same Chamber did reject the application of the Defence because it had received a list of five Prosecution witnesses who were all detainees in Rwanda. The application of the Defence was simple. We said, "Prosecutor, please inform us on the reasons for the release of those who have been brought here so as to enable us to prepare our defence." The Chamber decided as follows: "Prosecutor, if you have the documents on the grounds of which you have brought this person here, could you make them available to the Defence so that you can explain; otherwise, you will explain yourself within 48 hours." Well, the Prosecutor did nothing about it, and when I repeated this fact in the course of the trial, I was blamed. And that is verifiable. It is in the records of the proceedings. On the 28th of August 2003, and based on the purport of the decision made on the 28th of July 2003, the Defence, in view of being told by the Trial Chamber that it could take up this matter again, was told that it had no such -- no such right. Because during the Prosecution's presentation, Defence did not have any opportunity to meet with its team. Again, the Trial Chamber said, "Defence, you are facing a lot of difficulties, but the trial cannot be postponed because the date had already been set since the 10th of July. The Defence submitted to -- at the registry a report by its expert witness. And pursuant to Rule 94 bis of the rules, the Prosecutor had 14 days to indicate, firstly, whether it accepts Pascal Ndengejeho as a witness or does not accept him, whether they accept the expert witness statement or he wishes to cross-examine the expert witness. On the 17th of October 2003, the Prosecutor reacted by indicating that if the Trial Chamber accepted Mr. Ndengejeho as an expert, it was the intention of the Prosecutor to cross-examine the said expert. Well, Your Honours, it was agreed that the trial will come to an end on the 31st of October. But then on the 20th of October, a Judge was unavailable, and our trial was accordingly adjourned. And we all met in the Chambers of the presiding Judge, and in the course of our discussions, a decision was made that the trial will resume on the 17th of November. And it resumed with the hearing of two factual witnesses, followed by expert witness, Professor Lecompte from Paris and Ndengejeho, and finally, with the Accused Gacumbitsi. So we ended and my team goes back to Cameroon, and nothing else could be done. Mr. President, Gacumbitsi, whom I am defending today and whose rights have to be restored by yourselves, enable him to understand what he is being blamed for, because if this matter had been addressed, otherwise, we wouldn't have been here today. I'm in Cameroon with my team. I'm in Cameroon, and the Prosecutor files a motion so that all my investigators can be thrown out, and the Trial Chamber doesn't find out whether we had already received such a motion. Now, they only told us our expert was no longer an expert, his report was dismissed or rejected, and the gentleman who had to come from the Paris would longer be allowed to appear. What you might not know is that when we get to Arusha on the 13th of November and went to see our client in prison, he produces a copy of a decision made by the Court. The criminal Tribunal is an international institution. It is highly respected. If decisions have to be issued in the dark, if these decisions have to be made behind the Accused who has no powers who has no office here, Your Honours, please, ensure that these proceedings are observed. No one today can understand that this kind of thing can happen in 2003. Unfortunately, that's the experience that Gacumbitsi had. We asked that that decision be reviewed or reconsidered. Your Honours, these are words that we hear, and I'm sorry to say so, this is what we hear in those countries they call banana republics. And the Prosecutor was asking that the decision be rendered before the 17th October, that is, before the commencement of trial. And as of today, nobody had told us why we had to resume on the 17th of October just by the fact that we have asked for it. And this is what they call international justice? Mr. Gacumbitsi, who didn't understand anything, didn't know what was happening. And I myself, I must confess, as his counsel, I didn't understand anything. I don't know whether some day I will be asked what kind of prejudice Gacumbitsi has suffered, unless it is considered in some other units which are not ours, but it is serious enough. Gacumbitsi maintained a dignified attitude, and he told his counsel, "Well, Counsel, I've done nothing. Move on. The Prosecutor will find what he seeks. Trial Chamber believes in justice, and it is in that Trial Chamber that I trust and that I wait for justice." These are the errors, interlocutory errors, which prevented us. And if I were in the position of those who came here to tell us what happened, who traumatised us, and this is within a period of four months in 2003. Your Honours, in spite of all these difficulties, we felt, as we were told by the Trial Chamber on the 6th of June 2002, that when it comes to substance, we'll see what will happen; this will be corrected. And we believed them, because if one doesn't believe in justice, there is nothing else to do. We believe in justice. We are before you. We still believe in justice unless we have something to blame ourselves for. And it's my hope that soon we will tell you what kind of fault we have committed. When a trial is adjourned, each and every one has to go home to rest and to greet those who -- or commend you for this trouble that you go through every day. Mr. President, Your Honours, let me now get to the judgement rendered on the 17th of June with respect to the first count, namely, that of genocide. I would like once more to say that errors were made. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>I am on the first ground of my appeal, namely, the errors committed. Thank you. That's okay, Mr. President. I was saying, Your Honours, that errors were committed by Trial Chamber, that is, with respect to the evidence adduced in support of the crime of genocide. Now, the Trial Chamber brought Witness TAW. That witness had the gift of being everywhere at once, for having claimed, to having heard, seen or even guessed things, whereas he wasn't there. It was this witness who said that early in the morning on the 7th of April 1994, the accused met Major Ndekezi at the temporary gendarmerie camp in Rwanteru. He met Major Nsabimana at the military camp of la chute and, in the same day, Colonel Rwagafirita of the gendarmerie. That appears in the judgement of paragraph 42. He even adds that the Accused, as the secretary of the commune, to type a message intended for the conseiller de secteur summoning them to a meeting the next Saturday, namely, the 9th of April 1994. He even states that the message was given to the persons concerned by the communal policemen. And this appears in the judgement, paragraph 43. Yet today, in the case before, it is public knowledge that in 1994, there was never a gendarmerie camp in the Rusumo commune, that there was no Major Ndekezi in Rusumo, let alone a Major Nsabimana in 1994 in Rusumo. The Prosecutor, who, at the time, had the possibly to verify or to check on such evidence, did not engage in that exercise. The Defence tendered a document titled, "Situation of the officers or status of the officers in the Rwandan army" from the ministry of defence and dated 5th of March 1994. And in that document, it is clear that there was no gendarmerie major serving in the Rusumo commune in April 1994 and that there was no gendarmerie officer by the name Rwagafirita in that unit on that date. Well, as for the summoning of anyone, the Trial Chamber felt that it was an insignificant diversion. That appears on judgement, paragraph 83. The Accused stated further on the 7th of -- that on the 7th of April, he met his superior, a neighbour in the service, a sous-préfet by the name Joseph Habimana. TAW stated that on the 8th of April 1994, the Accused participated in a meeting not far from Kibungo that was summoned and chaired by the so-called Colonel Rwagafirita, where, in actual fact, the said meeting was summoned and chaired in the meeting hall of the préfecture by the préfet, Ruzindana, Godfroy. That meeting was read over the radio, and the tape was disclosed by the Prosecutor to the Defence, and that appeared as exhibit -- or tendered as exhibit here. But the Trial Chamber didn't take that into account. TAW, since he is the only one, stated before the Court that on the 9th of April, the Accused presided over a meeting which was attended by conseiller, heads of cellule, and representatives of political parties. He claimed that one conseiller, who was heard as Witness TBH before this Court, participated in that meeting. And he said that at the meeting a discussion was held with respect to the distribution of weapons for the destruction of the Tutsis. In addition, Prosecutor brought Witness TBH, who was a conseiller, who is alleged to have told TAW that there was a distribution of weapons or the promise was made that weapons would be distributed for the destruction of the Tutsis. And that was on the 25th of August 2003, that that testimony was provided. TBH stated before this Court that during that meeting, which he attended, there was no question on -- no issue raised with respect to the distribution of weapons. Mr. President, Your Honours, my own humble experience cannot be compared to yours, but for the first time, this witness, TBH, for more than 20 minutes, not even being questioned by the Prosecutor, not even by the Defence, but by the Bench, he said he had never heard of any such meeting prior to his arrival in Arusha to testify as a witness. Later on, you will understand that he came to Arusha in 2003, whereas in that indictment dated 2001, there are paragraphs dealing with what he said. We will get back there. When TBH said that he said nothing to anyone, we had expected the Trial Chamber to note that inconsistency between what TAW said and what this witness said. Despite that flagrant inconsistency, the Trial Chamber found that there was corroboration in those testimonies. TAW said on the 10th of April 1994, the Accused collected boxes or cartons, depending on the versions, and those boxes contained weapons. Whereas, during the trial, he was the only one to have seen the cartons or boxes containing weapons. In the course of cross-examination, he said he did not touch any of those boxes, nor did he see the type of weapons contained therein. He then added, "I did not have the strength to offload those cartons. I stayed in the vehicle, and I was worried." That was during the session of the 20th of August 2003, page 70, paragraphs 26 to 29. Yet in paragraph 58 of the judgement, it is alleged that he assisted the Accused in offloading 15 boxes or cartons. Yet, the witness had said, "I didn't touch those boxes," whereas in the judgement it is stated that he assisted the Accused in offloading the boxes. And yet on that same day of the 10th, there were disturbances in the same secteur of Nyamugali, and the Accused was involved, allegedly. And for the Accused to be involved, he was assisted in this by AU3, a Defence witness. The Chamber admitted that AUW <stage>(sic)</stage> was acting by deduction, and this is in the judgement at paragraph 84. It is said that he was acting on the basis of deduction. This is a witness who is acting on the basis of deduction, and he is forgetting that what he said is going to lead to a sentence -- sentencing of someone who is 53 years old. TAW admitted at the end of his cross-examination, he said that he could not lie on this point, whereas he had already amply done so on other matters, namely, that the Accused did not know how to handle weapons. If he said that, he admitted implicitly and necessarily that he had already lied. When he was examined on the 20th of August 2003, AW <stage>(sic)</stage> said that there was one certain Sebundani who said, "Your Honours, when we arrived in Arusha on the 1st of February 2006, the Prosecutor disclosed to us -- urgently disclosed to us information dealing with disclosure of disculpatory <stage>(sic)</stage> evidence by the Prosecutor on appeal." Your Honours, my speech of a few moments ago may be representing anything, but this is what I have become in February 2006, in other words, a few days before the hearing before this Chamber. And this disclosure was done on the basis of Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. In other words, each time that the Prosecutor is in possession of evidence which might exculpate the Accused, this evidence should be produced and disclosed to the Defence. May I continue, Mr. President? </p>

            <p>Thank you. Thank you. I was saying, Mr. President, and I'm sure you yourselves received the same document, this disclosure which the Prosecutor has just given, as we speak, but it is difficult, Your Honours. This document is dated 18th March 2003. The Prosecutor claims that it has just received a document which was dated 18th March 2003. It's not the date which is important. What you need to see in this document ******************* allegedly was at the commune and was allegedly sacked by Gacumbitsi two years earlier, and that's what is said. The last sentence of his testimony to the Prosecution is important: "It is not because at the time I had been **************************** at the commune that I allegedly made these allegations against Gacumbitsi. That is not true." Gacumbitsi was sentenced in 2004, and the document was in October, but we did not receive it. Your Honours, when I asked A -- TAW at the time, "While you were there, who was helping Gacumbitsi?" And then they gave the name of this witness. And even before the testimony of that witness, **********************, he said that in April 1994 he was a farmer. And he, at the time -- in 2003 he was at Nsinda prison. Now, if you have found that passage, Your Honours, I will come back to what I had told you earlier regarding TBH. The Prosecutor did not look but for witnesses who had had problems with Gacumbitsi before the events of 1994. And we'll come back to this in a moment, and you will see how a document can be fabricated, how evidence can be trumped up. And it is done with a great deal of finesse. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. You know when you want to arrest somebody and have him sentenced, anything is possible. But I am happy to note that the Appeals Chamber will see in different light what we have done. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, Your Honours, I was saying that the other disturbing witness by the Prosecutor is Witness TBH. TBH was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in Rwanda. He came before the Trial Chamber, and he testified that he attended the meeting and that Gacumbitsi never spoke of any distribution of weapons but that Gacumbitsi had asked them to go and kill Tutsis. When he is asked whether during his trial in Rwanda he mentioned Gacumbitsi's name, he says that he did so on several occasions, in his confession and during trial. I looked at the judgement and his confessions, but the name does not appear. The Chamber stated that he was a credible witness. TBH is one of the rare witnesses who said during trial that the Prosecutor came to see him on a Friday to tell him that the statements that he had done previously were not in conformity with others and he needed to change them so that he could come and testify before the Trial Chamber. He said this in public, but in the judgement it is stated or determined that that witness is a credible witness. The other witness is the famous Witness TBI who is sentenced at Nsinda prison. He states that Gacumbitsi allegedly asked a group of 40 people, both Hutus and Tutsis, to kill Tutsis. He states further that on the same day, Gacumbitsi asked André Nyandwi to stop Tutsis from crossing the Akegera river in boats. And that was on the 14th of April. But this version of facts by TAW, he said that these events took place on the 10th of April. And this is appearing at paragraph 58 of the judgement. The Accused is asking that Tutsis be killed before 40 or 50 people, both Hutus and Tutsis. On the same day, the 14th, he too tells the people who killed the Tutsi, says, "Do not kill the conseiller de secteur because he's a Tutsi." And that witness said that this Tutsi is alive, and his property was never looted. This is at paragraph 80 of the judgement, Your Honours. It is said that Tutsis were supposed to be killed, and the secteur conseiller was not supposed to be killed. The person is allegedly alive, and his property was never -- was never looted. The Defence provided sufficient evidence that from the evening of the 13th April 1994, the Accused was hiding following death threats from wrongdoers following consecutive arrests and security meetings. RDR said that on the 14th of April he saw neither the Accused nor any official or responsable from the secteur. He further said and testified that there was never any meeting in his area in April 1994. There was sufficient -- the Defence adequately showed that there was abundant counter-truths in this case. TBJ is the one who claimed that he walked 10 kilometres in one hour, and he testified before the Trial Chamber Judges that they could not find the Accused in Kigarama, and yet, TBJ also could not find him. He could not find the Accused in Kigarama, because that person had, from the 13th, been in hiding. From the witness statements one fact stands out. Besides the detainees who have come from Rwanda to testify, no one met or saw the Accused on the 14th of April 1994. The Chamber, in concluding that these -- these witnesses were credible, committed a serious error of fact which invalidates the conclusions in the judgement and, thereby, the verdict. Your Honours, each time that I give you the name of a witness, I am telling you what is the relationship between that witness and the Accused. I have spoken about his driver who testified before the Trial Chamber, a friend from many years, did not protect his -- his property, whereas he had left him a letter. Gacumbitsi was his friend, and he was going to look after his children. I hope that when he was saying this, he was believing that before your Chamber, people were still being condemned to death, and yet, this is not the case. TAQ. I spoke about the finesse of the Prosecution. Who was TAQ? TAQ is a young woman, a Tutsi woman, who ******************************************************************************************* repudiated her, and ************************************************************************************* husband. And the Accused tried in vain to have that marriage restored, but he failed, and that was a humiliation for him. And that is how the Prosecutor came to look for her. TBH was ********************************, and he was in position, but when -- </p>

It's the judgement which gives the identity of the witness. And I only provided the pseudonym. It's in the judgement, and the judgement is public. Please take paragraph 109, and the witness is described in full. I am not the guilty party in this case. Let me proceed by your leave, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, we shall now be moving to the fourth ground of my appeal, but this -- we shall come back to this witness much later, because when we look at the matters which deal with this particular point, it is the witness who testified that she saw Gacumbitsi at the Nyarubuye parish on the 15th and the 17th of April 1994. On the 17th of April 1994, TAQ said the following before the Chamber: "I was hiding in the bushes," she claims. "I saw a convoy of three vehicles going past. In those three vehicles megaphones were being used. I recognised Gacumbitsi's voice." When asked by the Judge whether she saw Gacumbitsi in the vehicle, she answered no. "Who did you recognise in the vehicle for you to say that that was Gacumbitsi's vehicle?" She answered, "I recognised his driver, the driver." "What was his driver's name?" ************************* And that statement has just been disclosed to us by the Prosecution, and that was taken in 2003.

            <p>Your Honour, again I'm loath to interrupt, but the material which my learned friend is relying upon does not form part of the judgement, it does not form part of the trial record. It was disclosed recently as part of the Rule 68 disclosure by the Prosecution. If my learned friend wishes to use that evidence or that material in any way, in my submission, it should be done properly, that is, by way of a Rule 115 application. That is, he must demonstrate how it satisfies the criteria laid down by Rule 115. It is unfortunate the evidence -- or the material was disclosed so late. However, that does not permit my learned friend to come here now and use the material in that way and circumvent the Rule 115 procedure. I respectfully submit that my learned friend withdraw the submission he's just made. If my learned friend does wish to rely upon the document that he does have, the application should be brought in the proper way. Those are my submissions. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Much obliged, Mr. President, Your Honours. Mr. President, Witness TAO claimed before the Judges of the Trial Chamber that he saw Gacumbitsi at the Nyarubuye parish on the 15th of April at 1300 hours. And this witness said at trial that Gacumbitsi arrived. Initially he saw the witness arrive, and then later on he, rather, saw his vehicle arrive. And this is at paragraph 119 of the judgement. And that some time later he took a machete and cut off Murefu's head. Mr. President, having been heard on the 15th of April 1994, in other words, four years after the events, TAO did not mention anything about this cutting off of Murefu's head. This is such a horrible scene, and how can it be forgotten in such a short period of time? But since he was heard on the 20th and on the 30th and the 31st, maybe the Trial Chamber felt that what the witness had said was credible. When you look at the Prosecution witnesses' statements, statements which were not either consistent nor corroborated, the Defence produced Witness NG2, who was living in Rukira commune, was one such witness. And he was amongst the attackers at Nyarubuye parish. And he said that he never saw the Accused there. ZHZ was amongst the assailants, and he was also living in Nyarubuye. He stated that on the 14th of April there was an attack on Nyarutunga at the Birembo area, and that the attack was led by gendarmes from Murundi, and that it was the same gendarmes who were later to be seen at the parish on the 15th. Given the events that took place in Nyarubuye, Your Honours, for which the Defence has done a great deal of work, the Accused has always denied his participation, not only because he was against violence in his commune and -- because he was also informed of this on the 16th of April by someone who was living in Birembo, and it is claimed that this information came from one Brigadier Neza. Paragraph 133 and 134 of the judgement. He never said any such thing. Regarding the credibility of witnesses, I said a moment ago that the Chamber had found all witnesses to be credible, despite what I have said to you earlier. But the Chamber is full of praise and determined that the witness statements, statements of witnesses for Prosecution, and it -- the Chamber simply or merely concludes that it had taken note. Honourable Judges of the Appeal Chamber, you will see that the Judges of the Trial Chamber said that the testimony of the Defence witnesses were true, but there is some disequilibrium, and this is in relation to the presentation of evidence by the Prosecution and by the Defence, whereas Article 20 of the statute recommends that there be fairness and equality of arms. We did not benefit from any such equality, Your Honours. In the provision of evidence for count 1, in other words, genocide, the Accused is reproached for having been guilty of murder for members of the Tutsi ethnic group and for having caused serious bodily harm with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group. To find an accused person guilty of the genocide, the Chamber must be convinced that he had the requisite intent under Article 2 of the statute. Then it must be demonstrated that the alleged perpetrator committed one of the acts spelled out with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group as such, based on national, racial, ethnic, or religious grounds. That position was set out various times by international jurisdictions. Let me mention Ntakirutimana, paragraph 784, the Bagilishema judgement, paragraphs 60 and 61, Musema, paragraph 164, and Rutaganda, paragraph 49. In the rightfully impugned judgement, the Chamber rightfully points out that to destroy, in whole or in part, an ethnic group does not imply a numeric approach. It is sufficient to prove the Accused acted with intent to destroy a substantial part of the target group. Judgement, paragraph 258. In their factual findings, the Chamber found that the Accused did murder Murefu, and yet, the Accused not only denied killing anyone, even more, he was never prosecuted for killing a certain Murefu. The indictment is the sole charging instrument. Nowhere does it list the name of Murefu. Here it is important to point out the essential elements of a crime in response to the seven following questions necessary for any investigation for Prosecution for the judgement: First, who committed the crime? Where was the crime committed? When was it committed? What was committed or omitted? Who is the victim? What is the meaning of the crime? And why was the crime committed? Your Honours, each time that an investigator, a Prosecutor, or Judges do not respond to those criteria, there are strong chances that the decision is defective. As I was saying earlier, TBJ declared that the witness said that no Hutu should be touched, but incited that Tutsis should be killed, unfortunately, was proven that the Accused was never in any of these places on the dates indicated. All of these things, Mr. President, Your Honours, come from the fact that the indictment against Gacumbitsi was not on indictment at all with regard to genocide, for which the Chamber found that Gacumbitsi gave the signal to kill by killing Murefu -- by cutting off, rather, Murefu's head. I should like to read a few names. Here are the victims spelled out in the indictment. There are 14 of them: Kagumya, Gahondogo, Runuya, Maniriho, Kagumya, Gashumba, Mutempundu, Mukabera, Nyamvura, Mukadusabe, Bimenyimana, Uwiragiye, Mugiraneza, Tuyiringire in paragraph 12 of the indictment, paragraph 28 of the indictment. Those are the 14 victims mentioned by the Prosecution in the indictment. In the judgement you have before you, Your Honours, there is no mention of any one of those. None of them were adduced in evidence or talked about in evidence, and yet, the Chamber found new and different victims. Here are you: Murefu, Simon Buhonogo, Rugegena, Tassiana Mukamwiza, Marie, Béatrice, Rukomeza, Mutunzi, Vianney. In paragraph 152, 176, paragraph 176, 179 -- </p>

Next, you can submit your arguments with regard to the fact that Mr. Murefu's murder was not mentioned. As such, you will shed light on matters for the Chamber, and this certainly could help us in coming to an opinion on these matters. Thank you. </p>

            <p>Absolutely, Your Honour. That is why, unfortunately, I must move quickly, and I am taking into account what time it is. And I do not want to go beyond the time that has been given to me. As I was saying, Your Honours, regarding to those -- with regard to those crimes, the Chamber committed an error in law saying that the Accused was guilty under 6.1 of the statute by virtue of his planning the alleged act with others. This is in the judgement, paragraph 271. In its legal submissions the Defence refuted at length the existence of others who had planned to commit genocide. The Prosecution -- the Prosecution failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of all the people mentioned by Witness TAW. The Accused could not have planned the crime alone, as planning presupposes that several people get together to conceive the crimes, the mode of perpetration and the possible consequences. The Prosecutor never undertook such an exercise. Gacumbitsi in those conditions attempted to prove his innocence. Normally the Prosecution must prove his guilt. We proved that we didn't do anything. Where, in fact, we should have -- that should not have been the case. As I was saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, Trial Chamber III to find the Accused guilty of genocide did not establish the dolus specialis of the Accused. Even if the motive is generally not a constitute of element of responsibility of crimes under the ICTR's jurisdiction, it may partially cover the special interests required to qualify the genocide and certain other crimes; that is true, legally. But I continue. I will say, Your Honours, the legal assessment of genocide comes in after the facts, the facts committed or qualified. If we don't have the facts, how can we validly qualify them? I spent all of my time this afternoon demonstrating to you that the facts indicated didn't -- never existed. If they don't exist, Mr. President, Your Honours, it's not jurisprudence or doctrine that will create them. Facts will lead to a trial. Facts and acts committed that are given a legal qualification, if they don't exist, how on earth -- pardon me, Mr. President, Your Honours. Judges are told such and such a man killed. Judges know he didn't kill. The Accused cannot defend himself. What must we do? The Judges know he didn't kill anyone. We are raising different theories of law. When you start out with facts, I broke them down. From the very beginning Gacumbitsi said this that he didn't do anything. It is in that context that I challenged his guilt on the count of genocide. Dolus specialis, Your Honours, requires that people act not only with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group qualified as such, but he has a willingness to achieve the result but also the consequences following from his actions. They say Gacumbitsi asked that all the Tutsis be killed prior to the 12th, but he also said, "Don't kill any Tutsis in my secteur." The criteria set out in law is that a person who is killed must belong to a targeted group because that group people seek to destroy in whole or in part. Either Gacumbitsi asked that they be killed or he didn't ask that the Tutsis be killed. Your Honours, serious harm to the physical or mental integrity of members of the Tutsi ethnic group, with your leave, shall be examined when we look at rape. But for the time being, the Chamber committed an error of law and fact by using the same facts to qualify genocide and extermination. Namely, the Chamber, to find Gacumbitsi guilty of genocide, said that he killed Murefu. The Chamber then said Gacumbitsi is guilty of extermination on the basis of the fact that he killed Murefu. And yet, it was shown abundantly that nobody knows who Murefu is. The Prosecutor accuses Gacumbitsi to have personally committed criminal acts. He must spell them out in the indictment: The basic facts, such as the identity of the victim, the time and place of the crime, and the mode of perpetration. The Chamber decided as such in Semanza in the judgement of 15th May 2003 in paragraph 45. For such serious acts, the Prosecutor absolutely had to specify the identity of the victims, perhaps not totally, but at least by indicating who they were, and he could base his arguments on that. It doesn't seem to me -- Your Honours, you will see that with regard to that requirement to identify the victims, the indictment and the judgement of the judgement of the Chamber are completely opposed to one another. No resemblance, no common traits between the indictment and the judgement with regard to Gacumbitsi's actions regarding those people who were killed. I told the Chamber, and you will find this in my submissions. For example, contrary to Articles 18 -- 17 and 18 in the statute, one of the witnesses who's mentioned in the indictment was only heard on 12 November 2002. Gacumbitsi was arrested, therefore, and after that, they went looking for elements that could support their indictment. But in law, you need the facts and elements in hand, and with those you put the indictment before the Judge to confirm or not the indictment. I raised this issue in 2002. Unfortunately, the Prosecution -- and I believe they produced evidence -- told the Tribunal. When we get to the merits, you will have an opportunity to assess this. In another document, Mr. President, Your Honours, and the Prosecution acknowledged this -- this was also disclosed to me on 2 February when I arrived in Arusha -- they acknowledged that their indictment was vague and unspecific.

            <p>That is correct, Mr. President. But the document I have just raised is not a reference document. There is another one. It is not part of the trial record. It's completely different. And the Chamber's observation -- as you see, I have two different documents. This was not the document. I know what I will do with it in due time. What I was talking about was a different document. Let me proceed, with your leave, Your Honour. As I was saying before I was interrupted, the Defence believes that the vague and speculative nature of the indictment is aggravated by the fact that Gacumbitsi must answer to cumulative offences on the basis of acts that cannot be attached to a single indictment. The Defence submits that in law it is inadmissible to charge both genocide and crimes against humanity purely on the basis of the same facts. Furthermore, it is inadmissible to try a single individual in one indictment for genocide and complicity in genocide when he is the only person being tried. During his trial before the Trial Chamber, the Accused stated that following death threats on the 12th and 13th of April, he became frightened and went into hiding. So to find him guilty of extermination and rape, the Chamber never said what they made of that alibi. He said that during the 15th, 16th, 17th and following days he was hiding, and since hiding he was not able to write down in his diary what he was doing. Even the Trial Chamber acknowledged on several occasions that the Accused was hiding, but he did not mention -- pardon me. Even the Trial Chamber acknowledged on several occasions that the Accused person was hiding, but they didn't mention whether or not that influenced their decision. This can be found in the judgement, paragraphs 81, 133 and 141. That is why, Your Honours, that alibi was never dealt with, we submit. And we propose to you that you rule and find that from the evening of the 13th to the next day, Gacumbitsi, since he was threatened with death, was hiding, and because he was hiding, the people who came to see him could not have seen him. That's science fiction. They couldn't see him, and if he wasn't there, he couldn't commit the crimes; and if he couldn't commit the crimes, it would be abnormal for him to be convicted on the basis of those acts. </p>

            <p>Most obliged, Your Honour. I will do my best to respect those orders. Mr. President, Your Honours, I am now dealing with ground of appeal regarding rape as a crime against humanity. Mr. President, the Trial Chamber found Gacumbitsi guilty of rape under Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the statute, because the Accused allegedly incited TAQ and another woman to be raped. The Defence established that that witness was not credible. It is important to say that the Prosecution never proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there was such incitement to rape. And that the Accused ever incited individual criminal responsibility to incur, under Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> to be met, means that a rape must have been committed, but also that those committing the rapes have acted on the orders of the Accused. That presupposes a three-way correlation between the alleged rape, the alleged perpetrators and the Accused person. Yet, the only witness, TAQ, never saw the witness <stage>(sic)</stage> on the 17th of April. For his part, the Accused never saw those who may have raped TAQ. We must say that those rapists, who were depicted as assailants who were chasing cattle, never saw the Accused, according to TAQ. The only crime he is convicted of is the rape of TAQ and the other woman, and yet TAQ said that she did not see Gacumbitsi, but she said that Gacumbitsi said some things through the megaphone to other people, and those things incited people who were chasing cattle to go and rape. TAQ did not see Gacumbitsi. Gacumbitsi did not see any attackers. The assailants did not see Gacumbitsi. How can we then talk about incitement in such circumstances, Your Honours? The Prosecution must undertake that exercise. I know that in 1994 there were many events in Rwanda, but here we are dealing with Gacumbitsi alone. For incitement to be established, we need this three-way requirement. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Counsel, is it your submission that incitement to rape can only be committed in the way you tried to convince us that the inciter has to be present when the crime is committed, and, additional, the victim has to see or to be aware that the alleged inciter is at the crime site? Is this really your submission? </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Your Honour. That is only a second part. On the 17th of April 1994, Witness TAQ said he <stage>(sic)</stage> heard the voice of the Accused over a megaphone. She did not see the Accused but heard his voice, but she saw his driver in the Accused's vehicle, but not the Accused. Following that speech, she was raped, along with another woman. The Judges say Gacumbitsi is guilty for that rape because he incited the rapists. That is the issue here in this case, Your Honour. Following recommendations from Mr. President, we had some reservations. We reserved our arguments. You will see, Your Honours, the driver spoken about did not exist. It was never proven that Gacumbitsi was present. The only witness to this didn't see him. She saw the driver. The driver wasn't there. Gacumbitsi says that, "I was in hiding." Now, we have only the rapists who remain. No one saw them either. The victims -- and the victim is the only witness -- and this was only the second part of my argument, not the first. We start with the facts and then examine them with the law. This case of rape could not have existed. The constitutive elements for it, especially the material elements -- the lack of material facts, were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Your Honours, can we convict someone for incitement if the person herself doesn't know who incited, if we don't know what the incitement contained? Here is someone who was hiding in a hole for days and days because people wanted to kill him, and now they say that 30 kilometres away from where he was staying, he is guilty of inciting rapes. That is why I wanted to go over the legal elements of that crime. But I started with the facts, and I hope that this answers your question. </p>

            <p>I have a follow-up question, Counsel, following that of my honourable colleague, Judge Schomburg. Perhaps, regarding the ground of appeal dealing with rape as a crime against humanity, ground of appeal number 4, perhaps it would be useful for you to shed light on the matter by answering the question: Were the rapes part of a generalised and systematic attack? And the definition given of a systematic and generalised attack, what do you make of it? The Trial Chamber gave a definition regarding the systematic and generalised attack -- a widespread and generalised attack. Do you, first of all, agree with that definition? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honours, the definition of a widespread attack given by the Trial Chamber is a legal one. The definition of widespread and systematic attack is qualified. Now, the question is the following: In Rusumo commune, regarding that date and those acts, was there a widespread and systematic attack? In the indictment and supporting materials, Prosecutor says that in Rusumo commune, in particular, and in Rwanda, in general, between the 1st of January and the 31st of December 1994 there were widespread and systematic crimes committed. Perhaps that was the case. Perhaps judicial notice was taken in other cases, but that wasn't the case here. A widespread attack was not the basis of this allegation against Gacumbitsi with regard to the rape of TAQ and the other woman. Even if we supposed, Your Honours, that there was a widespread and systematic attack, we must demonstrate that the Accused was part of the attackers and that he had 6 <stage>(1)</stage> or 6 <stage>(3)</stage> responsibility. I have no problem whatsoever with the legal definition, but does it fit with this trial? That is the problem that this Honourable Chamber has to deal with. For the Defence, the answer is quite simply no, for the reasons that I spelled out and that I have also tried to explain to you. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Most obliged, Mr. President. Many submissions have been made with regard to the crime of rape. Let me now deal with the last point in my appeal. Your Honours, Gacumbitsi was convicted with a sentence of 30 years. On the day of judgement he was 61 years old. We had indicated, and submitted, and it was acknowledged, even by Prosecution witnesses, that Gacumbitsi was a model teacher, that Gacumbitsi was an honest bank manager, and that he was a model bourgmestre. In their opening statement of 28 July, even the Prosecution says that he had "great relationships with the people, even with the Tutsis." He had a brick-making operation with one of his Tutsi friends, even.Mr. President, Your Honours, the life expectancy in Africa is now 45 years. Just a few years ago it was 40 years. Gacumbitsi is over 60. If for some extraordinary reason you haven't followed me, if for some extraordinary reason you grant the Prosecution's request, and you must convict, do you believe that an old man, 63 years, who is before you today, can have the same sentence as someone who is 30 or 35? Gacumbitsi has a family. He's a father of six, Your Honours. I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that Gacumbitsi has an entire family that still lives in Rwanda. His wife and children do. Despite the fact that he is in prison in Arusha, Gacumbitsi is known in society as someone who did nothing.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Most obliged, Mr. President. Gacumbitsi has a family in Rwanda. His wife and children are there. If Gacumbitsi committed the acts alleged against him, there would have been revenge on his family. Even Prosecution witnesses acknowledged this: That thanks to Gacumbitsi many people were saved. Mr. President, Your Honours, perhaps this man will stand before you tomorrow and you will see -- I am asking you to do this, not simply because you have pity on him, but to do it based on the UN resolution that created this Tribunal. Mr. President, let me remind you: You remember that I wrote a letter to you telling you that there was a trial in Brussels, Belgium, regarding events at Nyarubuye. During that trial, there were two accused persons with more than 50 witnesses. It demonstrated adequately that those who were being prosecuted were rich businessmen. They organised, they prepared, and financed, and funded, and personally killed and raped during the events in Rwanda. The Judges in Brussels convicted those category 1 criminals to ten and 12 years respectively. One of your missions, Your Honours, with regard to that resolution is to promote the reconciliation of the Rwandan people. For Gacumbitsi, his family and children are in Rusumo in the same neighbourhood, in the same home. Your decision must allow him to go back to his children. Many want to return home -- there are not many who would not want to return home. And so, Mr. President, a conviction for 30 years -- a sentence of 30 years is not a sentence of hope, especially based on the facts that the events as I described never occurred. The last thing I wish to say, Mr. President, which is why I said that the court of assizes in Brussels gave me the judgement. One of the witnesses I mentioned, who figures in my submissions, is a complainant in that trial in Brussels, is claiming damages -- is claiming damages in Brussels and has requested damages during the entire time they were before that tribunal or that court. At no point in time did he ever say that he saw Gacumbitsi with those people who were tried in Brussels. Your Honours, Mr. President, taking into account the time allotted to me -- as I was saying, Mr. President, the last thing -- the last request that I make of you on behalf of Gacumbitsi, in the case you are still not convinced, is to be part of the history of that country. Give Gacumbitsi a sentence of hope. He wishes to go back to his family. In so doing, I am convinced that you will have administered sound and equitable justice. I thank you very much, Your Honours, for your kind attention. </p>

            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, our submission is that the evidence -- or the material -- to use a neutral term -- material has now come to light. The Prosecution in disclosing the material did so, if I may say so, out of an abundance of caution. We take a certain position that the material does not exculpate the Accused, but it potentially may be seen by others to have that affect, so that is why out of fairness it was disclosed. That being so, we say that if the material -- for the material to be considered by this Court, the material, as it was not part of the trial record -- and I don't seek to blame anyone for that -- but as it was not part of the trial record, the onus is now upon the appellant to show that that material could satisfy either the threshold test under Rule 115, that is, it either could or would affect the verdict. We, of course, say that it can never satisfy that test on its face. Now that material has been disclosed, the appelllant is trying to make use of that material to draw certain conclusions of fact. That witness has not, of course, been subject, for example, to cross-examination. We submit that the only mechanism provided for under the Rules of Procedure and Evidence for the reception of such evidence is under Rule 115, and the appellant has not tried to do that. As it is not part of the trial record, he cannot go behind the trial record and use it now in the form that he was using it. If the appellant wishes to make any use of it, we submit that it should be done in the form of a Rule 115 application. They are my submissions, Your Honour. </p>

Mr. President, Your Honours, serious crimes against humanity, genocide, extermination, acts of violence, are so serious, and quite often are committed on such a scale as well, if you were to ask a Prosecutor to identify all the victims, say, a thousand deaths or a thousand murders, that would not be easy. No human being can ask that of a Prosecutor, Mr. President. I fully am aware of that. However, Mr. President, in those circumstances, I have never been a prosecutor -- where the Prosecutor says in Arusha on the 8th of February 2006 there were 10,000 deaths, and everyone does recognise that there were a lot of deaths, and then on the day of trial he is going to produce people who are going to identify those who are dead - died -- sorry. That is what is required in legal logic. Now, on the 12th, the Prosecutor provides the names, he provides the names, and I am sure -- I am looking at you -- that from your extensive career, it is the first time that all the names mentioned, all the victims were not subsequently maintained or upheld by the Appeals Chamber. Now, what worries me in this whole case is that it would appear as if the judgement substituted some other victims for that of the Prosecutor. Now, under the rules, say, 47, it says, "If the investigation allows for adequate or sufficient evidence in support of his submission that the victim has committed -- sorry, the Accused has committed <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> and an indictment is provided, together with all the supporting material, so these are the names that were provided." You see, when the confirming Judge sees the names of the victims, naturally he would be following the indictment. It is my view, Your Honours -- except my reasoning cannot hold water -- that what the Trial Chamber should have done was, of all the victims mentioned, none, indeed, existed, instead of going to seek out its own victims in order to convict Gacumbitsi. That is the requirement, sir. I am referring to the Trial Chamber, sir. I must have said Appeals Chamber, whereas I was talking about the Trial Chamber. </p>

            <p>In that matter, Mr. Kouengoua, we all commit lapses in lingua very often -- I do -- so that is not a matter for any degree of regret. What I have to ask you is this: Take the case which I have instanced. Suppose the Trial Chamber was in this position that it was satisfied that hundreds of people were killed; does the failure of the Trial Chamber to make a finding in respect of these 12 names conflict with the import of its finding that hundreds of people were killed? You see, when you read this indictment, it says -- paragraph 12 says, "Many civilian Tutsi were killed, among them Kagumya," et cetera. So these were only examples of the fact that many people were killed. What I want to know from you, is the failure of the Trial Chamber to make a finding in respect of these names which were specifically mentioned, is that necessarily in contradiction with its main finding that many people were killed, assuming that it so finds? </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. President, the most plausible position would have been the following. On the 12th, Prosecutor would mention people among the thousand that were killed. Then he appeared before the Court, and the Court discovers that there were some other people who were killed but who were not mentioned or listed by the Prosecutor. Then the Chamber, or the Court, would then add to the number of victims, that is, those already mentioned by the Prosecutor in the indictment. In other words, when reading the judgement, we shouldn't have ten or 14 victims, we should have, say, 24. That would make sense. What the Chamber is telling the Prosecutor, implicitly, is that the victims you are talking about in your indictment were not mentioned by any witness. And that is the truth. The Prosecutor acts on the basis of the information he obtains. The Prosecutor wasn't there when the acts were committed. He is not expected to provide the names of all the victims, but if he did so -- and Rule 47 is quite clear in this -- in other words, he carried out investigations. But the Trial Chamber cannot replace the Prosecutor -- when it comes to replace the Prosecutor. I do not believe -- and I did seek your leave -- in law, and in my own practice, a crime can be disqualified when it comes in a certain order that the Trial Chamber cannot replace or substitute or add some other victim. It cannot even identify a victim which was not mentioned in the indictment by the Prosecutor. So that is the issue, Your Honours. The victims appearing in the judgement are those mentioned with no reference. The Prosecutor surely must have conducted investigations and they must have been consistent. </p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Let me ask you another question, if I may. You referred to the killing of Murefu, and I believe you had in mind paragraph 285 of the judgement, which said, "Having mentioned the killing of Murefu, the Chamber, therefore, finds that he committed the crime genocide." And the Chamber was concerned there with the word "committed" as distinguished from the other words in Article 6, paragraph 1. Now, when you turn to page 43 of the judgement, you find that the Chamber found that the Accused -- "The Accused directed the attack and participated in it." You have 171, "The Chamber finds that the Accused directed the attack on the 16th of April and the attack of the previous day." And you find in paragraph 172 that the Chamber found that "The Accused directed the attacks against Tutsi civilian refugees, and personally took part in the attacks." So isn't that a little wider, do you think, than merely linking the genocide to the killing of Murefu? What I am putting to you is this: If you read paragraph 285 of the judgement, you get an impression that the committing of genocide -- you are not hearing me, Counsel? </p>

            <p>Let me go back. Yes, that could be the problem. That could be the problem. Well, if you look at page -- paragraph 285, 285, of the judgement, you get the impression that the Chamber was linking the committing of genocide to Murefu's killing. But when you look at the other paragraphs to which I have averted your attention, it looks there as if the Chamber was saying, "Well, look, he directed these attacks and he personally engaged in them." So does that -- is that susceptible of meaning that the Chamber took the view that this man committed genocide, not merely because of Murefu's death, but also because he participated in the attack, and he directed the attacks, and he personally engaged in them? </p>

            <p>Obliged, Mr. President. Mr. President, the problem here is that no reasonable person can say in this courtroom that in 1994 there weren't killings, or there weren't murders in Rwanda, and specifically, in the Rusumo commune, which is a correct global approach to the matter . But the problem -- and that is my concern -- it is that Gacumbitsi says, "I wasn't there." And the Prosecutor says, "You were there. And the evidence lies in the fact that you killed Gashumba, Mutempundu," et cetera, which is an element of evidence of the involvement or participation of Gacumbitsi in the attacks. Now, when the Judge weighs the evidence, notices that if we move in that direction, Gacumbitsi really was not there because these people mentioned here, "We don't know where the Prosecutor got them from." In the case of Murefu, they say that the launching of the attacks were initiated by the Accused, who killed Murefu. Yet, Your Honours, it was not during the trial that Gacumbitsi committed genocide. That genocide was committed in 1994. The indictment was prepared in 2001. When we received this indictment we drew the attention -- or we sought its amendment before the Trial Chamber. Even if the Prosecutor had wanted to bring in new elements, for instance, in the case of Murefu, according to Rule 50 the Prosecutor could have sought authorisation to amend this indictment. How can we bring in things that do not figure in the indictment before the Trial Chamber and such matters considered by the said Trial Chamber? Gacumbitsi mounted his defence on these 14 deaths appearing in the indictment. When the trial starts on the 21st of July, he is told that he has to defend himself against the death of Murefu, whereas that never appeared in the indictment. That is the problem I think. The requirement of the statute and the rules do clearly state that the Accused must be informed of what he has done so that he can mount his defence properly. Throughout this trial, we tried to defend ourselves based on those 14 deaths listed by the Prosecutor. At the end of it all, and at the very last minute, some ten deaths are pulled out of the hat. They don't appear in the list. And now we are being required to defend ourselves against those ten deaths. </p>

            <speaker>JUDGE SCHOMBURG:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Coming back to paragraph 12 of the indictment, where it reads, "Many civilian Tutsi were killed, among them" -- and then a number of names follow. Leaving aside for a moment those names, would you accept that among them, inter alia, Murefu would be one mentioned in the indictment among those, as it reads in paragraph 12? And then in paragraph 285, that "the Accused killed Murefu and thereby committed the crime of genocide." This is the factual side of my question. The legal side: Isn't it correct, that leaving aside all the other alleged victims, that it suffices for the crime of genocide that only one person was killed, that the core element of genocide is the intent to kill people. We have the attempt, if nobody is killed; but if only one is killed, then it amounts to genocide. Do you agree? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, when we talk about the crime of genocide, the approach is not necessarily in terms of numbers. To kill 20 people, 50, or 100, that can be done without it being referred to or qualified as genocide. Genocide arises when the perpetrator of such deaths or murders intends to destroy, suppress, all or part of a group based on racial, religious, political reasons. That is how genocide is defined. So even if you kill -- even if you injure one person within that definition, you could be found guilty. But you can throw a bomb in this courtroom and 200 people are killed, genocide wouldn't have been constituted. But just one person could be or could amount to genocide. So we agree on that. Your Honour, if the Prosecutor says that I have killed someone because the person was Tutsi, I must say, first of all, whether I killed, whether I did not kill, and I have to plead guilty or not guilty. For me to so plead, it must be stated in the indictment who they claim I killed. Now, the Prosecutor gave 14 names, and the Accused says, "I didn't kill anybody," and then the Judges say, "No, you didn't kill anybody of the 14th," but then there are new names. They could have added those new names in the indictment. The accusatory instrument before the Trial Chamber is the indictment. We don't go beyond the indictment. That is what triggers the trial. So, it is improper, it is irregular. If the accusatory instrument is vitiated, if it is vague and defective, as we say on our side, what does one do? I believe it is your heavy -- your duty to overturn, to quash, because in the final analysis, it is better for there to be 10,000 murderers free than one innocent person in detention. That could also serve as some genocide. That is my answer, Your Honour. </p>

            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, thank you, Mr. President. The Prosecution is ready to respond. I might say, at the outset, I will address the grounds concerning genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity and the sentence ground raised by the appellant. My colleague, Mr. Mugwanya, will raise the ground of rape, as a crime against humanity, and, if necessary, my colleague, Ms. Osea will address the first ground of appeal, that is, the ground concerning the alleged procedural issues which have been raised. Thank you, Your Honour. If the Court pleases, the case against the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, for the crimes of genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, and rape were perfectly straightforward. The evidence led by the Prosecution, and the evidence accepted by the Trial Chamber, shows beyond any reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellant. It is our submission that there has been nothing raised by the appellant today which could cause any reasonable trier of fact to come to the conclusion that the appellant was not guilty of the crimes of which he was convicted. It is our submission that it is necessary to look at all of the evidence which was called by the Prosecution against the appellant at his trial in an integrated manner, that is, to consider how the evidence of each witness coheres with the rest of the Prosecution case. We submit that when that is done, the only reference that one can reasonably draw is that the appellant is, in fact, guilty of the three crimes in question. Now, it is certainly the case, in almost any case where you have eyewitness identification evidence plays some part, where you have a number of eyewitnesses giving evidence about the activities of a person over a number of days, in different locations, in a dynamic situation, where those witnesses perceive from a different vantage point, that there will be differences between the accounts given. That, really, is merely just a reflection of human nature. The human beings, when seeing an event, when hearing an event, and recalling an event some years later will remember some things and may not remember others. It would be rare that three people, seeing events such as the ones described here would be able to give a perfectly consistent, a perfectly matching account. In fact, if that was done here, one would automatically become suspicious how witnesses would be able to do that. What the Prosecution has shown at trial, and on the appeal record is this: That there is a detailed narrative which shows that the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, from early April 1994, was involved in the planning of attacks upon the Tutsi community; he was involved in the distribution of weapons; he was actively involved in the instigation of systematic violence by the Hutu majority towards the Tutsi minority; that he himself took a direct and leading role in the commission of that violence. The body of evidence relied upon by the Prosecution comes from a number of different witnesses. Contrary to the submissions which we have just heard from learned counsel for the appellant, it is the case, as the Prosecution submits, that a number of those witnesses do, in effect, support each other, that they do -- as the appellant uses the term -- in law corroborate each other. Now when anyone takes this integrated approach to looking at the evidence, not only does one see that each individual witness stands alone as a reliable, credible witness as to the events to which they testified, but also the totality of the evidence. And I must stress that phrase, the totality of the evidence points unambiguously to the guilt of Mr. Gacumbitsi and, indeed, enhances the evidence of each individual witness. In evaluating the evidence, it is important to keep in mind that, of course, there is no requirement in any jurisprudence of this Tribunal, and there was certainly none cited by the appellant today which requires a witness to be corroborated. Furthermore, there is no requirement, whatsoever, that merely because a witness happens to be a victim or a survivor of an attack -- and obviously it is dealing with some traumatic event -- that their evidence must be approached with caution. Notwithstanding that, that seems to be the tenor of the appellant's written submissions and, if I may respectfully say so, the tenor of these submissions today. The evaluation of evidence is, quintessentially, a matter of impression for the Trial Chamber. The Trial Chamber are the ones best empowered to assess the reliability and credibility of an individual witness and to determine the probative weight of such a witness. This Chamber, of course, can only intervene if the appellant can indicate, can illustrate, can point to, some error in the approach of the Trial Chamber which shows that no reasonable trier of fact could have come to the conclusion which the Chamber did. If I may commence with the first batch of witnesses who were discussed today by learned counsel for the Appellant, the <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> about the Witnesses TBH and TAW, each of these witnesses, of course, is an important witness for the Prosecution. Furthermore, there has been nothing shown today, in my submission, which would cause any doubt to be cast upon the reliability of the testimony of either of those witnesses. TBH, as the Chamber will recall, gave evidence of attending a meeting convened by the appellant where there was discussion, in fact, if you like, instructions given by the appellant to his subordinate that the Tutsi majority within the préfecture, within the commune, were to be mobilised, as it were, mobilised to commit acts of violence against the Tutsi. TAW gave evidence of a meeting taking place, but not, of course, being present at that meeting. TAW said that TBH told him there was discussion of distribution of weapons. TBH later, of course, said that he could not recall that. Now, as I said, the evidence to the effect of these witnesses is very important to the Prosecution, shows that right from the outset the appellant was involved in the planning of systematic violence by the Hutu against the Tutsi. Now, contrary to what my learned counsel for the appellant submitted today, the mere fact that there is a discrepancy between the accounts of TAW and TBH does not mean that the accounts of one or both witnesses can now be rejected. It, of course, is axiomatic that is a matter for the Trial Chamber, it is a matter open for the Trial Chamber to accept all of the evidence of a witness, to accept some of the evidence of a witness and to reject some of the evidence of a witness. The test, which my learned friend seems to be submitting, was this, that unless there was a perfect dovetailing between the testimony of two witnesses, unless their evidence matches perfectly, that the evidence of both is inherently suspect. That proposition is unfounded in law. There is no <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> in jurisprudence which supports that proposition. Not only is it unsupported in law, it is our submission that, in fact, when you consider the evidence, it is actually quite a baseless submission. What we have is two witnesses giving evidence of an event in 2003; so, they are talking about an event that happened eight or nine years prior. Both of them, of course, later witnessed traumatic events. The mere fact that TAW may recall something which TBH doesn't, does not mean that TAW is a suspect witness. Nor does it prove the reverse, that TBH, of course, is not telling the truth. It is simply the fact that two men, after the event, recall matters differently. Now, it may be the case, of course, that TAW, knowing that the Accused did engage in -- or the appellant did engage in the collection and distribution of arms, and knowing that the appellant was involved in the systematic violence, one reason or another, subconsciously thought that TBH told him these things. It really does not matter. At the end of the day we have this, both men attended the meeting; both men talk about the appellant, Gacumbitsi, indicating that violence is to be done to the Tutsi minority by the Hutu. As I understand matters, the evidence of each man does, in fact, corroborate the evidence of each one. It is our submission -- and we set up the authorities in our written brief -- that it is not necessary for one witness to support another witness in every material way for their evidence to be supportive. It is enough, we submit, that the evidence of a witness in some material manner, some material particular, supports the evidence of the witness in question. We, therefore, submit that there was no reason at all, demonstrated by the appellant today, as to why any doubt should be cast upon the credibility and reliability of either man. That being said, the evidence of each man is undiminished; the evidence of each of them carries a significant degree of cogent and probative weight. The Trial Chamber has not been shown to have committed any error in its approach in the evaluation of the witnesses. It was further suggested by counsel for the appellant that a number of witnesses, including TPH, are suspect because they are either accomplices or have suffered some other criminal sanction in Rwanda. Again, we say it is axiomatic within the jurisprudence of this Tribunal that merely because a witness may be legally characterised as an accomplice, there is no requirement for corroboration. It is simply a matter for a Trial Chamber, assessing the witness, to determine what weight, if any, it will give to the witness's testimony. That was done here, but, as we said, the question is moot. There is, in fact, probative evidence for the witness of TBH. TBH, of course, is corroborated in a number of other ways. The witness gives evidence about the business of the appellant on the 14th of April 1994 where the appellant instigated violence by driving to various marketplaces, speaking through a megaphone and urging the Hutu to attack the Tutsi. TBH's account, of course, is supported by the Witness TBJ. Also you have the weight of the evidence of TBK and TBI who gave evidence of similar contact by the appellant at that time in other places. We submit that the evidence of these witnesses be considered as an integrated whole, which is the only proper way to approach the witness. It shows that TBH is both a reliable and credible witness.We submit that there was no error in the approach of the Trial Chamber. If the Court pleases, another matter which was raised by counsel for the appellant today is this: There was an attack made upon a large amount of the testimony of Witness TAW. The Witness TAW gave evidence of accompanying the appellant on the 7th of April 1994 at various military or paramilitary camps where a large number of boxes were loaded onto vehicles. There was some 105 boxes in total. There was an attack made upon the <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> of that evidence because it was said that TAW did not know what was inside them; he did not know the contents of the boxes. The appellant seems to be submitting that one cannot draw inferences from proven facts, that unless there is direct evidence of every fact, a Trial Chamber must, therefore, lapse into error, and this is how you <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> the evidence. This, again, cannot be so, and again we have addressed this matter in our written brief. The fact of the matter is this; there had been a meeting where the appellant, Gacumbitsi, had spoken about the need to begin a campaign of violence against the Tutsi. The witness, TAW, drives around with the appellant to various military camps where a large number of boxes are loaded onto vehicles. Now, it is true, of course, the witness does not see what's inside the boxes, he does not know the contents, but given those two salient facts, that is, that the appellant, Gacumbitsi, has indicated his belief or his intention that a campaign of violence was to start and that they are visiting military camps and loading boxes onto them, there is no other inference open, other than the boxes contained weapons of some description. Again, the learned counsel for the appellant has not demonstrated how the Trial Chamber may have lapsed into error, coming to that conclusion. Therefore, again, no error has been demonstrated in the Trial Chamber's approach. This Chamber now has no scope to intervene and overturn <stage>(unintelligible).</stage> The witness, TAW, was also attacked on the basis -- or criticised on the basis, I should say, that he named a number of military gendarme officers that the appellant was said to have spoken to when the weapons were collected. It was said that there was a document placed in evidence from the ministry of defence, which indicates that those officers could not have been at the relevant camps at the relevant time. Again, there is no reason to doubt the finding of the Trial Chamber on this point. The counsel for the appellant told the Court the relevant exhibit was cited 5 March 1994. So that's a month before the events in question. So, firstly, there may well be the case that in the time between the date of that document and the date of the events which we are considering, the offices, of course, did move to the location in question. Secondly, of course, it should be noted that the ministry of defence document is merely a hearsay document as such. But the important thing is this: How can that document, now, cast any doubt upon the reliability of TAW's evidence? The answer is he could not. There would be no impediment to those offices being in that place at that time. Therefore, we submit that there was no error in the approach of the Trial Chamber in the evaluation of the witness, TAW. Now, if the Court pleases, there was also an attack upon the testimony of those two witnesses because they gave different dates, as to the time when a person called André was allegedly spoken to by the appellant. Again, the mere fact that there might be a small discrepancy in dates, in our submission, does not show why the witnesses cannot be accepted. The fact of the matter is, as I submitted earlier, you are talking about witnesses giving evidence of matters some years later. There was no reason to suspect that the witnesses would have had any reason to make a contemporaneous record of any of those dates. The fact that there may be a four date discrepancy between the two witnesses about, essentially, the same matter cannot damage the credibility or liability of either witness. If anything, if you do have two witnesses giving evidence about essentially the same fact, then you have the appellant speaking to a person named André and asking him to stop the flow of refugees across the river, the fact that those witnesses gave, mutually support each other.The next body of criticism, as we understood the submissions made by counsel for the appellant, was this: There was a general attack upon the reliability of the three Prosecution witnesses, who observed the appellant at the parish, over the three-day period between 15 and 17 April, that is the period in which some -- well, a large number of refugees were killed, possibly some thousands of them were killed. Again, it is unclear, in our respectful submission, of what the complaint of the appellant is. As we submitted earlier, the mere fact that you have three persons who were part of a large crowd, and there was evidence there were many thousands of people at the parish, perhaps over 20,000, who obviously were seeing and hearing things from different vantage points, seeing and recalling things some years later in court, and seeing and hearing things which happened in a dynamic not a static situation, where there is movement, where there is talk, were there are acts of violence occurring. It is hardly surprising there would be any differences in what they recall what they give in evidence. But the important thing is this, that all three witnesses place the appellant, Gacumbitsi, at the parish. It is the case that, of course, some of them don't see him all three days, but that's by the by; that there was indication that Gacumbitsi arrived. That there was no significant violence occurring until Gacumbitsi arrives. And when Gacumbitsi arrives, there was a signal given and the violence begins in earnest. So, again, our submissions which we flesh out and try to <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> there was no material discrepancy which gives rise to any reason as to doubt the veracity of any of those witnesses in question. Now, they are, essentially, the factual matters, as I understood them, which were raised by the appellant in his oral argument today. With regard to alleged errors of law in the approach of the Trial Chamber, the position of the respondent, Prosecutor, of course, is that the Trial Chamber did not commit any errors in law at all, as we set out in our written brief. The approach of the Trial Chamber was typically orthodox and typically correct that the elements of the various crimes <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> and so forth was correctly set out, that the evidence which supports those counts was cogent and was correctly used by the Trial Chamber to find the appellant guilty. Firstly, it was said by the counsel for the appellant today that there was any error, as I understood it, in the Trial Chamber's evaluation of the so-called alibi, that is learned counsel referred to two paragraphs in the Trial Chamber judgement, paragraphs 81 and 131, where the witness gave -- I beg Your Honours' pardon -- the appellant, Gacumbitsi, gave evidence that he was at home in April during the times of the attacks. Firstly, it must be said that the only witness -- the only evidence relied upon by the Defence was that of the appellant himself. Secondly, it must be said that the Trial Chamber only decided guilt in the light of being persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the testimony of the Prosecution witnesses. So it must informally follow that the Trial Chamber rejected the evidence of the appellant when he said that he was not present at the scene. The Trial Chamber found on the evidence of a number of other witnesses going right back to witnesses TBH and TAW where he showed that there was that plan put in motion by the appellant, that the appellant, in fact, was at the relevant massacre scenes at the relevant time. So, the submission of the counsel for the appellant that there was not a proper consideration of the alibi, so the alibi is without foundation. It was also suggested by counsel for the appellant today that there was -- and I am paraphrasing what he said -- that there was a suggestion that there was not a proper evaluation of the Defence witnesses, mainly NG23 and ZHZ. This submission made by counsel for the appellant is without any substance. The Trial Chamber freely evaluated the evidence of both witnesses and we set out those reasons in our written brief, but the Trial Chamber, of course, is best placed to judge the credibility of witnesses. There were proper reasons for them not to accept the testimony of these two people. Firstly, of course, there was the case that they had accepted beyond a reasonable doubt the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses in question. Secondly, the evidence of NG2 had an air of <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> about it. He had given evidence that he was at the site for some six hours, that he joined in the looting but he did not join in the attack as such. He did not take part in the killings. The Trial Chamber would have been within its rights to consider that to be impossible. He was, as I said, was found, for a number of reasons to be an unsatisfactory witness. He was found to be not a responsible, credible witness under cross-examination. So, there was nothing raised by the appellant today which shows by either witness was not properly considered. The Trial Chamber, as we submit, was best placed to assess the credibility of witnesses, they had proper reasons for not being impressed by the evidence either of those two witnesses. They had proper reasons for not acting on their evidence, insofar as to exculpate the appellant's investigation BC <stage>(phonetic).</stage> So, our submission is simply this, that with regard to evaluation of evidence, there has been no error demonstrated in the approach of the Trial Chamber, in fact, quite the contrary. The Trial Chamber <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> the evidence of all relevant witnesses, including Defence witnesses that was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the Prosecution case. They were not <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> any doubt which was raised by anything the Defence said. They found the Defence witnesses lacked credibility. Dealing with some other matters raised by the appellant, it was submitted today, and it was also submitted by the appellant in his written brief, that mens rea cannot be established by drawing inferences, that is, by not looking at surrounding facts. Again, there was no authority cited by the appellant why that is said. We, in our written brief, addressed this at length. It would be a matter which would be repugnant to any sort of common sense or proper factual analysis to think that mens rea, that is the state of the person's mind, cannot be proved by surrounding external circumstances. It is simply a matter of one says, "I am going to do something," if one commits acts doing those things; it is <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> that they must have had the specific intent to do those matters. So we, again, said that submission must be <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> filed. There was also an attack launched by counsel for the appellant upon the strength or the adequacy of the indictment presented against the appellant at trial. This matter does not appear to be addressed in the appellants written brief, but it was submitted, as I understand it, that because the Prosecution had not proved or established beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the person's named or all of the persons named in paragraph 12 that that paragraph was, therefore, somehow, defective and the Prosecution counts of genocide and extermination must inevitably fail. Again, there was no authority cited for that other thing, Semanza's appeal case, paragraph 45, as we heard it, which does not, on our reading, have anything to do with the issue. The paragraph in question said that many Tutsi were killed amongst whom were a number of named persons. In our submission the proper instruction of that paragraph is this, those named persons are not an element of the prime, they're merely a particular raised by the Prosecution. Not being an element, it is not necessary for the Prosecution to prove the identity of those particular people. Now, to take the logical extreme of that, with a case that many thousands of people were killed at one massacre site, and it's safe for that conclusion to be drawn here, and, in fact, we urge that upon the Court. If that was the case, tracking the appellant's argument to its logical conclusion, it would be incumbent upon the Prosecution to prove the identity of every person killed in the massacre. That cannot be correct. The Prosecution was required to prove the appellant was criminally responsible for the killing of a large number of Tutsis at that place, at that time. That is what the Prosecution did. The appellant's argument must inevitably fail. If the Court pleases, there was also a submission made -- and I say this with the greatest respect to the learned counsel for the appellant -- it was not advanced in any detail, but it was submitted that the crimes of genocide and extermination would not stand based upon the same facts. And there was no, as I understood it, no argument really placed before the Court as to why this is to say <stage>(sic).</stage> Again, there was no authority advanced for that proposition and, again, there is no reason why charges should not stand on the same basis of facts. There is a <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> element in each count. Mr. President, there are the Prosecution's submissions we wish to make with regard to the counts of genocide and extermination and crimes against humanity, subject to any assistance we may give to the Court on those grounds.</p>

            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>May it please Your Honours, I'll be addressing the appeal for conviction for rape as crimes against humanity. From the oral submissions of learned counsel, he raised up, I could say, general complaint, one of them, it seems, that the witnesses called by the Prosecutor lacked credibility. I'll address that in a moment. But going through his written brief, he also complains about three main issues. One, he asserts that the Prosecutor failed to prove that Gacumbitsi instigated the rape. He complains that Witness THU gave evidence about Gacumbitsi instigating through a megaphone. To him, a megaphone distorted the voice of the Accused, therefore there was no proof that Gacumbitsi instigated the rape. The second complaint from the written material is that the Prosecutor failed to prove adequately a nexus between the instigation and the resulting rape. And then thirdly, he complains about the fact that the rapes were not part of widespread or specific attacks, against Tutsi civilians, that the Prosecutor failed to prove that. Your Honour, I'll address those four complaints in turn. I'll begin with the one which appellant raised in submissions -- oral submissions concerning the absence of credibility of witnesses. Your Honour, it is established jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber that it is up to the Trial Chamber or -- Trial Chamber is well-positioned to assess -- to hear witnesses, to assess their credibility, because they have the opportunity to see the witnesses and that the Appeals Chamber would not have intervened unless an applicant can demonstrate that the Trial Chamber reached conclusions which are wholly unreasonable. And this is set out in the case of Fedabeechie <stage>(phonetic)</stage> 793, Musema <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> 18 and other cases. So before an Appeal Chamber can intervene in a closed chamber system of witnesses an applicant must demonstrate the Trial Chamber reached a conclusion that was wholly unreasonable. Your Honours, learned counsel has not made a demonstration in this regard and, as I will demonstrate in a moment, the Trial Chamber considered evidence of witnesses called carefully, taking into account all the circumstances including a number of things, the fact that apart from Gacumbitsi instigating rape, he was a leader of massacres; he took part in massacres at other scenes. So the Trial Chamber was careful when it was looking at every witness in this case, and it hasn't been shown that the conclusions the Trial Chamber reached were wholly unreasonable, as required by jurisprudence I've just cited. Your Honour, I'll now go to the second complaint, namely that the Prosecutor failed to adduce evidence or didn't prove that Gacumbitsi instigated rapes. The Prosecutor relied on the evidence of Witness THU, again, a witness whom my learned counsel has tried to impugn. Of course he has not demonstrated how that witness is not credible. Your Honours, Witness THU gave evidence that on or about the 15th of April Gacumbitsi was going around to several communes in a couple of vehicles and from the vehicles people there were using megaphones, instigating Hutus to rape Tutsi women. Witness THU never testified he saw the Accused, as such, but she states in her evidence, and the Trial Chamber found this to have been established, that she recognised the voice of Gacumbitsi. Your Honour, looking at the total evidence, that conclusion that the witness recognised that voice was very reasonable, given, especially, THU's prior knowledge of the appellant, Your Honour. THU's knowledge of the appellant is extensive, and I wonder whether it is possible -- but I would want to refer to some closed session material, further materials that my friend was objecting to appellant's counsel was going into the details because this was given in closed session, and if it may please Your Lordships, I will go on if I may bear with you maybe five minutes of closed session where I can give the details of how Witness THU knew the appellant for quite a long time. I wonder whether that is possible, a closed session, very briefly, if that is possible. Otherwise, I can provide the transcripts, as well.</p>

            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Again, in line with the question of witness assessment, Your Honours, the jurisprudence of the Tribunal has -- I mean, has established that in assessing witness credibility, the Trial Chamber can look at -- or is enjoined to look at all the evidence and the circumstances holistically. As the Appeals Chamber has enjoined, Trial Chambers don't look at evidence in isolation, or <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> evidence in isolation. And it has enjoined Trial Chambers to look at evidence holistically. And this is contained in the Musema appeal judgement, paragraph 134. In this case the Trial Chamber, in assessing the witnesses, it looked at the total of the evidence and the circumstances. As I mentioned earlier, apart from Gacumbitsi going around instigating rapes on the 17th of April, he was involved as a leader in crimes in Rusumo commune. So, the Trial Chamber was entitled, in assessing the witness credibility, also to take this into account. So, it wasn't that Gacumbitsi only instigated rapes on a given day, but he was involved on another occasions, and as a leader, in a similar criminality. So the Trial Chamber was only reasonable to conclude that, given all these circumstances, given all the evidence examined holistically, Witness THU was a credible witness; she recognised Gacumbitsi's voice on that particular day. Your Honours, I will now turn to the third complaint, namely, that the Prosecutor failed to demonstrate that Gacumbitsi's instigation and the rapes were connected. That there was no nexus between the two, the instigations and the rapes. Your Honours, it is established jurisprudence that for any mode of participation under Article 61, whether instigation or ordering, it is not required that the Prosecutor demonstrates that the crimes wouldn't have happened without the Accused's conduct. What is required, that the Prosecutor demonstrates that the Accused's conduct substantially contributed to the crimes. And this is established in a number of cases, a line of cases, including Kayishema, paragraph 1.9 to 8, Blaskic, paragraph 41 to 42, and Kordic, paragraph 32. So what is required that the Prosecutor demonstrates that an Accused's conduct -- in this case the instigation -- substantially contributed to the crimes; in this case, the rapes. Your Honours, the evidence on the record, as found by the Trial Chamber, showed, among other things, that following Gacumbitsi's instigation of rapes on 17th April, Witness THU and seven other women and girls were raped immediately. Besides that, these rapes took place within the same locality, that is Nyarubuye secteur, where Gacumbitsi instigated the rapes. Your Honours, Gacumbitsi instigated the rapes not in private. Gacumbitsi took a megaphone, in daylight, and directly instigated rapes. It's only reasonable -- only reasonable -- that, looking at the immediacy of the rapes in the same location, more or less within the same timeframe, the same day -- or the same timeframe, that Gacumbitsi's instigation must have substantially contributed to the rapes. Your Honours, it is also established jurisprudence of this Trial Chamber -- of this Appeals Chamber that an accused committing a crime, or an accused participating in a crime -- for instance, by instigation -- if he does so with the likelihood -- I mean, with the knowledge that the crimes would be committed -- I repeat this. If an accused participated in a crime with a knowledge of a substantial likelihood that crimes would be perpetrated, that accused will be assumed to have accepted the crimes. Your Honours, this is well established in a number of cases, including Kordic, Appeals Chamber decision, paragraph 32, and Blaskic, Appeals Chamber, paragraph 31 to 32. In the instant case, the Accused chose the most effective means of communication; direct, unambiguous instigation of rapes, and rapes took place in the vicinity, in the location, and in the timeframe. So it must be assumed, at a minimum, that he accepted the crimes. Because he must have known -- he must have known -- that by doing what he did, there was a substantial likelihood that rapes would be perpetrated in Rusumo. More so given his status in Rusumo. He was the bourgmestre, he was the highest authority in the commune. Everybody respected him, as the Trial Chamber found. So his instigation, the manner in which he perpetrated it, was such that rapes would occur, and they did occur. So, he must be taken to have accepted the rapes. Your Honour, I will now address the last complaint which the appellant raised. Namely, that as far as he was concerned, these rapes were not part of widespread or systematic attacks in Rusumo. Your Honour, before even I go into the evidence, the appellant does not demonstrate -- they do not even endeavour to explain why these rapes were not part of the widespread attacks in Rusumo commune, or in Rwanda in general. But, beyond that -- beyond that -- he doesn't address what he means, or what he conceives of attacks being part of widespread attacks. Your Honours, the Appeals Chamber jurisprudence of this Tribunal has established clearly that the notion "being part of attacks" does not mean that the crimes in question must have taken place amidst the main attack. Not at all. And Kunarac -- I don't know whether I'm pronouncing it correctly, Kunarac -- Appeals Chamber judgement, paragraph 100, explains clearly. Being part of attacks, or being part of the whole attack, doesn't mean that the attacks, or the rapes in question, took place amidst the broad attack. Your Honour, it is sufficient -- it is sufficient -- if those attacks are sufficiently, or adequately, connected to the broader attack. In fact, Kunarac explains that even in situations where an attack can take place before or after the broad attack. What needs to be shown is that the attack in question, like in this case the rape, was sufficiently connected to the main attack. Your Honours, the evidence adduced during trial, and which the Trial Chamber found unanimously to have been credible, is that there were attacks in Rusumo commune. Not only the rapes -- I will emphasise this. The attacks in the form of rapes were a part of other attacks of different forms, including killings. Because this doesn't require that this -- the attack in which the Accused participated must be the same as the broad attack. Attack is a broader -- attack is a broad notion. It includes acts of violence in different forms. So, the rapes in question were not merely isolated here. They were not random acts removed from the broad attacks in Rusumo. Not at all. the evidence patently demonstrated that, apart from the rapes that occurred in Nyarubuye secteur, which the Accused -- which the Accused instigated, there were other attacks in the commune. It is also important to note that Gacumbitsi was not only involved in instigating the rapes, he was also involved in these other broad attacks, including one of the most atrocious attacks on Nyarubuye parish which occurred on about 17 April. He was the leader of this attack in which so many people were killed. So, overall -- overall -- it cannot be submitted, as my learned friend has submitted, that it was not shown that the rapes of the Tutsi remain in which -- in which the Accused instigated were isolated instances, far removed from the broad attacks. Not at all. The evidence clearly shows that the rapes, as a form of attack, was part and parcel of other attacks in other forms, including killings. And the Accused was principally involved in these other attacks. So, there's no way he can assert that the rapes were apart, or removed, from these other attacks. To the contrary, they were part and parcel of those attacks. Your Honour, if you may allow me, I will briefly address other complaints which the appellant raised in this appeal brief, in relation to other witnesses: TAC, TAP, and TAO. In his returning brief, which runs from paragraphs 326 to 372, he makes several attacks. I must say, unsubstantiated attacks against several witnesses. Among others, he talks about Witness TAP. Gacumbitsi claims that the witness did not testify on the date indicated by the Prosecutor, and therefore she could have been coached. This appears in paragraph 336 of Gacumbitsi's brief. Your Honour, these kind of assertions, unsubstantiated assertions, cannot hold water before an Appeals Chamber. Neither can they hold any weight before the Appeals Chamber. If an applicant, or an Accused, wants to talk about coaching witnesses -- which is wrong, okay, which is a crime -- he should prove -- he should adduce cogent evidence, other than merely making a general or sweeping statement that because the witness didn't come on the named day, he must have been coached. That is unacceptable. Your Honours, in paragraph 339 of his brief, he asserts that the witness claimed that, as she was being raped, the rapist told her that the rapist's father had appreciated the witness. Something, I must say, a little bit ambiguous. It's not clear what relevance it is to a crime against humanity -- rape -- if a rapist had some motives, whatever they are, in the course of raping. See, material on <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> jurisprudence that motives, or external objectives of crimes, are not defences to crimes. This is established clearly in several cases, including Tadic, and the Niyitigeka appeal judgement. So whether the rapist explained why she <stage>(sic)</stage> raped in that way is immaterial. What is important is a demonstration that the rapist raped following an instigation by the Accused, an instigation which substantially contributed to the rape. And Your Honour, I will demonstrate, in relation to our appeal, regarding the rapes testified to by Witness TAP, another witness, as with TAO and TAS, it was established that where, following Gacumbitsi's instigation, or because of Gacumbitsi's instigation, many women were raped, including TAP. Your Honour, in relation to Witness TAS, again the appellant makes several assertions, including that the witness didn't hear the Accused incite anyone to rape Tutsis. That's Witness TAS. Your Honour, it's immaterial if a victim has not heard about an accused instigating. What matters, as we show -- as we demonstrated, is that the perpetrators had -- or, that the perpetrators raped because the Accused instigated them to rape. So it's immaterial whether the victims didn't hear. So, whether or not TAS didn't hear the Accused instigate is immaterial. What is material is that those who raped Witness TAS -- or those who raped Witness TAS did so following Gacumbitsi's instigation, or that Gacumbitsi's instigation substantially contributed to their raping Witness TAS. Furthermore, again in relation to Witness TAS, the Accused claims that -- that's paragraph 348 of his brief -- 348 of his brief -- that those who raped TAS, or <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> Witness TAS was Gacumbitsi's cousin. Again, it is immaterial who raped this witness, as long as, as I said, it can be shown that the one who raped, whether it's a cousin of Gacumbitsi or not, did so following Gacumbitsi's instigation. So the relationship of the rapist is grossly immaterial. Again, in relation to paragraph -- to Witness TAS, that's paragraph 349, Gacumbitsi claims that Witness TAS exaggerated -- or that there was an exaggeration of Gacumbitsi's participation. It was a blatant scheme against -- there was a blatant scheme against the Accused. Again, this is <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> without any supporting material, and therefore I pray that the Appeals Chamber ignore -- dismisses such an assertion -- asserted claims. Finally, again, because it is a general -- these are general allegations, and there is quite a number, they are not supported at all. In relation to Witness TAO, the appellant claims that TAO testified about the rape of his wife to further, or to advance the Prosecutor's case. It's not clear what he means by -- I mean, by a witness testifying to advance the Prosecutor's case. It's not clear to me. I think witnesses are called to give evidence for a party. As long as they testify honestly, there's no question <stage>(sic)</stage> why their testifying for a particular party should be put into question. In relation to the same witness, the appellant claims that the witness wouldn't have forgotten the dates -- or the date when his wife was raped; this must be wrong, this must be speculation. Your Honours, I think the Trial Chamber and Appeals Chamber are aware that you should take into account the passage of time. Such specific details as the date when the instance took place, specific date, are material, no question. But then we should -- the Chambers take into account the passage of time. So, a witness cannot be held to be unreliable because he has forgotten that date when a certain crime was committed. In this case the witness gave an estimation, very reasonable, he explained how the conseiller first raped the witness <stage>(sic)</stage> for some days, and then the day -- the fateful day when the witness' wife was actually killed. So, the witness gave an account which was reasonable, and it's not demonstrated by appellant that Witness THU was unreasonable, was not credible, and they shouldn't be believed. I'm going to wind up, Your Honours. The Prosecution's case is this: Regarding the rapes, especially the rapes to which Witness THU testified -- because the other rapes are subject to another ground of appeal by us -- Your Honour, the Trial Chamber reached a number of conclusions, the evidence before which was assessed carefully. The Trial Chamber took into account pertinent considerations, especially regarding Witness THU's prior knowledge of the appellant, or -- it took into account this prior knowledge to find that she heard Gacumbitsi instigate rapes. It also took into account the context of the examination. It examined the total of the evidence, as opposed to looking at the instigation in isolation, and it found that Gacumbitsi instigated the rapes. Apparently the Trial Chamber, also applying the law, it found that the rapes to which Gacumbitsi -- which Gacumbitsi instigated followed, or resulted from, his instigation. Although, as we shall submit in our ground of appeal, what we require is a demonstration that the rapes -- that the Accused's instigation contributed substantially to the rapes. Not a cause-effect relationship. But with regards to Witness THU, after even a heightened threshold, cause-effect <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> was demonstrated. The law is an accused instigates, and crimes are committed, because of -- I mean, his contribution, or his participation, contributes substantially to the crimes. That was demonstrated by the evidence adduced by THU. And finally, regarding the rapes being part of widespread attacks, Your Honour, the evidence of the record is sufficient; that these rapes were not merely isolated incidents, they were part and parcel, widespread or systematic attacks, in the commune and in Rwanda in general, attacks in which the Accused was principally involved. He led the attacks, so he cannot plead that these rapes were separate, or were far removed from these attacks. Unless I have -- I may be of any help, Your Honours, I rest my submissions. </p>

            <p>This morning we have received an urgent motion by the Accused for the admission of the statements presented by the Prosecutor -- that motion has been made under Rule 115 -- having regard to the urgencies of the case. I propose that we should dispense with the usual procedures under which the Prosecution would be entitled to some time to respond to the motion, and we can regard the Prosecution's response as set out in its notice relating to the two statements concerned. If that is agreeable, then we would defer a decision until later in the day, subject to any argument that the parties may wish to make now.</p>

            <p>Thank you, President. I have a question for the Prosecution. You will recall that my learned colleague, Judge Schomburg, yesterday asked a question, I believe, directed to the Defence with regard to paragraph 12 of the indictment. You might want to have that part of that in front of you. And here is my question: As I read the judgement, am I correct in my understanding that the convictions for committing -- I emphasise committing -- extermination and genocide rests exclusively on the killing of Mr. Murefu. Let me make it clear that I'm not suggesting that this will necessarily affect the finding by the Trial Chamber that Mr. Gacumbitsi was guilty of genocide and of extermination pursuant to other Article 6, paragraph 1, liability. Now, if my understanding is correct, do tell us, Counsel, how could the Defence not have been prejudiced by the fact that this killing was never mentioned in the indictment? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Subject to further cross-checking, especially with regard to the basis upon which the various convictions were specifically placed, because the judgement is a little bit big, I would only submit on two points. Your Honours, I mainly focus on the pleading in paragraph 12, which you actually want me to submit on, and I'll be summing that this paragraph that was pleaded does not intend, or was not intended, to actually rely on any specific matter in the context of the genocide. This indication was clearly underscored by the word "use" including, when it came to mentioning the victims, it uses the phrase "among other victims." This phrase, Your Honour, means that the intention of that paragraph was merely to alert and inform the Accused that in pleading the term of genocide, extermination, that Prosecutor intends to rely on any specific matter, particularly given the fact that these crimes, by their very nature, will, particularly in the country of Rwanda, involved massive killings. So the phrase used here did not, in any way, provide any kind of misinformation. It informs the Defence, well, there were many killings here, whether Murefu or others. Murefu is mentioned here but there were many killings here, including the victims here mentioned. So, to that extent, regardless of whether Murefu was specifically mentioned, there was no prejudice because the Defence was not invited by this paragraph to go even to investigate specific killings, in a sense, because the words used were "among other victims." Therefore "among other victims", some of these were mentioned, implying that the Defence was not called upon, in a sense, and I said "in a sense" to go and investigate specific killings. If, Your Honours, we were pleading this paragraph in the context of crimes like -- crimes like <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> murder, and was saying, "Well, the Accused killed a specific individual." Your Honour, we would have caused the prejudice if, at the time of events during the proceedings, we came out with a different matter altogether. That would have been a prejudice. I would want Your Honour to rely on the jurisprudence of this Tribunal with respect to the crime of extermination, and I specifically want to rely on the decision in Ntakirutimana. Your Honour, in that decision we are -- the Prosecutor appealed contesting the Trial Chamber's finding that in pleading examination <stage>(sic)</stage> the Prosecutor was bound to specify the victims, in terms of names and the particulars. Your Honour, the Appeals Chamber held that with regard to the term of "exterminaton" the Prosecutor is not bound to spell out the particulars of those victims, given, among other factors, the nature of this crime. This crime targets civilian populations. As long as the Prosecutor spells out, in general terms, that the victims that were targeted were a civilian population, that will suffice, without requiring the Prosecutor to spell out further details in terms of names, in terms of particulars of identity. It suffices if the Prosecutor gives, in general terms, the nature of the victims, namely a civilian population. Your Honour, although this decision is in the context of extermination, I submit it applies equally to the crime of genocide and I would submit that it would fit within the parameters of paragraph 12 of the indictment, which did not seek to inform the Accused that the Prosecutor was relying on any specific victim -- on any specific victim of the genocide. This intention was to inform the Defence that there were many victims killed, victims belonging to the Tutsi population. So, whatever name comes out of the victim, including Murefu and others, Your Honours, the Accused was notified. And if I may add, Your Honour, given more time, with Your Honourships <stage>(sic),</stage> we will give further cross-check, especially in terms of further notices that were given in the preferred brief, among others, further informing the Defence that the Prosecutor does not intend to rely on the paragraph -- I mean, on the bit of paragraph 12, to rely on that specific killing. But, again, other notice, to inform the Defence that, well, this murder was committed against a huge number of victims, and this list, which was given, was not exhaustive. So there was no need for this information, whatsoever, regarding --</p>

          <sp who="#judge-meron">
            <speaker>JUDGE MERON:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, I have some little problems here, I must say. The question that I asked you was not with regard to possible other forms of liability under Article 6 paragraph 1 with regard to genocide and extermination. My question was specifically related to the finding in the judgement that the Accused committed, was responsible for committing certain crimes, committing, himself, certain crimes. Now, you are telling us, if I understand, that the fact that paragraph 12 of the indictment uses the word "among them" - "among them," that this gives the Accused Article 8 notice that he has been notified to use the word "notify," how would that fit with the doctrine of the Tribunal regarding the need to contain adequate pleadings in the indictment so that the Accused can prepare his Defence? If you are not quite ready to give us all the aspects of that question, I don't mind if you come back to it after checking the record further, but I have problems here. Inter alia, why not write all the time in the indictment inter alia and say, "We have given adequate notification." That concludes my question.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, again subject to further submissions I may make, I also want to draw your attention, in addition to paragraph 12, the immediate following paragraph -- I beg your pardon -- if you can refer to the judgement, paragraph 288, and another page subject to further submissions after further cross-checking. The basis upon which these convictions of Gacumbitsi were grounded were planning, instigation, ordering -- and ordering an <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> committing, plus aiding and abetting the killings of the Tutsi population. That's a broader basis. But maybe, specifically, what was your question about the necessity of pleading the killing of the specific individual? I would make my submission on this, maybe, subsequently, but I would still submit that the paragraph 12, really, the way it stands, issues of terms "among others" would -- I mean, mind you, it didn't cause any confusion. But, as I said, in terms of further submissions, I make submissions whether we really needed to spell it out, but I still believe that we didn't need to because the theory of the Prosecutor's case was quite clear, that we were not relying on any specific victim having been killed and our intention was, from paragraph 12, to inform the Defence that his genocide and extermination count was based on his involvement in the massive killing of so many victims, among which those ones named in paragraph 12. So, our case for submissions on that, I would still maintain the position that that paragraph adequately covered the victim in this case, Murefu, who was shot dead, among the many victims that were involved in this massive killing. I would like to mention that I may make my submission on your needs, but that's the position of the Prosecutor.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Counsel, I'm extremely grateful that you finally came back to count 1 and count 2, that is genocide and complicity in genocide, as pleaded in the indictment, and not referring to the jurisprudence on extermination. Mainly, this would lead to different results. Can -- did I take your arguments correctly in that you are saying that, as we all know, genocide, the crime of crimes, consists predominantly on the mens rea, the specific intent and the specific intent to kill, or other alternatives mentioned in Article 2, a targeted group and not individuals. So, is it your point that the last four lines of paragraph 12 are only of additional assistance when you say, in the beginning of these four lines, "among them" and concluding with "among others" that, from your point of view, the crime of genocide or complicity in genocide would have been pleaded with the sufficient preciseness, even without mentioning any name, because the target is not the individual but the group. Did I get your point correctly? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>I would say, Your Honour, that's the position. As Your Honour pointed out, the crime of genocide targets groups. Individuals are victimised not because of their individual personalities, but because of their membership in the groups being targeted. So, even without mentioning the names in further -- even if we do not mention the names, and we had just merely pleaded that the accused was involved in the perpetuation of killing, targeting a civilian population at Nyarubuye parish and other scenes, that would have been sufficient, without even naming the names, without giving the names, without giving the specific names, that would have sufficed, Your Honour, because what transits <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> a killing of an individual, in terms of genocide, is the targeting of the individual as a member of the group. The group becomes the victim of the crime. So even the mere meeting, Your Honour, I would submit, that the Accused was involved in perpetrating crimes against a group of individuals because of their Tutsi identity would have been sufficient.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Counsel, could you please tell me if appellant Gacumbitsi was able to establish that their Defence was compromised by the defects in the indictment? If the answer is yes, if the conviction is for genocide, does it stand on the basis of other facts which can be inferenced from other facts in the case?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, even presuming there was prejudice, which we submit really never existed, our decision would stand on the basis of other facts. Your Honour, as the record shows, the Accused was involved not only at Nyarubuye but in other locations. And even more so when it comes to Nyarubuye parish, Your Honour, his involvement -- his involvement may be the mere killing of Murefu. When he killed Murefu he called upon -- it was a signal for others to take action. Even for Nyarubuye alone -- the massacre at Nyarubuye parish alone, even if we had put apart the killing of Murefu, which we submit, Your Honours, that it should remain, to use the genocide conviction <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> could be grounded on that Nyarubuye parish incident because his killing of Murefu was a signal. It set in motion a commencement of massive killing, and based on his action at Nyarubuye, Your Honour, the Accused was found culpable besides committing the killing of Murefu. He was correctly found for ordering the communal police to kill the victims at Nyarubuye parish and, actually, commit -- further in our appeal he's ordering actually persons beyond the communal policemen, because there were other perpetrators, Interahamwe, civilians. So, if I may summarise, Your Honour, in answer to your question, even assuming the Defence were to plead prejudice in the context of the killing of Murefu, the committing of genocide based on Murefu, genocide commission still stands totally on the basis of the Nyarubuye killings, on the basis of other killings. So the killings -- the killing of Murefu was a signal. So his killing of Murefu was a signal. It was closely interpreted, also, because the killing was construed, in addition to the words that he used that, "Well, now take weapons." The committing alone, the ordering came and took place and the instigation came and took place within the same circumstances at Nyarubuye, besides other massacres scenes which were involved. So the commission would still stand, Your Honours.</p>

            <p>Sorry, Counsel, but the events of this matter is important enough to insist on clarification. First let me point out that my question did not deal with mens rea but on the <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> strengths. Secondly, I really defer to the point made by my distinguished colleague, Judge Güney, even without more Murefu other forms of liability, criminal liability, under Article 61. My question was very specific, it related to the word in Article 61, "committed." Now, for committing you need something additional, and if you look at the judgement, for example, the judgement tells us in Article 259, "moreover the Accused personally killed Murefu." In paragraph 261, in particular, the Chamber found the Accused killed Murefu, so given the problem of articulation, proper pleading of paragraph 12 does presence a problem, at least for me.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>May I briefly add or make my submission on this. Your Honour, we have knowledge that the jurisprudence of the Tribunal insists that when you allege personal commission you should spell out the identities of the victims, personal commission. Of course the jurisprudence has exceptions; for instance, when there's a massiveness of crimes, or when it is alleged that the Accused was involved in a continuous policy of criminality or a systematic crime, the level of specificity may be lower or is lower and the <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> holds that, well, if the petitioner comes hand in hand with the information, we can provide it, evaluate it, when he obtains it. Paragraph 12 of the indictment does not, as I said, intend to talk about personal commission, as to demand a high tentative level of specificity. It does not. Paragraph 12 does not intend, and it is explicit. It was intended to provide a mode of participation, you know, over an Accused in a massive killing, providing some specificities in terms of "among others" by using the term "among others," but is not intended to focus on the personal commission that Gacumbitsi killed X, Y, or Z. So, notwithstanding the requirement that where personal commission is the focus, which was not the case here, we would submit that paragraph 12, really, <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> is included in paragraph 12 or "other victims" among others Murefu included. So this doesn't intend <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> to talk about personal commission in strictly speaking. It was unintentional to allege the Accused, that you are not being charged with specificity. We are not charging you for specifically committing a specific murder. We are charging you for committing massive murders. And in that context, Your Honour, the level of specificity is lower, the level of specificity is lower.</p>

And another question is that whether the murder of the Mr. Murefu is charged with the murder of killing or it is pleaded in relation to the commission of the genocide. Thank you.</p>

We pleaded, in paragraph 12, the fact that the Accused was involved in a massive killing of many victims and so regardless -- and this is my submission -- regardless of any subsequent communication -- I'll collect communication in a moment -- regardless of any communication that came subsequently, paragraph 12 adequately covered many victims -- including Murefu -- but many other victims and the Accused was adequately informed of this fact, not to go out an investigate Murefu, not to go out an investigate specific individuals. The intention was clear. You were responsible for massive killings of victims. We are not charging you for a specific murder. We are charging you with a massive killing of many victims.</p>

Now, I'm sure that -- I suspect my colleagues would like to know in what was the Accused given the kind of notice that would have allowed him to prepare a Defence due to the indictment statement that he killed persons, plural, no identification, no names, by his own hand, and paragraph 12 cites names and says, inter alia, and Murefu is not mentioned there? </p>

You appreciate that on a seeking of an indictment, worded in the way in which this indictment was worded, the Defence, as your good counsel, you could be a Defence counsel, would have had to investigate whereas there was a killing of any or all of these 12 people? </p>

            <p>We are cognisant, Your Honour, about that reality, but there is no question about that in a sense, that names haven't been given. It is unreasonable that a party would, maybe at a certain point, investigate those names. However, the paragraph -- I mean the pleading, as it is expressly pleaded, does not also, on the other hand, seeks the hand of the Defence to those other murders. So, beside those specific murders, the indictment invited the Defence to investigate broadly, because the intention was of the <stage>(Unintelligible)</stage> was not limited to set up those specific murders, but it was intended to go beyond them.</p>

            <p>Then you would say, would you, that it is for the Appeals Chamber to consider whether, on the findings made by the Trial Chamber, that the committing of genocide had a meaning wider than the linkage to the death of Murefu would suggest. You would turn to paragraph 2 -- you would turn to the paragraph in which you were -- "committing" was mentioned, and you would link that to paragraph 168 to 178 in which the Trial Chamber finds that the Accused directed and personally engaged in the attacks, which resulted in these deaths, and would that be a way of saying that the Appeals Chamber should, therefore, find that he committed genocide in all of these ways? Would I be correct in understanding your position that way? In paragraph 288 you said, "In the light of the foregoing, that has to do with the Accused directing these attacks and personally engaging in them, which the Trial Chamber found -- in the light of that the Trial Chamber find that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was responsible for planning, instigating, ordering the communal police committing and aiding and abetting in the killing of members of the Tutsi ethnic group." Is that your way of looking at it? </p>

            <p>Well, I submit, therefore, Judge, is broad in a sense, all inclusive in that context. And maybe I will also add that actually some <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> in our comment -- grounds, acts of committing were involved, not only personal commission but also commission in terms of joint enterprise. But, besides that, Your Honour, the broadness of the prosecution of the Accused, actually is, as I must say, you're pointing out that was crucially found by Trial Chamber. It was not <stage>(unintelligible),</stage> it was much broader, and it emanated from the Accused's conduct at the scene of the crime, Nyarubuye, but when we came to the Nyarubuye parish, his involvement actually brings into play a broad range of multiple participation.</p>

            <p>Sorry, Counsel, but apparently we get lost in discussing this point, but the further we go into details, I think, the more questions arise. In the beginning of Roman <stage>(iii),</stage> when you plead count 1 or alternatively count 2, it reads, "Pursuant to Article 61 of the statute," by virtue of this affirmative act in ordering seems surprisingly enough instead of "incitement to commit," it reads, "Instigating, commanding." I don't know where this language stems from. In any event, it's not in Article 2 - "participating in aiding and abetting." And the same is true for complicity in genocide. It also is pleaded "instigating, commanding, participating, and aiding and abetting," but nowhere the word "committing" appears.</p>

          <sp who="#judge-schomburg">

            <speaker>JUDGE SCHOMBURG:</speaker>
            <p>It's a follow-up question into the actus reus where we departed this morning by the question from my distinguished colleague, Judge Meron, when he asked you the question on the actus reus and there whether it amounts to "committing" or, when you read correctly, jurisprudence on genocide of the Tribunal, for example, in the Tribunal in the case of Kupreskic or Ntakirutimana that it could be qualified in another way. And I missed -- maybe you can help me out with this -- in the beginning of the pleading, already, the words "committing", and I would be interested in what is the basis for "commanding genocide." Maybe I'm absolutely wrong, but I can't see this mode of participation in Article 2, para 3 of the statute. Thank you.</p>

            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>I'll quickly go to the question. Regarding your first question, Your Honour, on the pleading, I was looking at the French version of the indictment, the paragraph you referred to, it includes the pleading that the Accused participated in the commission. I don't know whether the English volume may be different, but it talks about the Accused participating in the commission.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-schomburg">
            <speaker>JUDGE SCHOMBURG:</speaker>
            <p>In the English version it reads -- maybe it's another version: "Participating in aiding and abetting".</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Well, interestingly the French version says, "Participated in the commission and the aiding and abetting." Did I get your question, Your Honour, in relation to the French version? But also the judgement in paragraph 269 seems to explain it more -- 69 -- I wonder whether there was a problem of translation from French or from English to French, but accordingly, the big issue is commission. Could I move to another issue, Your Honour? Maybe I can provide further information in case I come by -- I mean I have my submission regarding the paragraph. Now, concerning the existence of "commanding" or the absence of "commanding" in the statute, Your Honour, this word was used. We have knowledge that commanding is not really mentioned in the statute, but, in terms of construction, the Trial Chamber correctly found that, although it is not available, not mentioned in the statute, ordering would be -- I mean it is covered, I mean it is covered in the context of ordering.</p>

            <p>And then finally maybe -- this is in relation to the question raised by the learned Judges Meron and others -- concerning and Judge Güney concerning whether there was an effort, in the sense of providing further particulars on the Murefu. I submit, Your Honours, that actually this was well done. The Prosecution, following the indictment, the Prosecution provided further particulars, particularly in the context of witness disclosure, in which the name of Murefu was contained and it was a statement of Witness TAQ. So there was a subsequent effort, Your Honours, to communicate the fact that Murefu would be one of the victims, among the many that the Prosecution intended to rely on, in establishing the culpability of -- we listed for genocide and extermination. And we are obliged to refer you to our brief, paragraph -- especially paragraph 152, 153, and the following paragraph, sir, but mainly 152 and 153 where we address the question of post-indictment communication in respect of the killing of Murefu.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE MERON:</speaker>
            <p>I'm very grateful to the President for drawing our attention to paragraph 288 of the judgement, which refers -- uses the word "in light of the foregoing," so the foregoing includes paragraph 285. Paragraph 285 defines "committed" and I read, "Committing refers generally to the direct and physical concentration of the crime by the offender himself, so in the present case the Accused came to Murefu, a Tutsi, the Chamber, therefore, finds that he committed crime of genocide within the meaning of Article 6 <stage>(1).</stage> " So to simplify things in this context, what you say about ordering or instigation is not relevant to the point, the narrow point I have asked. Now, regarding the indictment, again, at paragraph 4 of the indictment, which I cited before, speaks of Gacumbitsi killing persons by his own hands. Killing persons by his own hands means to me, in simple English, committing the killing. And, of course, a finding of the Trial Chamber supports this line of reasoning. Now, your last point was, if I understand correctly, that duty of the Prosecution to give proper notice to the Accused, even if not satisfied by the indictment, itself, may have been satisfied by the fact that Mr. Murefu's name is mentioned in a witness statement. Now, again, I'm a bit troubled by the -- does this mean that witness statements provided by the Prosecution, we should assume that the Prosecution is charging every potentially criminal act that described in each statement of a witness and what would this do to the well established jurisprudence of this Tribunal regarding the need to have adequate pleadings in the indictment? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Thanks, your Honour. The jurisprudence, which is established by the Tribunal, did allow for exceptions, where there is a failure to communicate. Your Honour, in the context of this indictment, especially reading it holistically, <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> there was an effort to communicate the fact that we are relying on a specific matter as such, we were relying on the broader <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> base concerning the nature of the crimes that the Accused was involved in. However, in terms of communication, I think that the <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> also allows, in some circumstances, communication to the Defence, including pre-trial brief and statement, can be important. In the context of this case, although arguably it may be put that not every aspect of the witness statement is material -- I mean immaterial; however, in this case, given the limited number of witness statements, and given the specificity with which Gacumbitsi's involvement in the murder <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> is mentioned, we would submit that this was adequate communication. If there had been a massive material -- and I think this arises from the Ntakirutimana judgement -- that there are cases of situations where the existence, for instance, of various statements referring to the same scene can cause confusion. And I think, in the case of Ntakirutimana, there were several situations where several situations were disclosed, yet they caused some confusion. In this case the disclosure was of a specific witness statement, specifically including the mention of Murefu and the Accused's involvement or the Accused's killing of this Murefu. So there was not such a massive disclosure of statement regarding the same event whereby the Accused was confused. The Accused was put on specific notice, and this notice was conveyed in a specific statement. There were no other statements that were conveying confusing information. So, in this context, we submit that this communication was an adequate cure. It didn't cause any confusion, but it clarified the matter of commission that his involvement in the commission of the killing of Murefu.</p>

            <p>Could I ask you to confirm something to me, and the first thing is that you have hunted out that the French translation of the indictment was not the same as the English text, so, could you tell me whether, as you understand it, the Accused would have been presented with a French translation and whether he would have been dealing with a matter in the French language? The second question -- well, I put that one first. Judge Schomburg has pointed out that I was in error in speaking of the French translation. It should have been the original in French.</p>

There was subsequent communication of the material, the witness statement. And, finally, the Accused actually does not contest it in his appeals brief or in the notice of appeal in the appeals brief, Your Honour, so that should be considered, given the circumstances which have been addressed, Your Honour, I think our question is that we conveyed -- we communicated adequately the pleading, I mean the allegation.</p>

            <p>Good morning, Your Honours. In our response I wanted to deal with the appellant challenges to some interlocutory decisions the Trial Chamber has taken in this case. The appellant is challenging six interlocutory decisions and he, in fact, referred to these decisions very briefly yesterday during our submission. Now, we have addressed the form in which the appellant has presented his appeals and the merits of his appeal in our brief, and I was not going to go into the details today. What I just wanted to make clear to you today was that I wanted to go back to the essence of his appeal. And the essence is, was the Trial Chamber wrong in issuing these decisions? Now, our submission is that the Trial Chamber was not, and that the Trial Chamber had the responsibility of managing executive procedure, dealing with the pre-trial and the trial issues of the case in order to ensure that the appellant received a fair and expeditious trial. Now, our submission is that the Trial Chamber did that in a fair and reasonable way. Reasonably with respect to the application of the law and reasonably with respect to the ability of the Accused to make full answer in Defence. My intention was to lead Your Honours to each of the decisions, just to point out that the Trial Chamber is, in effect, ensured a balance. I don't know whether, with the time constraint, whether you still want me to do that, but I'm always willing to ask <stage>(sic)</stage> any additional questions which you my have in addition to the submissions to be made in our brief.</p>

            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Your Honour. My submissions are simply this. The Prosecution relies on the matters contained in its brief regarding the sentence ground. It is our submission that a 30 years sentence for the crimes of which the appellant was convicted is not only a sentence within the permissible range but it is, in fact, regarding the jurisprudence of this Tribunal, a lenient sentence. This Chamber, of course, may only intervene if there is some discernible error is shown or demonstrated by the appellant in the sentencing exercise. It is our submission that there has been no such error demonstrated by the appellant. All of the matters which were canvassed yesterday by the appellant -- well, most of them were considered, that is the appellant's previous good character and his family situation. Consideration was given to those matters by the Trial Chamber; there was no error shown in their approach. With regard to some of the other matters which were raised, such as the age of the appellant and the average life expectancy of a person in Africa, personally we submit there is nothing exceptional about the age of this appellant. He is roughly the same age of most other persons that have been convicted by this Tribunal of the crimes of genocide and extermination. Secondly, with regard to the issue of possible life expectancy, that is simply irrelevant, in our submission. Unless there is any further assistance we can give to the Court on that point, I have no further submissions on the sentence aspect. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Your Honours. The Defence of the Accused is somewhat handicapped in its address to the Chamber for the simple reason that I have filed a motion and the Chamber is still to deliberate on that. However, what I said yesterday, Your Honours, regarding the Accused, Gacumbitsi, concerning the crimes alleged, remain entirely as I said them. I would respectfully request that the Prosecutor, who knows what he will be doing this afternoon -- and let me tell you why, because in the words that they stopped me from using yesterday, not the word, it was second, he admitted that his indictment is not precise. I do respect the sanctity of the Office of the Prosecutor, when it is told, did he commit -- it says he participated. Is that correct? But, in my view, the Accused can't commit the incitement, can't commit rape, but when it is said that he committed murder, that means he killed, and in the indictment, paragraph 4, "personally killed or in his own hands," I heard the Prosecutor state -- and he fought with a lot of finesse I must admit, because I was expecting better than that regarding the interruptions yesterday -- but, you see, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Accused never asked that he be told, whatsoever, in the indictment regarding crimes against humanity, genocide and extermination, it would be sufficient that a single individual be killed -- and I said this yesterday -- for the crime to be characterised in its definition as provided by the text. Now, this is a problem that the Prosecutor will be faced with. And I mentioned this problem before the Chamber, even if I do not have the time, please refer to what I said in my text. At paragraph 12 - or, in the judgement it is said that Murefu was killed, that the Accused kill Murefu. It was regarding genocide and extermination, crimes against humanity; the list or the addresses of persons killed is not provided. The question which the Appeals Chamber needs to ask, and which I submitted to the Trial Chamber, is when the Prosecutor claims that the 12 persons in paragraph 12 were killed by Gacumbitsi, how can you get to know that these people were Tutsis? How can you know that Murefu is a Tutsi? Because only one person is killed, does that mean genocide? This is, provided that he is a member of the target group, the religious, national group, that was targeted. The least of things in such circumstances -- and this is quite clear in your jurisdiction, I don't need to go back into this -- I've heard that this Tribunal has been qualified as shameful because its job is not well done. The indictment against Gacumbitsi, and I'm saying this looking you in the eye, my dear colleagues -- tell me which is the prejudice that an Accused can be faced with for having killed 14 people? What is the role of the Defence, when you claim in the English or in French, when you say investigate, what does that mean for us, what is our job in that instance? We would have preferred -- apart from an identity card, which would be excessive -- but we would have wished that the Prosecutor prove, at least, the fact that those who are mentioned are members of the targeted group. And that was not the case. And you will find this nowhere, Your Honours, I plead. The Prosecutor, in his conclusion, in his brief, said that the appellant did not suffer any prejudice, I believe it's paragraph 20 and 52. He did not make any objection regarding Murefu. Your Honours, I would wish that the Prosecutor reads what I write, and he should read this from paragraph 214 to 220. That is my principal criticism, and any reasonable Judge would not accept taking into consideration Murefu as the basis for the criminal character of Gacumbitsi. I've heard from the other side across the floor. I've heard it said by my colleagues, my learned friends who took four years to prepare the allegations against the Accused, that there were other targets. That is not my role. They are the ones who prepared the indictment, and they are the ones to provide evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. They need to tell us exactly what happened in Rusumo, Your Honours. There is nothing said in that regard. Genocide cannot be defined by a specific crime. I do admit and I believe that this is the essence of genocide, but when you look at 285, paragraph 161 of the judgement, they say that it is said that Gacumbitsi killed Murefu as a signal for the others to go into the commission of a crime. Murefu is mentioned, but there is no evidence to suggest that Murefu, if he did indeed exist, was indeed a Tutsi, and even in the indictment nothing proved that these people were Tutsi. And the Prosecutor will be unable to prove this to you. The Prosecutor will claim that Murefu was part of a wider investigation, but the Prosecutor has not proved -- has not provided any evidence to that effect. I have to come back to this issue. It's the fact that Murefu was killed, or allegedly was killed on the 15th of April. Now, the 15th of April Gacumbitsi was taken to the parish of Nyarubuye by Sebudandi. And you have the disclosure made by the Prosecution, whereas in 1994 Sebudandi was no longer a driver of the commune. He had already been fired in 1992. So these are things which are sufficiently pertinent and relevant and which caused defect to the indictment, and the Chamber, in its embarrassment, had to substitute the only name that it was provided with, mainly, Murefu. Where does this name come from, Mr. Prosecutor? I said this yesterday, and I would like to repeat, the jurisprudence is applicable only when there is no evidence, and the law states that the indictment must be precise. Please, do not mention the names of victims. There's no problem. But as soon as you do it, you have to be precise, so that the Accused can be aware of what the allegations are. Mr. Prosecutor, did you at least, in one instance, say where Murefu lived, what commune? And you've had the sentence of 30 years and you believe that life expectancy is a joke. And I don't think that it is a joke. What I would like to say is that I have not been informed of the other sites of genocide. Learned friends, Gacumbitsi was alone in Rusumo and the only crime that was committed has been viewed to -- related to genocide, to rape and all the events that occurred in Nyarubuye parish between the 15th and the 20th of April, whereas my client was in hiding. Honourable Judges, in your deliberation, if you are to find a paragraph through which the Chamber has rejected my client's alibi, please let me know. But if that is not the case, the Prosecutor cannot impose its own will on the decisions already rendered by the Trial Chamber. </p>

            <p>We said, in our alibi, that the Accused was not there, and I repeated this in my submissions yesterday, Your Honours. Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi's case -- unless you believe otherwise -- depends specifically on the events which took place in Nyarubuye. And as regards for killings, for murder, for extermination of a target population, the Prosecutor claims that there were other sites, apart from Nyarubuye. I have noticed, Your Honours -- and I would like to conclude on that note -- that in the reply to my brief, the Prosecutor, regarding sentence, did not dare to mention what I said yesterday. When you look at the judgment before you, you will see that the most serious aggravated circumstances of Gacumbitsi at the time of the events was bourgmestre. That was his position. Thank you, Mr. President. I was saying, Mr. President that the aggravating circumstances was that Gacumbitsi was bourgmestre. Yesterday, in replying to my brief, he mentioned two of his witnesses, TAB <stage>(sic)</stage> and TBH. TBH ********************** secteur. He killed five people. He committed genocide. He admitted in writed <stage>(sic)</stage> to these commission -- to these offences and he was sentenced. TBI also committed crimes, and he has been brought before the courts in Rwanda.

            <p>Yes, I was saying, Your Honours, that TBH led the killings, and he admitted to killing five people, and this was in Kagina <stage>(phonetic)</stage> secteur. And TBI, in Kigarama secteur, admitted the facts, and they were prosecuted in Rwanda. Now, one had 15 years, and the other 11. So, in total that was 26 years. Gacumbitsi, who was not seen at the parish, was sentenced to 30 years. And it is alleged that merely by the fact of being bourgmestre is sufficient for that to be mentioned as an aggravating circumstance.

            <p>Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, Your Honours I am convinced of one thing, and I am submitting that thing to you. If, in this case, in this trial, you will remove Murefu, if you remove Nyarubuye as a site, the Prosecutor will have all the difficulties in the world to mention the commission of any crime. Because TAW, its star witness, left Rwanda on the 13th of April, and he stated before the Chamber -- and this is in my book of the appellant -- there was no burnt-down houses, and he never killed -- "And I never saw Gacumbitsi kill by his own hand." Yesterday, the Prosecutor stated that counsel for the Accused is mentioning the fact that the Prosecutor has manipulated witnesses. Dear colleagues, the Prosecutor, I didn't say anything; it's your witness, TBH, who made those statements. The Prosecutor said in Court on the 20th August that he received a document by diplomatic pouch on Saturday, and he looked for me everywhere. But when the witness appeared on Monday, he said that I discussed this document with the Prosecutor on Friday, and he believed that it wasn't done properly, and we needed to review it. This is a document which appeared, and this was a time when the witness claimed that there was distribution of weapons. It's in the transcripts. The Prosecutor did that, and that's what the witness said. I hope that when the Prosecutor mentioned this witness, he should maybe not <stage>(sic)</stage> have asked that -- the Chamber for a moment of silence, because I do not believe that that gentleman is still alive. He did not live for more than one month. These are facts, Mr. President, Your Honours, which I'm submitting to you for appreciation. TBH did what no other witness did, and in full view of the Court. More than four pages he repeated the same question <stage>(sic),</stage> and he said over and over again that, "I never did so." Yesterday I heard it said that he was not corroborated. Now, Mr. Prosecutor, instead of relying on the fact that my client came to you, you are depending on doctrine. Now, I'm telling my colleague, and my colleague says that I am the one that gave her the document. I said to the Chamber I had never seen this document, and then they mentioned to me corroboration. All that we have said with regard to evidence is true, and from this moment nobody has proved this to the contrary. All that they want you to believe is that this is jurisprudence. That's the theory. And I'm saying, let's apply those -- that jurisprudence and those facts to -- and those doctrines to the fact. This has not been done, and we have not been provided with that information, and we believe that our appeal is well-founded, and we believe you should consider it fully. I thank you, Your Honours. </p>

            <speaker>MR. STEWART:</speaker>
            <p>Now, first of all, I want, as a matter of putting this on the record, to say that we regret that the two statements that have been disclosed to the Defence were not disclosed before the trial. They were within the possession of the Prosecution, I believe, by April of 2003, if I'm not mistaken, and the trial began in July of 2003. Insofar as we're able to determine it was an unfortunate oversight, but it's one that we regret, and we recognise that we have to improve our performance, even at this level, because although we did make the disclosure, as we should have done, we did so so late that clearly it has perturbed, to some degree, the hearing of the appeal. And so I regret that, and I apologise for it on behalf of the Office of the Prosecutor. When the disclosure was made we filed a document, and I'm simply going to adopt the two arguments made in that document as two of the arguments in response to the motion you have this morning. And I needn't go into detail with respect to those arguments. The first one is that the information contained in the statements is of a purely hearsay nature, with respect to the meetings designed to sensitise the population against killing, and in relation to the arrests. These two individuals are reporting information that they have received from other people. The one individual who speaks about meetings says, in the next breath, that he never attended any of the meetings. So we take the position that it's rank hearsay. We also have taken the position, and provided you in the filing document, if I can call it that, with specific references to the trial record that there was indeed better evidence, if you will, before the Trial Chamber in relation to these same incidents. And in the end result the Trial Chamber, having considered that evidence, found that it did not detract from the cogent Prosecution evidence it had heard, and upon which it based its conclusions. So, our submission is that, given the hearsay nature of the material, and the treatment of even better evidence by the Trial Chamber, this material, this information, this evidence, if you will, could not have had a decisive impact on the verdict, and therefore is not admissible under Rule 115. My friend has raised a third point which we, of course, did not anticipate, and have not responded to, if you will, in anticipation, in the filing document. And I would like to address that point briefly now, but in order to do so I have to make reference to closed-session transcript. So, if we could have just a couple of minutes of closed session, I would be grateful, Mr. President. </p>

            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, by way of overview, there are six grounds of appeal pleaded by the Prosecution. The Prosecution will address oral argument on each of those six grounds, which obviously means that we will need to be quite succinct in our submissions. The appeal Chamber, of course, does have the benefit of an extensive written brief on all six grounds. I -- if I may set out the order in which the grounds will be argued. They do not correspond entirely to the order in which they appear in the notice of appeal. That is not done in any way to confuse anyone, but merely because -- to present a more coherent account. The first ground you will hear oral argument on is ground 2, the ground pertaining to murder as a crime against humanity. I will address the Court upon that ground. My colleague, Dr. Mugwanya, will then address the Court on grounds 3 and 6, that is, the ground of rape as a crime against humanity, and the ground regarding the liability of the appellant for ordering. Ms. Onsea will then address the Court on ground 5, that is, the ground where we say the Trial Chamber erred in law in not considering joint criminal enterprise. I'm sorry, I have that out of order. Before you hear from Ms. Onsea, Mr. Stewart will address the Court on the ground concerning the Trial Chamber's definition of the elements of the crime of rape as a crime against humanity. Ms. Onsea will then address the Court on the ground concerning the Trial Chamber's error in not considering joint criminal enterprise. And finally I will address the Court on the first ground of appeal, that is, the sentence appeal lodged by the Prosecution. By way of overview, the arguments are these: Firstly, with regard to the ground concerning murder as a crime against humanity, our argument is essentially that the Trial Chamber erred in fact, as well as law, in not considering all relevant supporting evidence. With regard to ground 3, the crime of rape as a crime against humanity, our complaint is that the Trial Chamber erred, both in law and in fact, in not considering all of the relevant evidence and misconstruing the ambit of the nature of instigation. With regard to the 5th ground, the ground of joint criminal enterprise, we say that the Trial Chamber erred in law in not considering that joint criminal enterprise was properly pleaded -- a mode of liability which should have been considered by the Trial Chamber. With regard to the count concerning the definition of the elements of the crime of rape, we firstly say that that ground does not, in itself, affect the outcome of this appeal. But, however, it is a very important point of law which has been directly raised by the Trial Chamber in its judgment. And finally, with regard to the sentence appeal, we will submit that the sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate; that the Trial Chamber failed to -- amongst other errors -- pay appropriate attention, or give appropriate -- sufficient weight to the gravity of the crime and the appellant's role in committing the crimes. We will submit that the only appropriate sentence which should have been imposed, and which this Court should impose, is life imprisonment, not 30 years. Your Honour, that is the overview of the appeal. If I may now turn to the second ground in the Prosecution notice of appeal, that is, concerning the crime of murder as a crime against humanity. If the Court pleases, the appellant was acquitted of murder as a crime against humanity. The appeal by the Prosecution focuses on the decision by the Trial Chamber to acquit the appellant of the murders of the Tutsis women, Beatrice and Marie. The error which we say is disclosed in the Trial Chamber's judgment is found at paragraph 196 of the judgment. Shortly put, the evidence which was considered by the Trial Chamber is this: There was a statement overheard by a Prosecution witness, Witness TAS, who was accepted as a most credible and reliable witness. She overheard a person called -- a police officer called Kazoba -- which I will spell K-A-Z-O-B-A -- state that Gacumbitsi had ordered the killings of the Tutsi, and they were to commence with the murders of Marie and Beatrice. The Trial Chamber in its judgment accepted that the witness did hear that statement, they accepted that she was a reliable witness, that she did hear those words as she gave them on oath in Court. However, the Trial Chamber declined to use that evidence to convict the appellant of murder. The error, which we say is disclosed in their reasons, occurs at paragraph 196 of the judgment. The Trial Chamber says that, lacking sufficient cooperation, they declined to act upon the statement that the Witness TAS heard. It is our submission that the Trial Chamber, firstly, either did not correctly apprehend the nature of the corroborative evidence, or if the Trial Chamber did correctly apprehend it, it did not correctly apply a body of evidence which was in the Prosecution's case which was capable of -- in law and in fact -- supporting the testimony of Witness TAS. That is, there was a body of surrounding evidence, of cogent surrounding evidence, which goes to prove the truth of the statement overheard by Witness TAS, that is, the man Kazoba relating to someone else that Gacumbitsi had ordered the killings of those two women. As we set out in our appeal brief, it is not necessary, of course, for corroborative or supporting evidence to be capable, standing on its own, of proving any conclusion of fact. And it has been recently stated by this Chamber in the Kamuhanda judgment, evidence of a circumstantial nature can, of course, be corroborative or supporting. When one looks at the judgment, it is plain that there is a body of circumstantial evidence which, taken on its own, would not go anywhere to proving culpability for this crime. However, when that evidence is considered as an integrated whole, and when the evidence of the Witness TAS is considered with that supporting evidence, our submission is this: That there is no other inference, there is no other conclusion which is possibly open on a reasonable basis, other than that the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, ordered the murders of those two women. If the Court pleases, the matters relied upon by the Prosecution are set out in the written brief, but it is convenient now -- and I am conscious of the tight time constraints that we have -- but if I may just briefly set out the matters which we rely upon. Firstly, there is the fact that the Witness TAS overhears Kazoba say those things some time on the night of the 12th or the 13th of April. The circumstances under which Kazoba is saying these things to an unknown person can only suggest -- and can only mean that when Kazoba was saying it -- not knowing that he's being overheard by anyone, that when Kazoba was saying those things, he is saying them spontaneously, and he is saying them as an indication of the truth of the contents. There is no other possible construction which can be put on those words. There would be no reason, no rational reason for Kazoba to fabricate such a statement. We also know that, of course, the victims, Marie and Beatrice, were well-known to the appellant. They were his tenants. On the 13th of April the appellant, along with some police officers, had evicted the women from their home. The women were, of course, Tutsi. The appellant was angry with them when he spoke to them. He told them to get out or things would go badly for them. We also know, from the body of evidence contained within the Prosecution case, that in the days leading up to April 13, 1994, the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, had only one thing in his mind. The appellant was concerned with the planning, preparation, and organisation of mass violence, directed by the Hutu towards the Tutsi. We also know from the evidence that in those surrounding days, Sergeant Kazoba was frequently seen in the company of the appellant. It would seem that he was in his entourage; it would seem that he would be a man who would be privy to orders which were being communicated by the appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. When all of those facts is considered, including the fact that the two women die a violent death some time on the 13th or possibly early the next morning, it is our submission that there is no other inference which can be drawn from those prudent facts, other than what Sergeant Kazoba said was in fact an indication of what the appellant had ordered, that the appellant had ordered the deaths of those two females. Now, as we put in our written submissions, it is the case that the Trial Chamber, in determining what was to be done with the evidence which TAS gave, formed the view that there was no supporting evidence. The Trial Chamber did not articulate what it meant by "corroboration". Nor did the Trial Chamber go on to examine any other item of evidence which we say was corroborative -- in fact, is corroborative, and should be used to support the evidence of the witness. So, we say that the Trial Chamber fell into error. Firstly, an error of law -- that it either did not understand the nature of corroboration; that it possibly set the bar too high for corroboration. And the test for corroborative evidence should be, as we say, that it is evidence which merely supports the relevant piece of evidence and some material particular. </p>

            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>That was not articulated by the Trial Chamber. Now, if that correct test is applied, we say that there is that body of evidence which does go to support the testimony of TAS, which goes to -- just goes to prove the truth of the contents of the statement she overheard. In that respect, as we set out in our written brief, the hearsay evidence that TAS gives is invested with such a high degree of reliability, given that strong supporting circumstances, that that is the only conclusion which can be drawn. Your Honour, they are my oral submissions on that ground, unless there's any question the Court has of me. </p>

            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Thanks, Your Honours. I will be addressing the appeal in relation to the rape conviction, and the one regarding ordering. I will begin with the one in relation to rape. Your Honours, the Trial Chamber correctly returned a conviction of rape. This conviction was based on the testimony of Witness THU, who gave evidence that she was raped, in addition to her colleagues; seven other colleagues -- women and girls. However, Your Honour, the Trial Chamber erred by convicting him on the basis of only those rapes, and failing to convict him on other rapes which were proved beyond reasonable doubt. And I refer to these rapes as "other rapes", for the purposes of the submissions. These other rapes, Your Honour, were proven beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the testimony given by Witness TAS, TAO, and TAP. Before I go into the errors, Your Honours, I would like to provide a brief factual background which forms the basis of our appeal. It was proven by the Trial Chamber that on or about 17th April 1994, Gacumbitsi, in the company of others, went around Rusumo commune, and more specifically in the smaller part of this commune called Nyarubuye secteur, with a megaphone directly and publicly inciting Hutus to rape women. Following this instigation, immediately, Witness THU and seven women/girls were raped. The Trial Chamber found Gacumbitsi culpable for these rapes. Within the same location of Nyarubuye some other rapes took place, as described by Witness TAS, TAO, and TAP. Now, Your Honour, in finding Gacumbitsi culpable for the rapes of TAP and the seven women, the Trial Chamber found that those rapes took place immediately, and within the geographical location of the instigation. That is correct, and we do not want to contest that. The Trial Chamber was correct in returning a conviction of Gacumbitsi on the basis of those rapes. However, it erred when it failed to expand the basis of conviction regarding the other rapes, and our main contentions are four. Your Honour, the first one is: The Trial Chamber erred by narrowly construing the notion of instigation as a mode of participation. It construed it by requiring a very high threshold not required by the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, namely, a demonstration of cause/effect, as opposed to a demonstration that the instigation substantially contributed to the rapes. Then our second error -- the second error which we raise, Your Honour, is that the Trial Chamber erred, on the facts, that it unanimously accepted to draw the only conclusion, that the rapes of the other three women -- the rapes of other women was substantial -- I mean, it arose as a result of the instigation. It arose as a result of the substantial contribution of Gacumbitsi's instigation. Then a third error which we raise, Your Honour, is that, even assuming the Trial Chamber was correct not to find instigation as a basis of liability, it should have found Gacumbitsi liable on the basis of other -- Article 6 <stage>(1),</stage> modes of liability. And finally, our fourth principle error is that it should -- the Trial Chamber should have found Gacumbitsi culpable on the basis of Article 6 <stage>(3).</stage> Your Honour, I will quickly go back to the first error. The first error is that the Trial Chamber erred by narrowly construing the nature of the instigation. As I submitted, we don't contest the fact that following Gacumbitsi's instigation, Witness THU and seven women were immediately raped. But, in dismissing the culpability of the Accused on the basis of the other rapes, the Trial Chamber holds -- without explaining clearly -- that there was no causal nexus between the instigation committed by Gacumbitsi and the rapes. But, in view of the fact that the Trial Chamber had emphasised the notions of immediate -- immediacy and closeness, in terms of geographical location, of those rapes of THU and seven women, it seems clear that the Trial Chamber's conception of instigation was that it must be proven that the instigation causes the rapes. This approach, Your Honours, is wrong -- it's wrong because the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber is that the instigation must substantially contribute to the rapes or to the crimes. It should not be demonstrated by the Prosecution that without the instigation there would not have been crimes. What is required is that the Accused's participation contributes substantially to the crimes. And this is established in a number of cases, including Kayishema, paragraph 198, and other cases from the ICTY. Your Honour, by requiring the immediacy and the closeness in terms of geographical location, the Trial Chamber heightened the threshold. Given the fact that the witness -- given the fact that the other rapes also took place within the same timeframe -- and I will demonstrate in the second error -- I will demonstrate. And given that the crimes were perpetrated within the same location, our submission is that, actually, the other rapes met this heightened threshold. Your Honour, I will go to the second error, which is an error of fact. Your Honour, when you examine the facts which the Trial Chamber unanimously found as having been proven, our submission is that the only reasonable inference is that Gacumbitsi is culpable for the other rapes. And I will ask very quickly the -- our booth behind for the Powerpoint. I want to simply go through the facts, the factual findings, which the Trial Chamber unanimously accepted. If I can ask the booth for Powerpoint? </p>

            <p>Your Honour, a number of facts were accepted by the Trial Chamber, unanimously. Among which is, one: Gacumbitsi directly and publicly instigated rapes. Immediately following this instigation Witness THU and seven women were raped. In addition, other women were raped. Some of them were raped within the same location as the instigation, namely, Nyarubuye secteur. And these other rapes were committed within the same timeframe, mid-April 1994. Some witnesses -- the victims of the rapes -- confirmed that their rapists told them that they were executing Gacumbitsi's order. Other witnesses also explained that the crimes were perpetrated with atrocity in a manner which Gacumbitsi had stressed, namely, that those who resisted were supposed to be raped atrociously, including inserting instruments in their genitals. Furthermore, it was found by the Trial Chamber that these rapes were part and parcel of widespread attacks within the commune. Finally, it was established in several paragraphs of the judgment that Gacumbitsi was the bourgmestre; he was the highest authority in the commune. He had the obligation to ensure law and order. But despite his knowledge of these rapes, he did not take any steps to prevent them. Instead, he was directly involved in the commission of crimes against the Tutsi population. Your Honour, looking at all these facts, holistically, in light of the entire context of the crimes within Rusumo, and in light of the position Gacumbitsi held as the highest authority in the commune, our submission is that the only reasonable inference the Trial Chamber should have drawn is that these other rapes must be held on Gacumbitsi -- Gacumbitsi's instigation. Your Honour, the Appeals Chamber jurisprudence also is helpful on an appellant point, as it has been established in a number of cases by the Appeals Chamber, including Blaskic, paragraphs 41 and 42, and Kordic, paragraphs 31 and 32. Your Honour, it has been established that an accused participating in a crime with the knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood that crimes would be committed, that accused must be assumed to have accepted those crimes. Your Honours, the totality of the facts that the Trial Chamber accepted leads to the conclusion that Gacumbitsi accepted the commission of these crimes. He accepted not only that TAQ and seven women had been raped, but that rapes be committed widely, far and wide. The other rapes, as I said, were committed with the same timeframe and within the same geographical location, the secteur of Nyarubuye. So, Gacumbitsi set in motion, and he accepted setting in motion, a chain of events whose repercussions he knew very well. He knew that Tutsi women would be raped. And our submission is that he should be held accountable for those other rapes. Thirdly, I want to address very quickly the third ground of -- the third complaint, or third error, namely that even assuming the Trial Chamber would not hold Gacumbitsi culpable for instigation, they should have held him culpable for other modes of liability in Article 61. I don't want to go into those modes of liability, but I want to stress that, among other modes of liability, at the very least the Trial Chamber should have held Gacumbitsi culpable for aiding and abetting. Your Honours, as established in the Appeals jurisprudence, aiding and abetting involves a situation where an accused encourages, supports, or promotes the communal conduct. It is not required that the crimes take place at the scene of the encouragement, at the scene of the aiding. The crimes can be committed in a location far removed, or far -- I mean, in a location different from the scene of the aiding and abetting. In this case, we submit that, at the very least, besides planning, besides participation in joint enterprise -- which will be addressed by my learned colleague, Inneke Onsea -- at the very least, aiding and abetting would have been an available mode of liability to hold Gacumbitsi culpable. It's not in dispute that the manner in which he perpetrated the instigation, the manner in which he encouraged the commission of rapes; that this instigation substantially contributed to the perpetuation of rapes, in accordance with the jurisprudence of the Tribunal in relation to aiding and abetting. The same principle applies to other modes of liability, including planning, ordering. Most specifically I refer the Appeals Chamber to Kordic, Appeals Chamber. So our submission is that at the very least Gacumbitsi should have been held responsible for aiding and abetting. Finally, the final error we want to address is in relation to Article 6 <stage>(3).</stage> And our submission is that, even assuming that article 6.1 liability wasn't available, the Trial Chamber should have held Gacumbitsi culpable for -- he should have been held culpable as a superior, within the meaning of Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> of the statute. Your Honour, the fact <stage>(unintelligible),</stage> among other factors, demonstrate clearly that Gacumbitsi was a superior over and above not only the communal policemen, but other perpetrators of crimes. He was the highest authority in the commune. As the Trial Chamber found, he could give binding orders to anyone. He knew that crimes were being committed, but they were not -- he took no steps -- </p>

            <p>Could you please help me with this. I know you are pleading only in the trial text if 6.1 is not established, but how can you come to the conclusion that Mr. Gacumbitsi held a superior position over the perpetrators and then on the police forces in his capacity of bourgmestre? I think we have established in our jurisprudence the 6.3 responsibility in relation to military personnel. However, as regards civil personnel, it's highly disputed, and in particular, I can't see any responsibility or hierarchy or superior subordinate relationship between perpetrator and Mr. Gacumbitsi. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>I will quickly respond to that, Your Honour. I will -- I will address some parts of that question in my next -- next ground, but if I can quickly point out, Your Honour, although, as you actually pointed out, this mode of liability has been established for the military. The same mode of liability applies to civilians, because the main test, the main test, I must say, is what has got to be established is that an accused -- an accused possessed effective control over others. The manner in which his position of superior emerges is actually immaterial. What must be established -- actually, the position -- the position of superior can emerge formally or informally. It may be de jure or de facto. And that this Chamber has actually explained, if I can refer you to some jurisprudence, that -- I'll get to the jurisprudence in a moment -- that actually questions regarding the existence of effective control material ability are left to evidence. They are not matters of law. They are left to evidence. Because what is required is that it must be demonstrated that an accused possessed effective control, and this, in turn, means that he must possess the material ability to punish, prevent, or actually initiate proceedings for the punishment of perpetrators. Now, concerning the jurisprudence which I just pointed out that indicators of effective control are matters of evidence than substantive law, Your Honour, I'd like to refer you to Blaskic Appeals Chamber jurisprudence, article -- paragraph 69 and Aleksovski -- if I can spell that, A-L-E-K-S-O-V-S-K-I -- paragraph 76. So matters concerning effective control and material ability are matters for evidence, not matters of substantive law. Because superior responsibility is not confined to de jure formal relationship. It can emerge in a de facto setting. As long as it can be shown that the accused possessed effective control in the context of material ability to prevent and punish the crimes. Now, in the context of Gacumbitsi, as actually submitted in detail in our -- in our brief, Gacumbitsi possessed effective control over a wide range of perpetrators. He could punish. He could prevent. And at the very least, he could initiate proceedings against perpetrators. As explained by the Appeals Chamber, prevention or punishment is not limited to the direct -- to direct punishment, that an accused must directly punish by himself, but to certain situations where an accused in the same position can at least initiate proceedings against the perpetrators. Gacumbitsi was the bourgmestre of Rusumo. He was a high society in the commune. Gacumbitsi, as the Trial Chamber found, could give orders binding on everyone. So even assuming he was not capable of punishing himself, at the very least, he was in a position to initiate proceedings leading to the punishment of the perpetrators. So in our humble submission -- submissions, regarding the ground of rape, our position is that even assuming Article 6.1 culpability is not available, at the very least, Gacumbitsi should have been held liable under Article 6.3 given that she <stage>(sic)</stage> was a superior against a wide range of perpetrators of crimes, the Hutu population and Interahamwe, because he could or was in a position to prevent, punish, or initiate proceedings for the punishment of those who committed the other rapes for which Gacumbitsi wasn't held liable. I don't know whether I answered your question, Your Honour. </p>

            <speaker>JUDGE SCHOMBURG:</speaker>
            <p>Sorry, no. I'm not satisfied at all. Is it your submission that it formed part of customary international law in 1994 that you can be held criminally responsible for acts committed by perpetrators and that you can be seen as a superior to those perpetrators? And then in addition, isn't it a contradiction in itself that you request that a perpetrator, as is the position -- the opinion of the Prosecution and of -- in the judgement, that when you are acting yourself as a perpetrator, that you should take the necessary steps to punish, yourself? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-mugwanya">
            <speaker>MR. MUGWANYA:</speaker>
            <p>Thanks, Your Honour. In a given situation where an accused is directly involved, and this is the jurisprudence of the Tribunal, if an accused is directly involved in the crimes, it's preferred that the Prosecutor and the Trial Chamber is actually in - in establishing his culpability rely on Article 6.1, such that if he was also a superior in the same circumstances, that superior position will be relevant in sentencing. Now, in terms of the study you have given, whether it is a contradiction if an accused is actually perpetrator, then he wants to initiate proceedings against himself, my submission is that, well, he can be held responsible under 6.1, but the fact that he was also involved does not absolve him from the legal obligation that there are others over which he exercised effective control are brought to justice or they're reported to relevant authorities. So in our submission, really, even if an accused was directly involved with his own subordinates, that doesn't absolve him from the obligations under the law to initiate proceedings or to punish the perpetrators. Of course, I mean, of course, one may argue that he wouldn't do it because he wasn't involved, but his not doing it, actually, is the reason -- is the very reason why he should be held responsible under 6.3 as well, just assuming, for instance, if Article 6.1 is not established. But if he's established to be liable under 6.1, then his superiors -- superior position would be taken into account in sentencing. I will quickly -- I will quickly address our -- our sixth ground of appeal, which is in relation to the notion of ordering. Your Honour, our main -- our main errors which we submit were committed by the Trial Chamber are two. First, the Trial Chamber had in its construction of ordering -- the Trial Chamber required, which is wrong, that to establish culpability for ordering, it must be proven that the one giving an order was a former superior to those whom he gave the order, thereby reading Article 6.3 into the notion of ordering. Then our second area is that -- the second area we are raising is that the Trial Chamber, even on the facts, adds by failing to draw the only reasonable conclusion that on all the facts that were before it and on the basis of the facts it had accepted, the Accused gave orders to commit crimes. Maybe briefly, the factual basis of this first complaint is this: The Trial Chamber found that Gacumbitsi was culpable for ordering only in relation to the communal police, because the communal police, under the laws of Rwanda, were -- or was a de jure subordinate over the Accused. And, Your Honours, this can be found in -- in paragraphs -- in paragraph 243 of the judgement. So in the opinion of the Trial Chamber, although Gacumbitsi gave orders to perpetrators of crimes who were jointly involved in the perpetration of crimes, namely, communal police, Interahamwe, the Hutu population, gendarmerie, his order was confined to the communal policemen only, although these perpetrators were involved jointly, and even if Gacumbitsi gave the order to all of them. Your Honour, this is a wrong approach to the law. A look at paragraph 40 -- look at paragraph 243 of the -- of the judgement, the Trial Chamber holds that Gacumbitsi was not a superior over the other perpetrators of attacks because the law did not make him a superior. And the law did not put him in a -- in a position whereby he was in a formal administrative hierarchy as a superior. So in paragraph 243, the Trial Chamber emphasises the absence of the law that made him a superior and the absence of him being in a formal hierarchy and superior within the law. Your Honours, the Appeals Chamber jurisprudence is different on this. To prove he ordered, it's not required that the Prosecutor demonstrates that the Accused was a superior, strictly speaking, within the meaning of Article 6.3. What is required, as explained by the Appeals Chamber, is that an accused is in a position of authority and uses that position of authority to compel others to commit crimes. This is spelt out in a number of cases, among which is Kordic, Semanza, and Kamuhanda. It's not required that the Accused is a former superior. What is required is that he was in a position of authority to give orders or to give instructions, which instructions compel others to commit crimes. Your Honour, this was the position in the present case. De jure, we could submit that he was in that position. And even de facto he was in the position to compel others to commit crimes, and he, in fact, compelled them to commit crimes. This takes me to the second area we want to rely on, and this is the fact that even on the basis of the facts before the Trial Chamber, the facts the Trial Chamber unanimously accepted, the unreasonable conclusion is that the Accused was in a position of authority to give orders and that he gave orders, which orders were carried out by -- by the Accused. Your Honour, in our brief we detail -- we detail the factual findings, and these are found on paragraph 209 to paragraph 220 of our brief. But, in summary, besides him being a bourgmestre and being the highest authority in the commune, with the capacity to give binding orders on everyone, regardless of whether they were communal police or Interahamwe, Your Honours, the Accused was at massacre scenes. He gave instructions indiscriminately to groups of attackers, amongst which were communal policemen, and other perpetrators, Interahamwe, Hutu population. These attackers didn't hesitate in accepting or in following Gacumbitsi's orders. At the Nyarubuye parish, Your Honours, when Gacumbitsi struck down one of the victims and when he called upon the attackers to follow suit, they never hesitated in his appeal. He never begged them. He never convinced them. He never took the effort to convince them. Their response was immediate, a reflection of the fact that Gacumbitsi was in a position of authority to give instructions, and for those instructions to be obeyed. On other occasions, including his consistent visitations to various locations, Gacumbitsi gave instructions. These instructions were followed, among which were on 17 April he went round Rusumo commune instigating rapes. And as found by the Trial Chamber, immediately following those -- that instigation, Tutsis were raped. On 13th April, 1993 in Karama commune he called upon assailants to kill Tutsis. Tutsis were killed in the pursuit of the Accused's instruction. In Kanyinya, in Nyarubuye parish, and other locations, the Accused gave instructions. None of the perpetrators questioned his instructions. They all complied. In conclusion, Your Honour, without even taking much of the time of the Appeals Chamber, the facts summarised in those paragraphs demonstrate overwhelmingly that Gacumbitsi was in a position of authority to order, not only the communal policemen, but other perpetrators of crimes: Interahamwe, the Hutu population, gendarmerie. And our humble submission is that the Appeals Chamber corrects the area committed by the Trial Chamber by expanding the basis of Gacumbitsi's conviction for ordering to encompass not only communal policemen, but other perpetrators of crimes, perpetrators whom Gacumbitsi gave instructions to commit crimes, and they heeded to those instructions. Unless I am -- unless there are some questions. </p>

            <p>Good day, Mr. President, Your Honours. I'm going to address briefly quite a different situation. You've been hearing grounds of appeal advanced in relation to errors that the Prosecutor submits the Trial Chamber made. In this particular case, there is no complaint about the way in which the Trial Chamber dealt with the particular situation. The complaint relates to the legal framework within which the Trial Chamber was compelled to deal with the situation, and we are seeking redress in relation to that legal framework. The Trial Chamber got it right, but it had to deal with the situation I'm about to address within a legal framework which we submit needs to be clarified and changed. Rape was used as an instrument of genocide in Rwanda in the period from April through June of 1994. Now, this cruel fact is well documented. The UN special rapporteur in speaking about the situation of human rights in Rwanda in that period reported rape was systematic and was used as a weapon by the perpetrators of the massacres. And we've given the references that I'm going to be used in our brief. We've developed this argument fully within our brief. And this fact clearly emerges from cases tried before this Tribunal, cases such as Akayesu, and more recently Muhimana, and it is obviously a central feature of the case before you now. Now, the Trial Chamber in this case handled the definition of rape in international law and its application to the facts impeccably. And as I've mentioned, this ground of appeal relates not to the Trial Chamber's handling of the definition of rape and its application to the facts, but rather to the legal framework within which the Trial Chamber was compelled to work, given the current state of the law. And we're requesting that you adjust that legal framework and give the definition of rape and sexual violence a shape that is appropriate in international criminal law. What I would like to do is outline the position that we take, note what the Trial Chamber did, and then explain where the tension lies, why there's an issue at all. Because you may be wondering, you know, why there is an issue. And I'll explain why there's an issue and then come to our prayer for relief. Our position is simply this: Given the coercive circumstances inherent in rape as an international crime, the presumption should be that the victim did not consent and that the perpetrator knew about that absence of consent. In the usual case, the Prosecution should not be required to prove the absence of consent in the victim and the knowledge of this on the part of the perpetrator. In other words, non-consent and knowledge of non-consent are not essential elements of the crime of rape that the Prosecution must establish. Now, the only exception to this rule would be where, in the circumstances of a particular case, the evidence discloses a defensive consent that has an air of reality within the procedural and admissibility requirements of Rule 96. Only then, only then would the Prosecutor have to discredit the Defence and prove that there was no viable consent on the part of the victim and that the perpetrator knew this or was aware of circumstances that would reasonably have put him on notice. Had this been the rule, then the Trial Chamber would not have had even to address the issue of consent as it did at paragraph 325 of the judgement. I was going to quote that to you, but I just leave you with that reference. It is -- it is elegantly and efficiently dealt with in that paragraph. And our submission is that the Trial Chamber would not even have had to address the issue of consent if the rule were as I have submitted it should be. Because in the end, in a case such as this one, and this is a good example of such a case, we submit that there is no useful forensic purpose that is served by requiring a Trial Chamber to address the issue of non-consent. And really, what I'm getting at is what lies behind the Trial Chamber having to address that issue. And that is the question that has to be put to the victim or to the witness. It's the handling of the evidence which lies behind, of course, the Trial Chamber's having to address such an issue. We submit that there's just no useful forensic purpose in the normal case for that. We've taken the opportunity to raise the issue in this appeal because we're not likely to get another chance for a long time until quite late in the life of this Tribunal, as far as we can see. You may be aware that there was recently a conviction for rape as a crime against humanity in the case of Muhimana. But in that case the parties were agreed on the definition of rape, and the issue that we want to raise in this appeal doesn't appear in Muhimana's notice of appeal. So it's not going to come before you in that case, as far as we can determine. And yet, we have a number of cases in trial now where rape has been charged, and we have cases pending where rape is charged. So the definition of the crime is a matter of importance to the Prosecutor. The Chamber is well aware of the Trial Chamber's definition of rape in Akayesu. I'm going to read that because it is important and it's really our -- our baseline, it's our position. The Trial Chamber defined rape in clear but flexible terms as follows at paragraph 598 of its judgement in Akayesu. I quote: "The Chamber defines rape as a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive. Sexual violence, which includes rape, is considered to be any act of a sexual nature which is committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive." Now, it is said that there is a tension -- has been said, let me put it that way, that there is a tension between that elegant definition and the later elaboration of the definition in the case of Kunarac. And this Chamber is well aware of the case. A definition was elaborated by the Trial Chamber in Kunarac, and it was accepted by the ICTY Appeals Chamber. And I would submit that the definition accepted was compatible with Akayesu except that it explicitly injected into the definition the requirement that non-consent on the part of the victim be proved as part of the actus reus of the crime and that the knowledge of this non-consent be proved as a component of the mens rea of the crime, as I read Kunarac. Nevertheless, the Appeals Chamber in Kunarac went on to say at paragraph 130, and I quote: "The circumstances giving rise to the instant appeal and that prevail in most cases charged as either war crimes or crimes against humanity will be almost universally coercive, that is to say, true consent will not be possible." The same observation I would submit would apply to genocide. My submission is that the Akayesu definition and the Kunarac definition is more apparent than real. In the end, the coercive circumstances that inevitably emerge from the evidence in the cases we deal with make the issue of consent or non-consent superfluous. As I've said the good example is the respondent's. I mention to you the Muhimana decision, and in that case, the Trial Chamber has tried to reconcile Akayesu and Kunarac. Both the Defence and the Prosecution in Muhimana accepted the Akayesu definition, and I would refer you to paragraph 535 of the Muhimana decision. And the Trial Chamber then went on at paragraph 400 -- I'm sorry, 546 of its judgement to place the emphasis on the coercive circumstances feature of the Kunarac decision. Our submission is that the focus should be upon the conduct and the state of mind of the accused and not upon the conduct and the state of the mind of the victim, except in the exceptional case where the evidence throws up a potential defence of consent. And Kunarac, of course, is an example of that. There was a consent defence or a mistaken belief in consent defence in relation to one of the incidents, as I recall. And the Trial Chamber had little difficulty in disposing of that, given the circumstances of the case. So that defence can come up. The accused is not barred from raising the defence in an appropriate case, and then it will be dealt with and the burden of proof will be on the Prosecution. Now, I suppose I could just sum up our position by submitting to you that what I'm suggesting the approach ought to be is the approach that the ICTY Appeals Chamber accepted for the crime of enslavement. And I would submit to you that enslavement, like rape, implies an overbearing of the free will. But the Prosecutor is not required to prove lack of consent or knowledge of lack of consent in the case of enslavement as an essential element of the crime. And yet, the Appeals Chamber in Kunarac accepted that in an appropriate case, if on the evidence the Defence could say, "Well, there was consent, this wasn't a case of enslavement, the person was willingly doing what the evidence discloses," in that situation, the Chamber will consider the evidence in order to determine whether or not the Prosecution has discharged its burden of proof. And in our submission, a similar approach to rape would be entirely workable and would recognise the nature of rape as an international crime. I just want to touch very briefly on a point we've developed in our written brief. Both the Akayesu Trial Chamber and the Kunarac Trial Chamber noted that a common feature of the definition of rape in domestic jurisdictions was its nonconsensual nature. All I'm saying is that in domestic jurisdictions the law has to cover a spectrum of behaviour. And at one end of the spectrum you have behaviour which resembles very closely consensual behaviour, and so it becomes essential in order to prove a crime of offence that the nonconsensual nature of the behaviour be established. However, in domestic jurisdictions, at the other end of the spectrum, there are situations where consent is simply vitiated by power imbalance, by threat, by whatever. And I would submit that it's that end of the domestic spectrum of law, if you will, that really offers the better parallel to the situation that you have to deal with in international criminal law. Rape is not even cognisable as a crime under our jurisdiction unless it is an instrument of genocide causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group that's targeted, or it is linked to a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population on discriminatory grounds so as to make it a crime against humanity, or it qualifies as a violation of the Geneva Conventions. So going in, rape as a crime in international criminal law is necessarily linked to a situation of violence or oppression. In my submission, this should be recognised frankly by this Chamber. I'm not going to read the passage to you, but there is, in my submission, a striking passage in the Trial Chamber's decision in Akayesu at paragraph 597 where the Trial Chamber compares rape to torture and speaks about rape being used for the purposes of intimidation, degradation, humiliation, discrimination, punishment, control, or destruction of a person. That is the -- that is the dreadful quality of crime in our jurisdiction. And in my submission, this Chamber should take the next logical step which, I submit, is anticipated in the Kunarac judgement and find that the Prosecution accept where a viable defence comes up on the evidence is not required -- is not required to address explicitly the issue of consent or non-consent, and neither should a Trial Chamber. Thank you. </p>

            <p>One question. Mr. Stewart, I must say that I am much attracted to your arguments, but tell me this: In the present state of customary international law, is the burden on the Prosecution to prove absence of consent in rape? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-stewart">
            <speaker>MR. STEWART:</speaker>
            <p>Well, my submission is that the burden on the Prosecution is to prove an aggressive act that happens to have a sexual character because, as opposed to demonstrating a case where someone has taken a machete and sliced off an arm, what has happened is that the person has been thrown to the ground and a stick has been shoved into her genitals, or she has been raped in the sense that she's been -- been taken by a man. </p>

            <p>Well, I ask you this question: In view of the disposition of the Tribunal to infer absence of consent on proof by the Prosecution of coercive circumstances, is there any pressing need for the Tribunal to go, once more, into this question of discharging the Prosecution from the obligation to prove lack of consent? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-stewart">
            <speaker>MR. STEWART:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. President, I suppose what I am pleading for is the repute of international criminal justice and the situation of victims of rape, be they male or female. If it is clear that that inquiry is not a necessary one, then, of course, the evidence is going to be led about the coercive circumstances, as it is now. But no one is going to have to put a question to a witness to ask the obvious, a question that may seem surreal to the witness, even hurtful, and yet, we do preserve the ability of an accused person in an appropriate case. We haven't discussed such cases, and it's probably not appropriate to do it in this case, but we certainly have racked our brains to -- to discover such cases. And there are some cases where, although the Prosecution would likely be able to meet its burden reasonably easily, still the issue would come up. I'm talking about situations of concubinage where potential victims of genocide are, in essence, sheltered from the killing by being attached to a powerful man who is able to protect them. And you have a very interesting situation there that would need, perhaps, to be explored forensically in the appropriate case. But in the normal case, such as this one, it just -- it just seems such an unnecessary step, and it's not one required in the case of other crimes such as enslavement. So it may be a counsel perfection, Mr. President, but I make it. </p>

            <p>I understand, Mr. Stewart, but tell me this: If it is this state now of customary international law that the burden is on the Prosecution to prove absence of consent, then does it lie within the power of this Appeals Chamber of this Tribunal to reverse that burden? </p>

            <p>My answer to that, Mr. President, Judges are always, at least in the traditions that you and I could from, discovering the law that exists. And I would submit that the law has been discovered perhaps in a way that's not quite perfect. And customary international law, in fact, permits you to do what we request that you do on an examination of -- of the factors that Kunarac and Akayesu examined. It's just, in a sense, a recalibration of the law. It's a shifting, if you will, of -- of the definition, and I submit it's quite within your ambit to do it. </p>

            <p>One last question: Article -- Rule 96 <stage>(ii)</stage> does seem, arguably, to place on the Defence the burden of proving lack of consent or consent.

            <p>If you -- I'm familiar with the rule, but I just want to check that paragraph again so that I don't misspeak myself. My submission is that that really reflects the state of the law in domestic jurisdictions where, as I mentioned, consent is vitiated. And it only casts an evidentiary burden, if I can put it that way, or a burden of persuasion on the Defence which is quite acceptable. It's not a shifting of the burden of proof. It's simply to -- to -- what it alerts the Defence to is the need to produce evidence that gives the issue of consent an air of reality. In other words, it simply can't be raised in a vacuum. It has to be connected to the case. It's no more than that, I submit. </p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. A very short question. I'm really surprised that you come with this submission right now after the Kunarac appeal judgement. If my recollection serves me right, in Kunarac appeal we explicitly stated when there is such a coercive situation, there is no need to prove the absent of consent. Referring also to domestic law in different countries where there is a rule when, for example, a prisoner is extremely vulnerable and helplessness <stage>(sic),</stage> then the absent of consent needs not to be proven. It would be the rationale behind, and I think we emphasised this in Kunarac in relation to a camp situation, that it would be cynical to ask the victim of a rape whether there was consent or not. Do I understand you correctly, that you're aiming at developing the law from the Kunarac appeal one step further, that not only in the situation of a camp, but also in the situation we had before us in 1994? Women were in a situation of helplessness, particular vulnerable, and therefore, it would be, again, cynical to ask for -- whether or not there was a consent. Of course, there might be situations, as you've correctly indicated where, in fact, there is consent, and then the burden of proof is, no doubt, lost. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-stewart">
            <speaker>MR. STEWART:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, I take comfort from your question, because it's certainly the way we read Kunarac practically. We put the emphasis on the coercive circumstances. The concern -- and you're absolutely correct that we, in a sense, are looking for an expansion of -- of the approach that you've just described across the board, so that it's an unusual case where consent becomes the issue, not one where we have to worry about it. You know, in the Kunarac trial, the question was put to the witnesses. I remember that. Counsel had to put that question to the witnesses. Now, they found a way of putting it which was -- was the least harmful. I think the question that was framed was, "Did this occur against your will?" And of course the witness then had to chance to expand on just how much that was the case. But that's -- because in the Kunarac definition at the trial level, which was accepted, but then, I would submit, softened and modified in the way you've described by Appeals Chamber, because those elements are still there in black and white, we're requesting the clarification. And it may be that it's just a clarification of what was intended by the Appeals Chamber in Kunarac, and if we get that, we'll be very, very satisfied. Thank you. </p>

            <p>Good morning, once again, Your Honours. I will now deal with the fifth ground of appeal pertaining to the refusal of the Trial Chamber to rely upon joint criminal enterprise as a basis for individual criminal responsibility of the Accused. Our submission is that the Trial Chamber was wrong in deciding in paragraph 289 of the judgement that joint criminal enterprise was not pleaded clearly enough to allow the Accused to defend himself adequately. The Trial Chamber erred in law for two reasons, and these will be my two submissions. First, the Prosecution gave adequate notice to the Accused that it intended to charge him under a theory of common purpose liability as a co-perpetrator of a joint criminal enterprise. Second, the findings of the Trial Chamber show that the Accused acted, in fact, as a co-perpetrator of a joint criminal enterprise. He should have been held liable as a participant in a joint criminal enterprise. My oral submissions cover paragraphs 184 to 211 of the Prosecution's appellant's brief relating to the ground 5 on pages 60 to 74. But before I will start, Your Honours, with the gist of my submissions, I would like to bring an issue to your attention which was not raised during trial nor during the appeal by parties until this stage. The paragraphs in the indictment which, in our submission, refer to joint criminal enterprise liability, namely, paragraphs 22 and 25, are, strictly speaking, grouped under the count of genocide and complicity in genocide. However, it is clear from an examination of the record that the Prosecution was pursuing a joint criminal enterprise theory for all crimes charged. In this appeal we maintain the position that the indictment should be read as a whole and that, therefore, joint criminal enterprise liability is pleaded in paragraphs 22 and 25 of the indictment was pursued in relation to all counts. First, notice issue. The real issue is, Your Honours, whether the Accused was given sufficient information that the Prosecution was relying upon a theory of common-purpose liability in order to be able to prepare his defence. The Prosecution submits that in this case the Accused did receive adequate notice. The Defence knew the case they had to meet. It was clear from the language and the acts charged in the indictment that the Prosecution was relying upon the common-purpose theory. And further, consistent notice was given in the pre-trial brief, the opening statement, the evidence as it unfolded at trial, and the arguments made in the closing brief. I want to lead you now through the notice procedure and the relevant documents through which notice was given. These documents are referred to our appellant's brief, and you will find the paragraphs in the briefs in the footnotes. That's why I suggest to you, Your Honours, that I will not repeat the paragraphs now during my oral submission, but I refer Your Honours to the written submissions we made in that respect. First, the indictment. This is the first place where the Accused, in our submission, received notice that he was charged under a joint criminal enterprise theory. We acknowledge that in light of the recent decisions as the Kvocka appeals judgement, the indictment is vague because it fails to make specific mention of joint criminal enterprise, and it fails to plead the specific form of joint criminal enterprise which is being alleged. Having said that, the indictment did include information which put the Accused on notice. Paragraphs 22 and 25 of the indictment explicitly charges the Accused for acting in concert with other people in furtherance of a common plan. And I will read these paragraphs out for you. Paragraph 22: "From those first days of April 1994 through 30 April 1994, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi ordered, directed or acted in concert with local administrative officials in Kibungo préfecture, including bourgmestres and conseillers de secteur, to deny protection to civilian Tutsi refugees and to facilitate attacks upon them by communal police, Interahamwe, civilian militias, and local residents." Paragraph 25: "Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, in his position of authority and acting in concert with others, participated in the planning, preparation, or execution of a common scheme, strategy or plan to exterminate the Tutsis by his own affirmative acts or through persons he assisted or by his subordinates with his knowledge and consent." Although the label used in the indictment is "acting in concert with," the label described the same situation as acting pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise. At the time when the indictment was drafted and confirmed in June 2001, the expressions "joint criminal enterprise," "common purpose" and "criminal enterprise" were all used interchangeably. It is commonly accepted that a reference to acting in concert together means acting together pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise. However, irrespective of what label has been used in the indictment, what is important, Your Honours, is that the underlying concept is always there. The concept as such was pleaded in the indictment. In line with the Kvocka appeals judgement, the indictment pleads the material facts underlying the joint criminal enterprise, namely, the purpose of the enterprise, the identity of the participants, and the Accused's participation in the enterprise. The purpose of the enterprise: The indictment pleads the shared intent to destroy the Tutsi population and actions taken by the accused in furtherance -- in furtherance of this aim, namely, the criminal acts charged. The identity of the participants: At least four individuals were identified by name in the indictment. In addition, groups of individuals such as administrative personnel at a level of the commune, including conseillers de secteur, responsables de cellule, communal police, Interahamwe, and civilian militias were referenced as being involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the Accused. The nature of the Accused's participation in the enterprise was also described in the indictment. The Accused's position as a bourgmestre of Rusumo commune in Kibungo préfecture at the time relevant to the indictment. Next, his authority to organise and direct the genocide that ensued in Rusumo commune. Third, the indictment describes the Accused circulating about Rusumo in a vehicle belonging to the commune and actively encouraging attacks targeted on Tutsi by making speeches aimed at destroying the Tutsi group. In addition, the Accused is alleged to have organised meetings with military and administrative officials and arranging the transport of communal police, Interahamwe, and weapons in furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsi population. In addition to the indictment, Your Honours, the factual allegations in the pre-trial brief point to -- </p>

            <p>I will. I will, Your Honours. I'm sorry. My apologies to the interpreters. In addition to the indictment, the factual allegations in the pre-trial brief point to the existence of a common criminal plan amongst the attackers in which the Accused played a pivotal role. Some examples: The pre-trial brief states that the Accused organised the campaign of destruction of the Tutsi civilian population by planning, preparing, and executing the looting pillaging, torturing, raping, and killing in Rusumo commune, Kibungo prefecture. The pre-trial brief also includes specific allegations of planning and inciting other participants in the attacks to kill the Tutsi civilian population throughout the commune. It described meetings organised or attended by the Accused. These meetings gathered the most senior and influential persons. During these meetings, anti-Tutsi sentiments were expressed, and calls for the extermination of the Tutsi were made. It described the Accused inciting the conseillers de secteur, responsables de cellule, the chiefs of the MRD -- MRND and CDR political parties and the population in Rusumo commune to attack and kill the Tutsi throughout -- throughout the commune. It also pointed out that these actions formed part of a larger scheme to destroy the Tutsi population. On top of that, the allegations in the Prosecution's pre-trial brief, in particular with respect to the central incidents in Nyarubuye parish attacks, reflected existence of a joint action and purpose to destroy the Tutsi population. It is our submission, therefore, that viewed as a whole, the indictment, together with the pre-trial brief, put the Accused on notice that the Prosecution was relying upon a common purpose doctrine of liability.

However, the jurisprudence of the Appeals Chamber also states very clearly that vagueness may be cured, and our submission is that this vagueness has been cured during this case, not only in the indictment itself, because the indictment pleads the material facts underlying this mode of liability as required by the Kvocka Appeals Chamber, but it also -- also through notice given in the pre-trial brief, as I just pointed out to you, notice given in the opening statement during trial.

            <p>Excuse me? My assumption is that Kvocka was decided after the judgement of the Trial Chamber in the case of Gacumbitsi. So in looking at the context of the paragraph of the judgement which my learned colleague Judge Güney cited, I don't think that Kvocka really is here -- should be here used to analyse the error or not error made by the trial Court in Gacumbitsi. Now, looking at this paragraph 289, we read: "The Chamber cannot make a finding on such allegations" -- that there was participation in joint criminal enterprise - "since it was not pleaded clearly enough to allow the Accused to defend himself adequately."So putting quite apart from Kvocka, if it is true, as you are arguing, that the Prosecution really meant to allege joint criminal enterprise liability, why didn't it simply use the words "joint criminal enterprise"? You spoke about the sort of equivalent value of this expression and certain other expressions used in the indictment. Given how easy it would have been for the Prosecution to use these words, couldn't a reasonable Defence attorney take the omission of these words from the indictment as strong evidence that no joint criminal enterprise was being alleged? I'm following the question presented by Judge Güney. </p>

            <p>Thank you for your question, Your Honour. Our submission is, like I said in the introduction, that at the time when the indictment was drafted and the indictment was confirmed, the different terms were used interchangeably. I do agree -- we do acknowledge that it would have been better to have used the term "joint criminal enterprise," but at the time, different concepts were used to describe the same situation: Common purpose, criminal enterprise, acting in concert with. And, in fact, Ntakirutimana, and I can refer to the footnote, it is also acknowledge by the Appeals Chamber that these concepts were used interchangeably, and that at this moment we speak about participation in the joint criminal enterprise. And that's why we also used this term in our appeal submissions. Now, the second part of your question comes down to notice. Did the Prosecution give sufficient notice to the Defence that a common-purpose doctrine was alleged? In our submission we did: First the indictment, afterwards in the pre-trial brief, and during the trial. In fact, the first time that joint criminal enterprise was used as a term was in the Prosecution's closing brief, but it was clear that the situation which was described there, was always being alleged against the Accused. And, in fact, the Accused knew that he was charged with the common-purpose doctrine. In his closing statement -- in his closing brief on page 65, he refers to that. And he says, "Well, there is not enough evidence," but then it also implies that he understood the concept as such. </p>

            <p>May I ask you one question? I don't claim any paternity over Tadic, though I was one of the Judges there, probably the presiding Judge. But my understanding is that the case proceeded on the basis that it was not legislative. It was putting forward a judicial construct based on its own analysis of the doctrines pertaining to the field. Now, do I understand you to be saying some of the more recent decisions to which you have referred require the Prosecutor, if the Prosecutor is relying on JCE, specifically to mention JCE in the indictment? </p>

            <p>Your Honours, one of the reasons -- I think one of the important implications of this ground is that, in fact, we have a lot -- we have other indictments before this Tribunal where a same common -- common-purpose doctrine is being alleged without, in fact, using the words "joint criminal enterprise" as such. I would advise as a Prosecutor to other colleagues, if they come to me today with an indictment in which joint criminal enterprise is being alleged, to specifically put in the terms and to specifically refer to the -- to the concept as such. Now, in this indictment, the underlying situation was being described, and the material facts were also pleaded in the indictment. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-weston">
            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you. If I may turn to the last ground in the Prosecution appeal, the ground pertaining to sentence. Thirty years imprisonment for the crimes of genocide, extermination as a crime against humanity, and rape as a crime against humanity, given the position which this Appellant held, the power that he wielded and the grave consequences his actions caused, 30 years' imprisonment is manifestly inadequate. This Chamber, of course, has a limited jurisdiction in correcting sentence matters. As is well established law, this Chamber may only intervene if the Appellant demonstrates a discernible error of law. That is the case here. The sentence of 30 years imprisonment for the crimes which Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, the Appellant, committed in April 1994, involving the use of his position as bourgmestre which involved his planning, instigation, ordering, aiding and abetting, and to some degree, committing the crime of genocide, his involvement on the same basis for the crimes of -- for the crime of extermination and his role in instigating rape.These crimes can only be punished, can only be properly punished -- can only be adequately punished when the principles of deterrence and culpability of sentences are considered by the imposition of a term of life imprisonment. The Appellant -- sorry, the Respondent on this appeal, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, is a man of middle years. He is completely corrupt of any exceptional mitigating circumstance. Over matters which can be pleaded in mitigation of penalty, such as the fact that the man was of previous good character, has a family, and had performed his duties as bourgmestre in an efficient matter, all those matters are only exceptional; they cannot carry any significant weight at all in fixing the final sentence. So that is the Prosecution position on appeal. The sentence of 30 years' imprisonment imposed upon the Appellant Gacumbitsi is manifestly far too low. It does not reflect the two paramount considerations on sentence, namely, the gravity of the crimes and the offender's role in the commission of those crimes. As I have just said, there are no significant mitigating circumstances in this man's favour which can counter-balance in any way the gravity of the crimes which he has committed. Now, if the Court pleases, one striking aspect of the Trial Chamber's judgment regarding sentences is that in the discussion concerning sentence, there was essentially no meaningful analysis by the Chamber of culpable decisions of this Chamber, or the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia for the sentences of these crimes. There was some -- I hesitate to use the word "review", but there was some listing of a number of cases, ranging from persons who were secondary offenders, such as Ruggiu, who received a 12-year sentence, up to a brief list of others who had committed the crimes of genocide and have received life imprisonment. The reasons of the Trial Chamber regarding sentence are, with respect, quite unsatisfactory and quite inadequate. There is no meaningful explanation advanced by the Chamber as to how it fixed this term of 30 years imprisonment. With regard to the gravity of the crimes, it is the Appellant's position that the crimes committed by Sylvestre Gacumbitsi are amongst the most serious which have come before this Chamber. On the evidence which was accepted by the Trial Chamber, and that is the evidence upon which the man must be sentenced, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi who had been bourgmestre for some 11 years prior to 1994, in early April 1994, used his official position to convene a meeting of his subordinate conseillers, he used that meeting to instruct them to again begin, in effect, a campaign of violence directed against the defenceless Tutsi minority within his commune. The Appellant, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, further used his position to actively involve himself in the distribution of weapons. He used his position, the authority which stems from the position as bourgmestre in Rwanda, to incite the Hutu population to commit acts of violence against the Tutsi. He used his official position to instruct a person called André to prevent refugees crossing into Tanzania. Possibly the most egregious example of this man's great criminalities is: Over a three-day period, he was instrumental in the mass killing of a very large number of defenceless and helpless Tutsi refugees. The Trial Chamber made no precise finding or even any approximate finding as to the number of deaths which are on this man's hands, but it is the case that there is reliable evidence from a number of Prosecution witnesses, who were accepted, that there were thousands of refugees at the parish in the middle of April. One estimate had them as possibly 20,000 or more. There is also the evidence that no significant violence occurred to the refugees at the parish until Sylvestre Gacumbitsi arrived and gave, in effect, the order or the instruction for the killing to commence. Sylvestre Gacumbitsi did not walk away from that killing. He revisited that massacre site on each of the following two days. And it would seem on the evidence that his only purpose -- his sole purpose was to ensure that the maximum number of Tutsi refugees were killed, that there were to be no survivors. This evidence demonstrates beyond any doubt that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi was involved in the commission of mass violence towards the Tutsi minority from early April onwards; that his involvement was not momentary, it was not hesitant; that his involvement was that of a committed genocidaire, a person who was wholeheartedly divided towards trying to kill as many Tutsi as possible. We further have the evidence that in mid-April, and this pertains particularly to the crime of rape as a crime against humanity, that Sylvestre Gacumbitsi committed this attack as part of this attack on the Tutsi minority, he committed a particular sadistic zeal. The Court will be familiar with the evidence principally coming from the Witness TAQ, pertaining to the crime of rape, that the Appellant Gacumbitsi used his authority as bourgmestre to instigate rape and to incite rape. Moreover, that the particular mind with which the rapes were to be committed were, without question, horrific. This, the Prosecution says, shows a particular savage dimension to the man's criminality. On the evidence which this Chamber should accept and which the Trial Chamber did accept, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi played, really, an instrumental role in the attack upon the Tutsi refugees within Rusumo commune, a role which was only possible because of his official position, a role which was enhanced by the powers he was able to use or the position of authority he had conferred upon him as bourgmestre. Now, it is established rule that the gravity of the crimes and the offender's role to the most important considerations, if not the two most important considerations, is that it's important to take into account: Here on the evidence, the crimes of mass grave, the offender's role was at the highest level in the commission of those particular crimes. He was not an unwilling subordinate reluctantly following orders. He is not a mere aider and abettor, a mere facilitator. The Prosecution submits that those matters warrant and condone sentence. Furthermore, it is the case that when regard <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> practice of this Chamber for persons in a position of authority of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's or analogues of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's, committing the crimes of genocide and extermination, the appropriate sentence is life imprisonment. The Chamber has had the benefit of a number of cases cited by the Prosecution in our Appellant's brief. In addition, I should mention some more recent decisions of this Chamber. There is the decision of Kamuhanda from this Court. Your Honours may recall that Mr. Kamuhanda was a minister in the government. He was minister for higher education, but his role was quite close to that of Mr. Gacumbitsi. He was a person who was important in a local area, a regional sort of politician. He was convicted of genocide and extermination; his criminality was essentially limited to one massacre where some thousands of people were killed. His role in that massacre was essentially this: That he arrived there with some armed followers; he gave an order or an instruction to Hutu assailants to commence the attack; he then departed. Kamuhanda was a man of approximately the same age as Gacumbitsi; again, a man of previous good character; a man who'd been a solid public servant to the people of Rwanda prior to 1994; a man with a family -- the same mitigating circumstances pleaded in Sylvestre Gacumbitsi's cause. Notwithstanding the fact that Kamuhanda's role was not as protracted as well as Gacumbitsi, this Court held that a life sentence was the appropriate sentence. If I may also refer the Court to the -- its decision in Kajelijeli. Kajelijeli, like Gacumbitsi, was a bourgmestre. He was a middle level official in the Rwandan regime. Like Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, he was a man of previous good character before 1994 <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> useful service to the Rwandan state. Kajelijeli was convicted after a trial of, again, genocide and extermination. Again, he was involved in the planning, facilitation, aiding and abetting and instigation of the genocide. He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment. This Chamber was not -- only intervened to this limited extent: It held that Kajelijeli had suffered some violations of his pre-trial rights; he'd been unlawfully detained for ten months, and so it was appropriate to compensate him for that, therefore, a term of life imprisonment was converted into a fixed sentence of 45 years, which is still 50 percent higher than that imposed upon Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. That mitigating feature, that special feature in Kajelijeli's case does not appear here. There is no pre-trial violation of Gacumbitsi's right. That being so, both Kamuhanda and Kajelijeli are compelling authority or position that a life sentence should be imposed upon Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. Furthermore, it might be said against the Prosecution that 30 years imprisonment is a heavy sentence, and it might also be said that there is no material distinction between 30 years and life imprisonment. That cannot be correct. If we look at Kajelijeli, there, the conversion was from life to 45 years to compensate him for his pre-trial violations. Further, the Court held there was a material distinction between the 45 years' imprisonment and 30 years' imprisonment. It is not the case that 30 years and life imprisonment are effectively analogous. If the Court pleases, if there is no intervention by this Court on the Prosecution appeal, if the Prosecution appeal is dismissed, if a life sentence is not imposed upon Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, then this Court is effectively saying that for persons who wielded considerable power in a regional setting, who are deeply involved in the planning, instigation, aiding and abetting, ordering and, to a limited degree, committing genocide and extermination, even with that particular aggravating sadistic zeal, which we say has been demonstrated in the case of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, this Court would be saying to the world that 30 years' imprisonment is a suitable sentence and that the range for these crimes stems as low as 30 years, even when there is no mitigating or special mitigating feature in an accused's waiver. That, we submit, would simply throw culpable sentences into complete disarray. Your Honour, the Prosecution relies upon the matters contained in its written outline. Those are my oral submissions, subject to any assistance I may give the Court. </p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Weston, what would you submit should be an appropriate sentence if the Bench did two things: First, if the Bench upheld the argument that Mr. Gacumbitsi engaged no criminal responsibility for killing anybody; and if, two, the Bench rejected your argument that in any event such a holding would be cancelled out by a finding of responsibility on the ground of JCE? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-weston">
            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Your Honour. That decision is this: When the liability of the Appellant is examined, the Trial Chamber held that there were a number of different modes of liability which he had incurred. There was planning, instigation, ordering, aiding and abetting, and committing. Now, of course, the committing, as was evident from the interchange between the Bench and the Bar this morning, was currently <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> them to his involvement to the killing of the one man at the massacre site. If that multiplied liability of committing would have been struck out, of course, the other modes would still stand. On the evidence the mode of liability of committing was relatively the least serious of the modes of liability. As I just submitted, it was confined to the death of one man. When I said that, I do not mean to diminish the impact or the gravity of the death of that individual, but I'm merely speaking in a relative term to the other crimes which the Appellant has been convicted. When the other modes of liability are considered, as I was submitting a moment ago, this man was involved in the bringing about the deaths of probably thousands of individual innocent people, as well as the commission of some atrocious rapes on seven innocent victims. As I also submitted, his involvement in doing that was instrumental. Our submission would be that if the Chamber did come to the conclusion that committing cannot be sustained as a matter of law, for whatever reason, that that would not affect the sentence. And, again, if I may refer to the culpable case of Kamuhanda, he was not a committer, as such, but was an orderer, instigator. I probably said "orderer", I don't think that's a correct English word, but he was guilty of ordering and instigating. Again, for genocide and extermination, but on the facts, his involvement was less protracted than Gacumbitsi. A life sentence was held to be the appropriate sentence there. We say that this case is worse than Kamuhanda. If the mode of liability of committing were to be struck out, it would not materially affect the sentence; life imprisonment is still the appropriate sentence. Thank you, Your Honour. </p>

In that case, you may recall that we reversed the conviction for committing genocide, but found Radislav Krstic liable for aiding and abetting. The view of the Appeals Chamber in that case, was that this change in convictions required a certain reduction in the sentence. Since you cited one case, I thought it would have been helpful to ask if you would have referred to those two.

            <p>We are obliged to you, Mr. President, Your Honours. Our submission will be done by Madam Mbattang. Now, if we can cut down on the time allotted to us, I would see if I could say just one more thing, Your Honour. </p>

            <p>Good afternoon, Mr. President. Good afternoon, Your Honours of the Appeals Chamber. Mr. President and Your Honours, I could have directly addressed the issues raised by the Prosecutor, but I felt right from the morning today -- or I was made to understand that all the concerns raised by the Prosecutor focussed on increasing the sentence of Mr. Gacumbitsi, and that's why I would plead with you, despite the urgency of time, I would plead with you to take you back slightly to what occurred in Rwanda, just to point out, Mr. President, Your Honours, just to point out that Mr. Gacumbitsi is not the person they would want you to believe that he is. So, Mr. President, Your Honours, I will slightly sum up what happened in Rwanda. Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi's Defence, as I told you earlier, will slightly dwell on the circumstances of the tragedy that befell Rwanda. If I may, I would like to draw the attention of your Chamber to the fact that after the death of President Juvénal Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994, Rwanda was caught in the throes of some formidable violence. And that's why right from the 7th of April, killings occurred more or less everywhere in the country, and particularly in the north. Mr. President, Your Honours, right from the 7th of April, as I stated earlier, following the death of President Habyarimana, killings started, more or less, all over the country. We will attempt to prove, Mr. President, that the entire country was riddled with unrest. The same situation did not occur in Rusumo commune. It was only as from a certain period; in other words, as from the 10th of April 1994, that there were some killings in the commune under the jurisdiction of Sylvestre Gacumbitsi. Mr. President, Your Honours, if Mr. Gacumbitsi was a person who sought to kill all the Tutsis, he wouldn't have waited for the 13th, because the Prosecutor told you this morning that it was as from the 13th of April 1994, that Mr. Gacumbitsi started to execute Tutsis. I was, therefore, saying, Mr. President, just to point out to you when the killing started in Rusumo commune, well, I did say that it started on the 10th of April. And it is established, it is proven, Mr. President, Your Honours, that as from the 7th, for instance, in the northern part of the country, killings had started. And, Mr. President, it was only towards the 12th that some other killings occurred in the Rusumo commune. I would even tell you subsequently that whenever such killings occurred, Mr. Gacumbitsi intervened and did what had to be done. Mr. President, now, in the afternoon of the 12th of April 1994, where Mr. Gacumbitsi had ordered the arrest of some Hutus who had killed Tutsis in the night of the 10th to the 11th, and the 11th to the 12, just to put them in the jail, as a bourgmestre, he was threatened by some extremists from the Rukira commune. And when he was threatened -- when they went to threaten the sous-préfet because Gacumbitsi was described as an accomplice of the Tutsi, well, this sous-préfet subsequently had to release the offenders. You will be told that he participated in the killings on the 13th, that he engaged in excitement on the 14th. We did tell you, Mr. President, in our briefs that when he was threatened, he went into hiding, and as from the 13th he was not seen again. And we are therefore saying, Mr. President, that Mr. Gacumbitsi is not the person being described by our friends on the other side. And it is my view, Mr. President, that what we are going to say to you will demonstrate that Prosecution did not provide evidence for you, as it were, to increase the penalty that you've handed down on Mr. Gacumbitsi and to prevent him from returning to meet members of his family. I was therefore saying, Mr. President, that we have detailed all these facts before the Trial Chamber. We have provided evidence to demonstrate the innocence of Mr. Gacumbitsi. In spite of that, there was a judgment that was delivered on the 17th of June 2004, sentencing Mr. Gacumbitsi to 30 years' imprisonment for genocide, rape, and extermination. Mr. President, Your Honours, both parties appealed against that judgment. My lead counsel has had occasion to explain to you -- Mr. President, I was saying that my lead counsel has amply explained to you the errors committed by the Trial Chamber. And if this is correct -- these are corrected, Mr. Gacumbitsi can go back to his family. The Prosecutor also lodged an appeal and it raised six grounds. The Prosecutor raised six grounds in his appeal. Mr. President, I was saying, the Prosecutor set out six grounds comprising errors in law, errors in fact, and my lead, Kouengoua, will attempt to explain to you the evidence which will enable you to disallow whatever the Prosecutor has said. That would be on the sentence. And I, Mr. President, I will be dealing with murder, rape, the joint criminal enterprise, and the application of Articles 6 <stage>(1)</stage> and 6 <stage>(3).</stage> So let me start with -- let me start -- Mr. President, Your Honours, let me start with the second ground on which the Prosecutor lodged an appeal. In this regard, the Prosecutor claims that the Trial Chamber committed an error of law by failing to find Mr. Gacumbitsi, the Respondent, guilty of the murder of Marie and Beatrice. In Paragraph 59 of his Appellant's brief, he states that Trial Chamber III committed two errors by concluding that there was no evidence susceptible to corroborate the statements of Prosecution witnesses -- Witness TAS, and by failing to take into account a second piece of information which is the basis of the criminal responsibility, namely, that the Respondent allegedly aided and abetted the commission of the murder of Marie and Beatrice. Before we respond to the submissions of the Prosecution, the Defence believes that a knowledge of the circumstances of the fact would be a useful point. Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Appeals Chamber, in April 1994, Marie was a Tutsi, was a tenant of the Respondent in one of his buildings situated at the Nyakarambi market. She was not the only Tutsi; several other Tutsis lived there in that building, amongst whom were witness -- Prosecution witnesses -- Witness TBC. History will teach us that before the events of 1994 -- April 1994, there was some misunderstanding between the two races or tribes, and that close relationships between a Tutsi and a Hutu was not very well considered. And the Accused, Mr. Gacumbitsi, was the only one to be blamed for the fact that he was a Hutu and he should not be housing Tutsis in his building. These facts were reported to the Trial Chamber by Witness TBC, as can be seen in the transcripts of the 5th August 2003, paragraphs 1 to 7 on page 70. So I was saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, despite these blames heaped upon the Accused, he continued to house Tutsis in his building: Marie, TBC, and other Tutsis, especially those who had fled troubles in their own areas and had sought refuge in Rusumo. As I had said earlier, Your Honours, the Tutsi <stage>(sic)</stage> extremists did not think kindly of the fact that this Accused person here present should provide housing for Tutsis. This is why, Mr. President, Your Honours, that in the morning of 13th April 1994, the Accused received a message, a threatening message from the head of the Interahamwe in Rukira commune. And what did the message contain? In the message, he was being told that if he does not send away Marie and all the Tutsis who were living in his building, that evening those Tutsis would be killed and his house -- his building would be destroyed. In a panic, the Accused went to his tenants to inform them of that threatening message he had just received and to ask the same Tutsis to go and seek safety, either by leaving the country or by finding another shelter where they would not be easily found. So those are the circumstances, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Appeals Chamber. Therefore, it is not the version given to you by the other side, knowing that when the Accused sent away the Tutsi tenants from his building it was because he was trying to prevent them from being killed. As I was saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, when he went to inform his tenants about what may happen to them, TBC fled. He immediately left in order to find refuge elsewhere. Marie also left in order to join her sister who was living not far away from there. Mr. President, Your Honours, it is during that same night that she and her sister were killed. The Prosecution was aware of what was happening because there was a factual witness who came before the Chamber to testify, and this is YEW, Witness YEW, a Defence witness. YEW stated before the Trial Chamber that these two Tutsi women were killed by two bandits. This was one Kirenga and another Kigaki. Let me go a little bit back because I made a mistake on the pseudonym of the witness. It was Witness UPT during the hearing of 16th October 2000, and it's at paragraph 182. Now, if the trial Judges had before them an eyewitness, would they have sought elsewhere for other reasons to justify the fact that it was the Accused who killed Marie and Beatrice because of their ethnicity, because they were Tutsis? Let me explain to you, Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Gacumbitsi, who physically looks like a Tutsi, would not have been able to kill these women. And if he did want to do so, if he was the one who had incited Tutsis to be killed, Mr. President, Your Honours, do you think that knowing that Tutsis were living in his building, would he have waited for the 12th, for the 13th, whereas killings had already began on the 7th? Mr. President, I believe that if we are to look for a reasoning, a humanitarian or legal reason, one cannot state, Mr. President, Your Honours, that Mr. Gacumbitsi was the perpetrator, is responsible for the double murder of these women. And it is rightly so that the Trial Chamber found that the Accused Gacumbitsi was not guilty of that murder. This is furthermore true because the Prosecutor was aware that its submissions were no longer holding water; it had recourse to the provisions of Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute by alleging that the Respondent aided and abetted the murder of Marie and Beatrice, and this is something that could not have been done, given the submissions made above. The Prosecution does not prove that the conditions to find someone guilty or responsible for such a murder has been found. A superior must have de jure or de facto authority to prevent the subordinate from committing a crime or enable the superior to punish the offender after their commission of the crime. Has the Prosecutor in the case been able to demonstrate that the bandits here were subordinates of the Respondent? If so, how could they be? The role of the bourgmestre is to ensure the protection of the people living within his administration. The Prosecutor has also failed to adduce evidence that the Respondent had the material ability to prevent the commission of the crime or to punish the principal perpetrators of the crime. Similarly, the Chamber must be convinced of the effective control over his subordinates at the time of the events. The Prosecutor, in paragraph 106 of the Appellant's brief, alleges that the Respondent exercised considerable power, authority and influence in the commune to such an extent that the Tribunal should find the Accused responsible for the murder of Marie and Beatrice. As I was saying a moment ago, he could not do this. He did not know -- I believe that at the time when he was telling them to leave his building, he could have asked them to refrain from staying in the town. Mr. President, on this point, I would wish to say that the Prosecution submission do not hold water, and you should therefore dismiss the submissions of the Prosecution because they are not founded. Let me move to the third ground of the appeals, dealing with other rapes committed in Rusumo commune. Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not know whether I should take too much more of your time on this particular ground. We have all today seen in this Chamber the difficulty the Prosecution had in order to sustain his own allegations. For me not to waste your time unnecessarily, I will not go into the matter of TAQ. I think principal counsel -- lead counsel already spoke at length on that, but I would like to speak on TAP, TAO and TAS. And this is what you are being asked by the Prosecution: To take into account the fact that the rapes took place during a widespread or systematic attack. But we are all jurists, we are all lawyers, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Appeals Chamber. We all know that the Prosecution must provide evidence, the legal and factual evidence which proves that for each case, each crime for which the Accused is charged, must be proven. And now, what is the other side saying, apart from TAP -- TAQ's rape? First, you are told that this was in a widespread and systematic attack. Even if that had been the case, had there been one rape before -- after the incitement, that would be considered within the responsibility of the Accused because it happened within the framework of a widespread attack. Now, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not believe that this crime should be considered in that view. I am saying, Mr. President, that your honourable Chamber, you and your colleagues have your own principles. Incitement to rape can only be constituted if the person accused of the incitement did the incitement at a given point, and following that incitement, a rape was committed. And I would say, Mr. President, there is established jurisprudence before this Chamber, and let me take the case of Laurent Semanza. Because in that case -- in the case of Laurent Semanza, what exactly happened? Mr. Semanza held a meeting, and during that meeting, he incited Hutus to rape Tutsi women. Immediately after that meeting, one of those who had attended the meeting went and found a Tutsi woman who was hiding in a room, and raped her. So, Mr. President, this is to tell you that contrary to what has been submitted by the other side this morning, it requires a need -- a link between the incitement and the commission of the rape. In this instance, each case of rape should be treated separately and discreetly. This is not the same as in the Semanza case. It had been alleged that another woman had been raped and the person who had done the rape was doing what had followed the incitement by Mr. Laurent Semanza. But in this case, Mr. President, you were maliciously made to believe that all cases of rape took place in Nyarubuye secteur. I am saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, that TAS never lived in Nyarubuye secteur. Furthermore, when we know what happened to TAS, I think that TAS was from Kigina secteur. And TAS said -- in his statements of the 5th August 2003, TAS said she was raped on the 14th of April 1994, by the brother or cousin of the Accused. Mr. President, the Prosecution said from the other side that the rapist used the same language as the Accused here present used in Nyarubuye on the 17th April 1994. I'm saying that if we were to base ourselves on words which are used, these words were used everywhere in Rwanda. So, therefore, all those who were arrested and prosecuted should be sentenced for rape -- convicted for rape. Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm saying that the allegations made against the Accused here present took place on the 17th, and it would be impossible that this incitement which encouraged the -- those who raped TAS on the 14th of April 1994, would have been impossible because that was three days earlier. I do believe that I would encourage you to apply the principles which should be applied to the rape of TAS. It would seem that this lady, who was raped by the conseiller of the secteur of Nyarubuye, we do not know on what date, but before she was raped, apparently the Accused had incited people to rape. The same is for TAP. I must say that she did live in Nyarubuye secteur, but we do not know on what date she was raped. It's not clear. As required by jurisprudence, which you apply all the time, this is not followed in the two cases; in other words, the link between the incitement and the rape of TAS, TAO, and the mother of TAP. And I'm saying that the Prosecutor is being very malicious because the Prosecutor has not given a date, and this is purposely -- purposely done. Because in other statements, all precise information is provided, including dates. So I'm saying, Mr. President, Your Honours, that if we are applying principles regarding incitement and rape, as in the Semanza case, you will not be able to grant the request being made by the Prosecution. If there has not been any incitement, I do not wish to go as far as saying that the Prosecutor needs to prove that incitement substantially concurred with the perpetration of the rapes that are imputed to the perpetrators of the rape. Mr. President, Your Honours, the time that has been allotted to me is going so fast that I need to look into my brief which -- our Appellant's -- our Respondent's brief, and I will send you to paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. </p>

            <p>This morning the Prosecutor found itself on shaky ground and they then went to discuss joint criminal enterprise, but I think we will come to this under ground five of the appeal and the same will apply, Mr. President, Your Honours, to the Accused's responsibility as a superior, Mr. President, Your Honours. So, we will conclude with these grounds to say that the Prosecution has failed to adduce evidence that the Accused is responsible for the rapes of TAS, TAP and TAO and, therefore, I pray that this commission be dismissed for failure of any grounds. With regard to the fourth ground of appeal, I shall not go back over that, as we are not prejudiced by it. We believe the Prosecution did that in the instance of justice to shed light on the issue, namely, if we should take into account the victim's consent or lack of consent. Let me now move onto the fifth ground of appeal. In the fifth ground -- in the fifth ground of appeal the Prosecution criticises the Trial Chamber for refusing to allow them to rely on joint criminal enterprise as a basis for the individual criminal responsibility of the Accused person. Mr. President, Your Honours, in our respondent's brief we made submissions regarding everything we thought about that ground of appeal. We had discussions this morning. They were right in line with our brief, which you certainly have before you. We said, and the Prosecution this morning acknowledged as much, that their indictment was vague, unspecific; they even went further then that to say that they did not take into account certain matters because the indictment is defective. What can we do with a defective indictment, is it null? No argument, therefore, as this is null and void, can be drawn from it and certainly cannot be a basis of conviction of the accused person. This is simply a matter of procedure. Earlier, and I've just repeated it, the Prosecution felt that their indictment was faulty. And what did they say? Yes, even if the indictment is defective, and, therefore, null and void, we can use other materials that came in afterwards; namely witness statements, for example; pre-trial briefs; and opening statements. What does the opening statement explain? What are the witnesses going to explain? In those circumstances, Mr. President, Your Honours, we made substantive arguments against that ground, and I was going to refer you to our previous submissions. But I should like to draw your attention to the fact that if, after a defective indictment becomes null and void, we can then fall back onto other materials? I believe such an approach would amount to serious violations of legal standards and norms. This is the law that, first and foremost, must be applied. What does the law tell us? It sets out the conditions that are required to make an indictment valid. This is in Article 17 of the statute and Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. No one is authorised to amend the law as regards those letters. As such, Mr. President, Your Honours, we believe that you cannot grant the Prosecution's request. They seem to have asked you to apply principles and jurisprudence which arose later, after they failed in their approach to attempt to correct the indictment with other materials during trial. You were given a response this morning, knowing that this could not be applied in this case. And a decision was made prior to the decision that they wanted to base their arguments on. As such, we submit that the Chamber, at trial, correctly applied the law. I'm referring to paragraphs 169, 284, and 314 of the Trial Chamber judgement. Looking at that, the Prosecution's request should be denied, taking into account my submissions in our brief. Let me now move on, Mr. President, to ground number 6 of the Prosecution's appeal. On this ground the Defence submits that the Trial Chamber in the impugned judgement at paragraphs 169, 284 and 314, as I mentioned before, gave a relative analysis of the individual criminal responsibility by applying provisions of Article 6 of the Tribunal Statute. I don't want to move backwards, Mr. President, but, in fact -- and, in fact, in this sixth ground, what does the Prosecution tell us? He repeated this morning that it is sufficient to make statements in a given environment and if you are a superior or someone who has influence over the population or authority over them, everything and everyone in that context are your subordinates. This was the Prosecution's argument, but is it a reasonable one? Mr. President, it cannot be a de facto superior, but you must be superior, the jury, rather. The law does not provide conditions to be a superior of someone. If that is not provided for, how can you imagine, in a given group and a given environment, that all of the people there fall under the person who has influence over them or authority over them? If we were ready to admit, to allow such an assertion it would be wrong. A superior has to have control over their subordinates. I say the subordinates must report back to them and tell them everything they do; then the superior can take measures to punish those who commit infractions or offences. If we put ourselves in the context spelled out by the Prosecution, would it be reasonable? And let me take the case of the Accused person here before us. Everyone acknowledges, we were told, when there were incidents in his commune there were refugees from other communes. Did he control them? Did he ever see them? And the trial showed that they were the ones who committed the crimes. Should this be attributed to the Accused? People arrived, people incited, were given orders; everyone there, were they the subordinates of the influential person in the commune or in the préfecture? One moment's indulgence, please. Mr. President, Your Honours, let me repeat what the Prosecution said, to demonstrate how this is impossible. They, themselves, acknowledge this. The Accused arrived in the certain secteurs. He made some statements. On the basis of what he said, people committed crimes. They call that incitement. Your Honours, just because you are a superior or because you have authority over some people, you say something in a certain context, everything said and everyone there are your subordinates. That's incorrect, in Gahina or elsewhere. The Accused here spoke to the people living in those cellules and secteurs and the Prosecution calls that incitement. Your Honours, subordinate relationship has not been established. Just because you are a bourgmestre or minister or préfet in a country or given place, on the basis of that, Mr. President, the Prosecution's arguments do not hold water. For that reason, please refer to our previous submissions in writing. The appellant has failed to adduce the necessary evidence that the Accused was a superior of the Interahamwe, who weren't even in his commune; of the gendarmes, who were not assigned to his commune; of the préfets, who were not in his commune; and other civilians who were Hutus. Otherwise, the préfets, the bourgmestres, the ministers, would have to follow every single citizen in their areas. That reasoning doesn't hold water, Mr. President, Your Honours. I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that the Prosecution has failed to adduce the necessary evidence which would allow you to uphold the conviction of the Accused or to confirm the decision that was taken. For that reason, Mr. President, we request that you deny the motion by the Prosecution in its entirety. We ask you to closely read all of the submissions in writing given to you by the Prosecution and by our side. I had some submissions in closing, but as lead counsel wants to deal with the first ground of appeal, with your leave, I would ask him to address that, now, and come back with a closing address. Since lead counsel would now like to deal with the first ground of appeal, I have nothing more to add.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Mr. President, thank you. Very quickly, following Counsel Mbattang, I want to come back to the first ground of the appeal broached by the Prosecutor. I am responding to that lastly. I was adequately edified, Mr. President, you see, I was telling you yesterday -- I repeated it this morning -- but I was not understood. Your jurisprudence is what you're building and what you're constructing. That's why you are here spending holidays listening to us, and when we bring an accused to you, you are being told that your jurisprudence is what you need to apply, Mr. President, Your Honours. That is not what you are here for. And when you are being asked to do what we did not do, we end up being in the wrong. And since this is the rule, as the Prosecutor has said, I propose that I follow the rule and I take the violation, the judgement -- because to acquit Bagilishema -- the Trial Chamber said that the bourgmestre, the bourgmestre, préfet was accused for having failed having stopped or prevent the massacres, the killings. Did he have the powers? Now, Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi, did he have the means with which to prevent the killings? Mr. President, up to the 13th of April he was the powerful leader of the commune, and this is because he began by arresting Hutus and the wrongdoers who had threatened him with death. If Gacumbitsi had not arrested those people, maybe he would never have been threatened. And when death -- even when he started to arrest the wrong doers and putting them in jail, he began to be afraid and he began to hide. This happens to anybody, presidents, lawyers, préfets, because physically we are only human beings. I may have said, like the religious say, the clergy say, that we are all returned to dust. Gacumbitsi is, apparently, being accused by the Prosecutors for having killed, because if Witness TBC, which was his close friend *****************, and he's the one who said this, if <stage>(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed, under seal)</stage> had taken time and was safe, it is because when Gacumbitsi received threats from Tesa <stage>(phonetic),</stage> an extremist, of the Birhinga Interahamwe who came to say that he was going to come to kill all the Tutsis for helping and then he will come back and kill him. He went to tell his friend. People said he had let them go without them knowing. But put yourself in his place, his driver, his tenant, spent their first night in the house of Gacumbitsi's first sister, eldest sister. How can he ask TBC, his friend, and his driver, and other tenant, to go and flee and seek refuge in his *****************************. That lady came here and she said as much. The same was admitted by TBC. But I'm being told no, he committed savage crimes in other sites. And in the final analysis, the Prosecutor, in all fairness, quoted the Kamuhanda jurisprudence, said there were errors made but they said that they were the same age, that Gacumbitsi was born in 1943, Kamuhanda was born in 1953, a difference of 10 years Your Honours. I even heard somewhere it said that Gacumbitsi started to run. I hope, Mr. President, that when you give him an opportunity to speak, he will be able to tell you. I don't know what his athletic qualities are, but as far as I know, his lead counsel have never been informed of his athleticism. This is a man who saved his people. This is a man who stopped the killings, the massacres, of people who were threatening him with death, because there is something which is referred to as the omission of providing assistance. Now, he did not omit to provide assistance and it is said in <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> that you cannot be prosecuted because your own life was not in danger. Gacumbitsi started from the 7th to the 13th. From the 13th it was not only the population, he himself was afraid and he began to hide. Apart from Nyarubuye site, and this is where I understand the Prosecutor, if there is no Nyarubuye, there is nothing else which will remain standing. Savage crimes, and I say this is the only trial I have in Rwanda. The Prosecutor has many sites in Nyarubuye. Now, many people fled to Nyarubuye because it was one of the last communes where there was still peace and where there was still safety and security and this was thanks to the courage of the Accused. Although it was limited, Gacumbitsi had that courage. Maybe in Nyarubuye people were killed, but I'm telling you that Gacumbitsi was not among the attackers. And in the final analysis, what could this lone man do against the extremists? What this single man could have done against the killers? Can one organise, plan, participate in a joint criminal enterprise with his partners and then arrest them at the same time? This happened to the extent that there were refugees in Rwanda, even as far as Tanzania. If these other sites mentioned by the Prosecutor were to be listed, we would never be speaking about this now. </p>
          </sp>
          <stage>(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) said something extraordinary in cross-examination, "I would not lie about this, Gacumbitsi did not know how to handle weapons. I would not lie about that." And this was at the hearing of the 21st August 2001. He will not lie, and that's what he said. But I do say that he lied about other things, because he said that "My parents wanted me to become a civil servant and not a driver of a commune and Gacumbitsi did me wrong. He didn't do anything good for me. I left him a letter when I left, but he didn't respect what I asked him, so if Gacumbitsi was the criminal," the witness says, "I left a letter for his son, Marcel, to give to Gacumbitsi." And this comes out in all the statements of this key witness of the Prosecution, who continually says -- even TAW mentioned a whole list of things, but when he was asked when he left Gacumbitsi in the market at 1300 hours, what driver was left with him, and he said that he went to look for a driver who didn't have a job and he didn't find any. Where was Sebudandi, Philippe if he was, indeed, the commune driver at the time?Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi is not a criminal. And I believe, not like the Prosecutor said, because he said, apart from -- if you don't increase his sentence, at least remain with the 30 years you've given him. But I'm asking you something else, very humbly, because your jurisdiction enables you to determine with wisdom, with humanity, given the circumstances in the case, to determine the sentence which goes or corresponds with each situation, but the involvement of Gacumbitsi, had that been possible, had that been in existence from March to July 2003, up to 2004, January, when Trial Chamber rendered its judgement, then Gacumbitsi, because of the facts is given 30 years. Today we are being asked that the sentence be increased and decisions in 2005 are being quoted. Mr. President, Your Honours, and this is where I will conclude, no other document can replace the indictment. Article 50 says -- Rule 50 says, once it is confirmed, any amendment must be made through you. Any amendment must be made through a judgement. If you remove one letter, that power which is given to you, you will be ceding it to the Prosecutor and tomorrow you will hear that although the name of the Accused does not appear, there was disclosure three weeks after the conviction, and you will say that this was what is being done. But you should not allow this to be done. Before its confirmation, any amendment can be made, but once it is confirmed everything has to go through you. And one cannot say, "Oh I amended this," or "I used the witness to say this," or "I had a pre-trial brief." What is the intent of all this, in order to amend the indictment? No, the law has stated the amendment, as to confirmation, had to go through you and no one else can do you in your stead. And I am speaking to you. I tried this in 2001, 10th of November 2001. Just after I was committed, I tried to have the indictment amended, and I was told that I could not do so. Although I went to the Chamber, the Prosecutor prevented me from doing that, but he himself preferred to have communication disclosure and use witnesses and not go through the correct proceedings. Now, if I refer to the expert witness produced by the Prosecutor, I insist that whether you are asking for the increase of the sentence, we are going to stick to the truth. Alison Des Forges said that there were deaths at the Nyarubuye parish, but that there were less than 1,000. But this doesn't mean much in terms of genocide. The numbers don't really matter. But when the Prosecutor, today, says two or three years later says that a thousand people were killed at the parish, I am saying that we do not need to go that way. I don't know where this information is coming from. At any rate, as far as I'm concerned, I don't know about this information. I didn't receive disclosure. And in regard to what I have followed, it is supposed the expert knows better than everybody else regarding the events that took place. Mr. President, Your Honours, Gacumbitsi, believes in international justice. His Defence team, also, and we sincerely thank you on that note.</stage>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Just one question, Mr. Kouengoua, you have made interesting submissions to the effect that Mr. Gacumbitsi has no criminal responsibility for committing genocide in relation to the death of Mr. Murefu and you have, likewise, made submissions to the effect that he has no criminal responsibility in respect of the death of Marie Beatrice. Now, assuming that this Bench were to uphold your submissions, would anything remain of the conviction for genocide or will something remain, and if so, what? </p>

            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, for your question, Mr. President. The Defence never intended to request the Chamber to find that there was genocide or not. That's not before us. However, what we are saying, the fact Gacumbitsi did not kill anyone, even the people whose identity we don't know. If we had simply said that Gacumbitsi decimated all of the population in Rusumo it would be up to the Prosecution to qualify that, but they gave you the names of 14 people. Those 14 people were set aside by the Chamber. But Murefu was mentioned -- but for Murefu, they said that he -- on three occasions they said he committed the murder personally. It's up to the Prosecution to say why they did not put Murefu's name in the indictment. How are you, Your Honours, going to know that if Murefu existed and he was a Tutsi. If they don't give all of the details they should at least let us know the person, allegedly, killed was a member of the targeted group. Mr. President, what I am requesting, I'm telling you that Gacumbitsi was not there on the 15th, on the 16th, on the 17th, and certainly not on the 14th. He was in hiding. Given that, you have the authority to assess that. We are requesting that you acquit Gacumbitsi. The Prosecution has asked for a conviction. We have the scales of justice. It's up to you, Mr. President. It is up to your Chamber to rule to make a finding. The Prosecution and us simply give you the evidence. We try to clarify our positions in a certain matter. Beyond that, we have no other authority, Your Honour. We have those limitations on our level.</p>

            <p>Mr. President, besides the death of Murefu, as I've been saying yesterday, with regards to the crime of genocide, there was the rape -- case of rape, there was extermination, but still with regard to Murefu, again in Nyarubuye, the only witness who was raped, who testified, was TAQ and TAQ recognised the accused's driver. Unfortunately, during the events, he was no longer working. Perhaps she was mistaken, but the witness did not see the Accused. She only saw the driver. That's the big paradox here, Your Honour.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE SCHOMBURG:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. I only wanted to give you a possibility to respond, because that's what has been discussed this morning. There is no doubt that a valid indictment is also the prerequisite for trial. However, it's a submission of the Prosecutor that on 16 May 2003 the Prosecutor filed its pre-trial brief and attached to this there was a witness statement in which it was stated that the Accused killed Mr. Murefu, a Tutsi. I don't want to go into details, this statement was distributed and it was linked to count 1 and count 2, that is genocide and complicity to genocide and to extermination. May I ask you, is it correct that you received this pre-trial brief the 16th of May? How did you react? In particular, did you contact the witness from which you got the statement prior to the opening of the trial and what was -- if so, what was the result of your own investigation in relation to this allegation. Thank you.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kouengoua">
            <speaker>MR. KOUENGOUA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Your Honours. Your Honours, what the Prosecutor has told you is his version. To answer your question, let me give you my version. The Prosecutor is not a genie or a genius. He can make a mistake. He is quite human. He can have an indictment drafted without having information which later comes to him and, therefore, can be used to beef up the indictment. Let's take TAO and TAQ. TAO was heard on the 15th May -- 15th of April 1998. April 15, 1998, I repeat. Four years to the day after the alleged acts and he never spoke of Murefu, unless what was disclosed to me was not true. And he never spoke of Murefu. Witness TAQ was heard on the 9th November 2000, one year before the indictment, but, Mr. President, Your Honours, so many years have passed, I know you get information, you want at what cost, but since he is a bourgmestre, like Akayesu he must also go to prison. You amend the indictment, and you want to bring it here. In the pre-trial brief, statements were given. There must be proof that there was no other possibility to do better. But if the trial began, and I apologise for the way I'm speaking, I am having to use these terms. If this was started with all these difficulties, I assure you that there was a lot of concealment and I had difficulty in dealing with the Prosecution. And when we were told that the diplomatic pouch arrived on Saturday and three or four months later this document was available, we say that there is something not right. And when the indictment was drafted all this information was there, but I had never seen anything about it. I had been cut off. No rapes. These are such acts which are so serious that one cannot forget them four, five, six years later on. Mr. President, let me take you back, but maybe this is not my role. I shouldn't even do this, but in my situation imagine the Accused tells you he had forgotten, he would be lying. If the Accused said, "Oh, Mr. President, I've forgotten," he would be lying. But when it is Prosecution witnesses, we find all manner of artifice because one thing that is certain in this procedure the principle is the incarceration. The principle of innocence is rather an exception because if that had been the case, with all the enormous powers that the United Nations have placed at the disposal of the Prosecutor, he had all the time. Gacumbitsi was in a refugee camp. He could not disappear. He was picked like a flower and he said that he was taken from the camp quite simply and then he was brought here. I think a criminal would have taken steps to hide himself. A criminal would have taken precaution to plan. He should have also looked at his possible flight, and he was not doing that. We see the contrary. Let us look at what elements we have, what information we have. He did not flee and the people who, allegedly, in the documents that were sent, were available for years after the events, and he did not speak about Murefu. This is how come the Prosecutor is being asked how are you going to speak about this person if you did not included him in the indictment? I thank you for having given me the opportunity to speak.</p>

            <p>My question is just this, is it correct what Defence counsel submitted, that Prosecution knew already four years before filing the indictment in the case before us and the witness was heard one year beforehand and the first question would be, why wasn't the name of Mr. Murefu included in paragraph 12 of the indictment and, second, do you know whether or not Defence contacted this witness? So this could be seen as an expression of being informed in a timely fashion, but this is, of course, for the Chamber to decide.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-weston">
            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Of course, Your Honour, dealing with the first aspect of your question, drafting of paragraph 12 of the indictment, I regret that I'm unable to assist the Chamber as to why it was drafted in that manner. I did not know the reason why it was drafted that way, and I cannot give any evidence from the Bar why it was drafted in this manner. The fact of the matter is, that we left with the submissions which the Prosecution already made regarding disclosure of material in the pre-trial brief. That is as far as I can take the matter. </p>

Apparently not related to the concrete indictment. And why didn't you, with a view to this, amend the indictment? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-weston">
            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Well, again I cannot speak for the way in which the trial Prosecutor conducted his case, as to why it was thought it -- it was thought not necessary to seek to amend the indictment. So I cannot take that matter any further. However, what we do have is the information regarding the event in question, the killing of Mr. Merefu, was disclosed, we submit, to the Defence in a suitably timely fashion. There was no objection taken by the Defence to the admission to that evidence, and no objection taken by the Defence during the trial to the form of the indictment.

            <p>Just give me one minute. Yes, if I may, I would like to follow up on the question of my distinguish colleague, Judge Schomburg. You will notice -- may I remind you that Judge Schomburg focussed on the question whether -- why the indictment was not amended, or no attempt was made to amend the indictment on a matter of such importance. Now, the annex -- the annex, which lists the name as Mr. <stage>(unintelligible),</stage> was annexed to the preliminary pre-trial brief in support of the submission. And this was supposed to cure the lack of the disclosure in the original indictment. Now, what is not clear to me is, given the major importance of naming the names here, how to explain that this was included in the annex, and there was no mention to that in the brief itself? If you want to direct the attention of the Accused to something, do you just mention it in an annex? Why don't you mention it in the brief? Then the onus would have been much greater on the Accused to respond to that. I realise you were not involved in writing those documents, but unfortunately you are the only addressee to whom we can turn with our questions. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-weston">
            <speaker>MR. WESTON:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, thank you, Your Honour. That -- I appreciate what Your Honour has just said. The -- at the risk of repetition, the Prosecution can place it no higher than this: That, whilst it was unfortunate and -- that those details were not pleaded in paragraph 12 of the indictment, we -- our position is maintained that there was sufficient disclosure of this material, in the form of the witness statements, which show that there was evidence given of the time and place of the killing of Mr. Merefu. That material was disclosed to the Defence prior to the trial on -- given the very concise nature of the Prosecution case regarding the events at the parish, it would have been apparent to Defence counsel, if I may say so, that the evidence was going to be relied upon by the Prosecution. Now, if there was going to be any prejudice suffered by the Defence in the preparation of its defence, or if there was any suggestion that the Prosecution case was not being pleaded in an unambiguous manner, there would have been ample time for the Defence to have taken various points of law. They could have either asked for an adjournment to fully investigate the matter, if they thought it was necessary. They could have objected to the reception of the evidence because it was not properly pleaded in the indictment. Those matters were not done. The evidence was led without objection. We submit that, that being so, and given the particular facts of this case, there can be no resulting prejudice to the Accused. Your Honour, that is probably, to some degree, a repetition of statements which have been made by this end of the bar table earlier today. However, that is as far as the Prosecution can take the matter. </p>

            <speaker>SYLVESTRE GACUMBITSI:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you for allowing me to address the Court. If I take a couple of minutes more, I would apologise to you. The Rusumo commune, right up to 1994, was a haven of peace. On the 8th of April 1994 my colleagues, the other bourgmestre and myself, attended a meeting of the security committee for the préfecture. That meeting was chaired by the préfet of Kibungo; his name is Godfroid Ruzindana. The agenda was to map out strategies to ensure that there is peace and security throughout the préfecture following the death of the president. The recommendations made after the meeting had to be conveyed to the population of the commune promptly. That's what I did on the 9th of April. And I brought together the conseiller de secteur for the commune. And let me inform you that diverse political parties were represented at that communal meeting. Now, at that meeting I did insist that, in their respective secteurs, there not be any unrest; that they had to ensure that there is security. Now, the recommendations of that meeting -- that is at the préfectural level -- were broadcast over the national radio station. A tape that was disclosed to us, together with my diary, wherein those recommendations were entered, were disclosed to us as exhibits by the Prosecutor. I wish to insist, Mr. President, Your Honours, that the Rusumo commune never had any Interahamwe militiamen, and no distribution of weapons occurred there. In fact, this was denied by witnesses for the Defence and those for the Prosecution, including TBH. Mr. President, Your Honours, I fought the criminals on the 10th, the 11th, the 12th, and the 13th of April. I went to assist people in a secteur <stage>(sic)</stage> called Nyamugali, <stage>(unintelligible),</stage> Gatore, and Kigarama where there was unrest. Their houses were burnt; some people were injured, and some others were killed. I was able to arrest and jail those criminals. I held security meetings to condemn criminals, wherever they came from. And even those who attended the meeting condemned those criminals, because they had brought shame on the secteur, in particular, and on the commune in general. I was able to recover the properties that were looted from the Gatore centre, and they were restored to their owners. This was evidence before Trial Chamber III, together with the exhibits in support. Mr. President, Your Honours, after doing all of these, I was threatened with death by the criminals that I imprisoned. The sous-préfet of Kirehe released them after being threatened by their acolytes, who had conspired against me and threatened to destroy any- and everything if they were not released. Since this Kibungo central prison yard was not working anymore, the sous-préfet told me they had been released in the hope that he would pick them up when peace was restored. Now, these criminals threatened me with death and blamed me for jailing the Hutus in order to protect the Tutsis. They said the Sous-Préfet Habyarimana and the Bourgmestre Gacumbitsi -- myself -- were accomplices of the RPF. They blamed me for accommodating the Tutsi in myself at the Nyakarambi centre, and that, by the way, I looked like a Tutsi. They openly stated that, at the first opportunity, I would be physically eliminated. I also was threatened with death by a certain Cyasa, an extremist, a leader of an Interahamwe group based at the Birenga commune. He sent someone from the Interahamwe to come and warn me. At the Nyakarambi centre they said that Gacumbitsi was accommodating Tutsis in his house, and he had to explain how his house had become the CND. That surprised me. I felt pain that my judgment 17 June 2004, Trial Chamber III, did not take into account my diary wherein I had entered what I did right up to 13th of April, combatting the criminals and protecting the Tutsis. That diary was found in the refugee camp after my own expected arrest and detention by the Prosecutor. I arrested criminals in a manner known, and even seen, by each and everyone. These are matters that are verifiable. Eyewitnesses confirmed before this Court that as bourgmestre -- and I even said this in my diary -- I had nothing to blame myself for, and I had nothing to <stage>(unintelligible).</stage> After all this stress, well, I said to myself, prevention is better than cure. And I went, and I alerted my -- the people who were renting my house, including Marie and other Tutsis, of the Rukira and Birenga commune, who were seeking refugees -- refuge there. And I asked them to leave. I told them that I was threatened, and I did not want to see them being mistreated, or put to death there. One of those *********************************** TBC, a Prosecution witness, confirmed this before Trial Chamber III. Everybody left, sought refuge in Tanzania. And the next day I learnt that Marie went and joined her younger sister, Beatrice, in some other house rather than the one she was renting at the centre. Defence witnesses testified here as to the manner in which those women were killed. Let me insist, Beatrice was never someone staying in my house. Those who sought refuge in Tanzania went back to Rwanda, and they are still alive. TAW also told me that he was afraid, and that he wanted to run away. And I told him not to hesitate because the situation was becoming increasingly unbearable. He left with his wife and children. ***************** and his family. They spent the night at my elder sister's house. My elder sister lived at Ngara in Tanzania. Fear is a human feeling. Mr. President, Your Honours, as I stated, these criminals who wanted to kill me were like mad people. People of their ilk could kill me. They were unscrupulous people. As I told my boss at the time, as from the evening of the 10th of April, I started -- I went into hiding for fear of being killed. I was of no significance to those criminals. And let me add that anyone who felt afraid, or worried, could go across Kagera river and seek refuge in Tanzania without a hitch. And among them there are those who came here to confirm what I'm saying before the Court. Mr. President, Your Honours, I am not a killer. I did not kill anyone. I have never incited anyone to practice evil on his neighbour. If there were planning, as it is claimed, to kill the Tutsis, I wouldn't have arrested and jailed extremist Hutus who burnt houses, injured and killed people. If I had intended to kill the Tutsis, I would have started with my driver, who was always with me, right up to the afternoon of the 13th of April. Or, I could have killed him right from the 7th of April, since I knew every Tutsi in my commune, as well as where they lived. Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor blames me for the fact that during the meeting of the conseiller de secteur on the 9th of April 1994 I incited them, so that they go and hold meetings, grouping only Hutus to kill their brothers and sisters, the Tutsis. This is absolutely impossible. I insist, it is indeed impossible. Holding a meeting of just one ethnic group of the population in secteur, or a cellule, where Tutsis and Hutus were always together, lived together and shared everything? Something else, at the cellule level, there was a five-member committee, including the leader of the cellule. And there was somebody -- someone responsible for a group of ten houses to ensure security. All these leaders at the grassroots level comprised Tutsis and Hutus. Let me say this to you -- I'm saying this to you just to prove that such a meeting that was selective, as claimed by the Prosecutor, could not hold <stage>(sic).</stage> Mr. President, Your Honours, as the Prosecutor claims, did I incite the Hutu to kill Tutsis, and then subsequently arrest and jail them? It would be incomprehensible. Let me not fail to tell you, also, that in the month of April, Rusumo commune welcomed several thousands of refugees from Byumba and Kibungo préfectures. Rusumo was the only commune where one would feel secure, with the advance of the RPF. On the 28th of April, that is when those soldiers moved in -- officially into the Rusumo commune. All those refugees, together with a huge number of the Rusumo population, both Hutu and Tutsi, went on the path to exile towards Tanzania. At the end of April 1994, RPF closed the passage of refugees over the Kagera bridge towards Tanzania and occupied the entire Rusumo commune. Mr. President, Your Honours, allow me now to speak about the refugees at the Nyarubuye parish, on which a great deal has been written. During the security -- during the préfectural security committee meeting on the 8th April, there was mention made of disturbances in communes which led to the displacement of people who were under threat to other, safer, areas. It is these refugees who were seen coming to Nyarubuye parish from the north -- in the north of Rusumo commune before the 15th of April 1994. When they arrived, the inhabitants of commune -- Rukira commune, which is a neighbouring -- Rukira commune, which neighbours Rusumo, began to threaten these people in Nyarubuye secteur, from the 13th April, because they had welcomed Tutsis from elsewhere. It is public knowledge that on the 14th April 1994, the inhabitants of Rukira commune attacked Nyarutunga cellule from the Nyarubuye secteur, through Birembo, to the north-west of the parish. Thanks to the togetherness of the Tutsis and Hutus of Nyarubuye secteur, these invaders were repelled. But, later on, they came back with gendarmes from the Mulindi centre in Rukira commune. They attacked Hutus and Tutsis who were gathered at the Nyarutunga centre in Nyarubuye secteur, and the gendarmes disbursed after having killed some of them. On the 15th of April, late in the afternoon, the Gendarmes came back, without warning, with civilians from the Rukira commune and from other regions, and they attacked the refugees at the parish. They had commandeered vehicles from traders at the Mulindi trading centre in Rukira commune in order to transport the assailants. The convoy was reinforced by other vehicles from Kibungo. They came, picking up other people on their way. When they arrived at the parish the attackers killed the refugees and quickly returned to their homes using the same route. Eyewitnesses who were present at the attack on the parish came to make statements before Trial Chamber III. Others who participated in the attack are in prison in Rwanda now. They made their own confession and pleaded guilty before Rwandan courts. And they clearly stated that the attacks on the church were led by gendarmes based in Rukira commune. All these witnesses and prisoners never ever said that Gacumbitsi directed the killings at the parish. I have always said that these evil-doers who killed the refugees at the parish came from outside Rusumo commune. If my trial had not been expeditious, I would have been able to present further eyewitness witnesses who are Hutu and Tutsis. These refugees were safe at the parish. They had no problems. They were having food and they were having no difficulty with the local population, although they were many in number. Since I was living far from Nyarubuye parish, and because I had always been in hiding from the evening of 13th April 1994, I was like a swollen ball -- a deflated ball. I -- someone -- a civilian from Nyarubuye commune, one Neza, came to tell me very early on the morning of the 16th, 1994. But since he didn't find me in the commune office, he came to my home. After this sad news, my heart went beating and I spent a moment of silence. I was extremely shocked. The sous-préfet of Kirehe was also informed of this sad, unexpected event. Prosecutor -- Prosecution Witness Fergal Keane, the journalist of the BBC, went looking for me in the refugee camps in <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> in Tanzania -- in Tanzania to ask me how the refugees at the Nyarubuye parish were killed. I explained to him that I did not -- that he had misunderstood. I told him that he should go to the Red Cross in order to find out what really had gone on at the parish, and he refused. I protested against what this journalist was doing, and I wrote to the director of the BBC, but there was no answer to my protest. A copy of that letter was together with my personal effects in the refugee camps, and I have a few of those effects. Mr. President, Your Honours, when -- with the -- the Almighty God, may he live in the hearts of men because he is the supreme witness. I was living in the Nyarubuye parish, and the communal office was very far. There was no telephone, neither at the sous-préfectures, neither at the commune office, nor even at the parish. I could not imagine that these gendarmes, based in Rukira commune, and foreign civilians, would come to my commune to attack refugees who were living peacefully at the parish, such as others who had assembled in other secteurs. It should be noted that, given the situation at the Rusumo commune office, people could leave the neighbouring commune in order to come and do things in this area, in the north, without the bourgmestre knowing. To the bottom of my heart, I have said truthfully what happened in April 1994, and the truth will always conquer lies. Furthermore, I am inclining <stage>(sic)</stage> myself before the victims of the war which befell Rwanda from 1990. I also incline -- I bow before the victims of all ethnic groups, and I condemn, seriously, the ravaging of my beautiful country, Rwanda. Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to conclude by begging you, sincerely, to review my situation in all justice and all fairness. I am convinced that justice is there in order to punish the guilty, but also in order to free the innocent. I am in no doubt that your august chamber will render justice by acknowledging my innocence which I have continually reclaimed <stage>(sic),</stage> right from the beginning, and which all honest people from Rusumo and Rukira communes have confirmed, without any hesitation. Mr. President, Your Honours, I thank you sincerely for having given me your attention. </p>

            <p>Now, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will now deliver its judgment in the case of the Prosecutor v. Sylvester Gacumbitsi. In this case the Appeals Chamber was presented with appeals by both the Prosecution and the Appellant, Mr. Gacumbitsi, from the judgment of the Trial Chamber, Trial Chamber III, rendered on 17 June, 2004. During 1994, the Appellant was the bourgmestre, that is to say the highest-ranking local administrative official of Rusumo Commune in Kibungo Préfecture in Rwanda. The Trial Chamber convicted the Appellant of genocide as well as extermination and rape as crimes against humanity and sentenced him to 30 years' imprisonment. These convictions were based on events taking place in Kibungo Préfecture, including the massacre of Tutsi refugees at Nyarubuye parish. In summarising today's judgment of the Appeals Chamber I will proceed first to the Appellant's grounds of appeal, and then through the Prosecution's. Please note that this oral summary does not constitute any part of the official and authoritative judgment of the Appeals Chamber, which is rendered in writing and will be distributed to the parties at the end of this session. In addition, I would like to say that not every point in the Judgment will be mentioned in this summary, which will focus on the main issues. I shall invite my colleagues to help me with the reading of this summary, and so I turn first to Judge Güney. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-güney">
            <speaker>JUDGE GÜNEY:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. I will start to proceed with the Gacumbitsi appeal, the interlocutory decisions, first ground of appeal. Under his first ground of appeal, the Appellant challenges a number of procedural decisions made by the Trial Chamber over the course of the trial. First, he challenges a decision issued on 25th July 2002 concerning the specificity of the Indictment against him. He argues that the Trial Chamber should have held that the Indictment's references to acts committed "on or about" a certain date violated his rights under Article 20 <stage>(4)</stage>
              <stage>(a)</stage> of the Statute. The Appeals Chamber rejects this sub-ground of appeal. The dates of specific incidents alleged in the Indictment are for the most part provided with sufficient precision. As to certain other incidents, the dates are less specific. But none of the Appellant's convictions depended on the incidents described in these paragraphs, so any vagueness in this regard, even if constituting a defect has not prejudiced him. Furthermore, the Appellant does not contest the Trial Chamber's holding that the Pre-Trial Brief cured any vagueness in paragraph 36 of the Indictment. The Appellant next challenges the decisions of the 28th of July 2003 and 28th August 2003 rejecting his requests to postpone the commencement of the trial and of the defence case respectively. The Appeals Chamber notes that trial scheduling is subject to the Trial Chamber's discretion and that the Appeals Chamber will only reverse scheduling decisions upon a showing of abuse of discretion rendering the trial unfair. The Appellant had not made such a showing. He agreed to the starting dates in question, and moreover does not show that he was allotted insufficient time to prepare his defence. His defence team had billed thousands of hours before the trial and had contacted over 2,000 <stage>(sic)</stage> witness. The Appeals Chamber rejects this sub-ground of appeal. Next, the Appellant -- the Appellant challenges the Trial Chamber's Decision of 1st of August 2003 concerning a disclosure matter. However, he has not shown that the material he claims should have been disclosed even existed. The Appeals Chamber rejects this sub-ground of the appeal on this respect. Finally, the Appellant challenges the Trial Chamber's decisions of 11 and 18 November 2003 concerning certain proposed expert witnesses for the defence. The 11 November decision admitted into evidence the report of two experts, Professor Lecomte and Dr. Vorhauer, and held that they did not need to testify because the Prosecution had waived its right to cross-examine them. This determination was in accordance with Rule 94 bis and the Appellant shows no error in it. The Decision also denied the status of expert witnesses <stage>(sic)</stage> to another proposed expert, Mr. Ndengejeho, and excluded his proposed report but allowed him to testify as a fact witness. The Appeals Chamber agrees with the Appellant that the Prosecution's Motion for Exclusion of Expert itself was untimely according to Rule 94, bis. However, nothing in that rule implies that, absent a timely motion from the party opposing an expert, a Trial Chamber is obligated to admit expert testimony. Rather, the determination of whether an expert witness is qualified is subject to the Trial Chamber's general discretion under Rule 89 concerning matters relating to admission of evidence. The Trial Chamber thus had discretion proprio motu to reject Mr. Ndengejeho's qualifications as an expert. The Appellant has furthermore not shown that the Trial Chamber abused its discretion in concluding that Mr. Ndengejeho's background did not qualify him as an expert under the circumstances of the case. Finally, the Appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced by the exclusion of the report. For these reasons, the Appeals Chamber dismisses the Appellant's first ground of appeal in its entirety. Now, I will proceed with Gacumbitsi appeal, genocide ground of appeal number 2. Under his second ground of appeal, the Appellant brings several challenges to his conviction for genocide. First, he claims that the Trial Chamber, in holding that genocidal intent can be inferred from his acts and their factual context, failed to apply the requirement of dolus specialis or specific intent. The Appeals Chamber sees no error. The Trial Chamber properly noted that under Article 2 <stage>(2)</stage> of the Statute the Prosecution must prove that the accused possessed the specific "intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such ". The Tribunal's jurisprudence conclusively established <stage>(sic)</stage> that this intent can be proven through inference from the facts and circumstances of a case. Here, the Trial Chamber reasonably held that the Appellant's numerous public statements urging the mass killing and rape of Tutsis were sufficient to establish his genocidal intent beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant further argues that the Trial Chamber improperly relied on the "acts of other perpetrators" to prove the Appellant's genocidal intent. But the Trial Chamber in fact relied principally on the Appellant's own actions and utterances. The Trial Chamber did cite "the scale of the massacres" in support of its finding that the Appellant "acted with intent to destroy a substantial part of the targeted group", but this, too, is consist with the established jurisprudence. The Appeals Chamber dismisses this sub-ground for appeal. The Appellant's second legal challenge to his conviction for genocide pertains to the Trial Chamber's finding that he personally killed a Tutsi civilian, Mr. Murefu, and thereby "committed" genocide. The appellant argues that this killing was not alleged in the Indictment and as such should not have been the basis of a conviction. The Appellant is correct that the killing was not mentioned in the Indictment. The Appeals Chamber, by majority, Judge Shahabuddeen and Judge Schomburg dissenting, finds that this constituted -- this constitutes a defect in the Indictment. When the Prosecution seeks a conviction based on a particular incident in which the accused personally, physical perpetrated a crime, it must plead the material facts related to that incident in the Indictment. The Appeals Chamber holds that it did not do so here, and so the Indictment was defective. However, the Appeals Chamber unanimously upholds the Appellant's conviction for "committing" genocide. This is for two different reasons reached by differently constituted majorities. First, the Appeals Chamber, Judges Liu and Meron dissenting, holds that any defect in the Indictment's pleading of the killing of Mr. Murefu was cured by the Prosecution's submission of a Chart of Witness, annexed to its Pre-Trial Brief, in which the summary of the proposed testimony of Witness TAQ detailed the material facts concerning the killing of Mr. Murefu and specified that the witness's testimony was in relation to the genocide charge. Thus, the Prosecution provided "timely, clear, and consistent information" sufficient to put the Appellant on notice of the charges against him. Under established jurisprudence, this is sufficient to cure a defective Indictment. Second, the Appeals Chamber, Judge Güney dissenting, also holds that even if the Appeals Chamber were to set aside the killing of Mr. Murefu, the remaining factual findings of the Trial Chamber would be sufficient to support a conviction for "committing" genocide. The crime of genocide does not consist merely of killing, and an accused can participate directly and physical in genocide without personally killing another individual. The Trial Chamber found that the Appellant was present at the scene of the Nyarubuye massacres and personally supervised them, including separating the Tutsi refugees from the Hutu so that they could be killed easily. Taken together, these actions, which were clearly pleaded in the Indictment, amounted to "committing" genocide through direct participation. Next, the Appellant raises a number of challenges to the findings of fact underlying his conviction for genocide. Many of these amount to mere claims that the Prosecution's witnesses were not credible, that there were minor discrepancies in their testimony, or that their testimony contradicted evidence introduced by the defence, without showing that the Trial Chamber was unreasonable in crediting them. Others are based on a misunderstanding of the Trial Chamber's holdings or reasoning. The Appeals Chamber's reasons for rejecting each of these factual challenges are detailed in the Judgment and need not be discussed here. For the foregoing reasons the Appeals Chamber dismisses this ground of appeal in its entirety. </p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Judge Güney. I shall now ask my distinguished colleague Judge Liu to count with the Appellant's third ground of appeal. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-liu">
            <speaker>JUDGE LIU:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. The third ground of appeal, crimes against humanity, extermination. Under his third ground of appeal, the Appellant challenges his conviction for extermination as a crime against humanity. The Appellant first argues that "[t]he mental element must be proved by the existence of a widespread practice, which implies planning and tolerance of such act by the State." The Appeals Chamber rejects this contention. The existence of a policy or plan can be evidentially relevant, but it is not a separate legal element of a crime against humanity in general or of extermination in particular. The same can be said of "tolerance of such act by the State." The Trial Chamber properly found that for crimes against humanity "the accused must have acted with knowledge of the broader context of the attack, and with knowledge that his act formed part of the widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population." It further found that his actions from the 15th to 17th April, discussed above with respect to the genocide count, revealed his "intention to participate in a larger scale massacre in Nyarubuye", which is sufficient to establish the requisite mental state for extermination. It also found that the appellant took steps between 8 and 15 April 1994 to plan the extermination of Tutsis in Rusumo Commune. None of the Appellant's arguments demonstrate an error in these findings of fact. The Appellant next argues that the Trial Chamber should not have convicted him for extermination because the Prosecution failed to prove that the individuals specifically mentioned in paragraph 28 of the Indictment were killed at Nyarubuye parish. The Appeals Chamber disagrees; such a showing was not required for an extermination conviction. Although paragraph 28 of the Indictment lists certain specific victims, it explicitly does not -- sorry, it explicitly does so only by way of example. The Appellant was not convicted of personal <stage>(sic)</stage> "committing" extermination. The material fact for his conviction for planning, instigating, ordering and aiding and abetting that crime was that many refugees were killed as a consequence of the Appellant's orders or instructions. This was pleaded in the Indictment and supported by the Trial Chamber's findings. The Appellant reiterates many of the factual challenges discussed above with respect to the genocide count, and points to additional supposed contradictions in the testimony of Prosecution's witnesses. In the Appeals Chamber's view, these are explained by differences in vantage point or are relatively minor, and the Appellant has not shown that the Trial Chamber erred in crediting the witnesses' testimony. Likewise, the Appellant has not shown that the Trial Chamber erred in discrediting the contrary testimony of defence witnesses, or that it used unfair and double standards in assessing the credibility of witnesses. The Appellant challenges the estimates given by witnesses Fergal Keane and Alison Des Forges as to the number of the people killed at the Nyarubuye parish. Even if this argument is correct <stage>(which the Appeals Chamber need not decide)</stage> the Appellant has not demonstrated how the variation in the numbers would affect the Judgment. For these reasons, this ground of appeal is dismissed in its entirety. Crimes against humanity: Rape, <stage>(Ground of Appeal 4).</stage> Under his fourth ground of appeal, the Appellant challenges his conviction for rape as a crime against humanity. First, he submits that the rapes in question were not committed in the course of a widespread and systematic attack because there was no "deliberate act or plan", in that the Prosecution did not prove the existence of preparatory meetings. As noted above, a "plan" is not a required element. The Trial Chamber correctly elucidated the definition of "widespread or systematic" established by the Tribunal's jurisprudence. The Appellant also argues that Article 3 <stage>(g)</stage> of the Statute is directed at crimes of a collective nature, whereas the evidence in this case established, at most, individual or isolated acts of rape. But it is not rape per se that must be shown to be widespread or, systematic, but rather the attack itself <stage>(of which the rapes formed part).</stage> This criterion was met here. Second, the Appeals Chamber rejects the Appellant's contention that the rape of Witness TAQ was isolated, and moreover that he could not have instigated it, because she knew her attacker previously. The genocide and extermination campaign in Rwanda was characterised in significant part by neighbours killing and raping neighbours. As the ICTY Appeals Chamber has recognised, even in the event that "personal motivations can be identified in the defendant's carrying out of an act, it does not necessarily follow that the required nexus with the attack on a civilian population must also inevitably be lacking". Nor does it follow that the Appellant could not have instigated the rape; the question in that respect is whether his actions substantially contributed to the crime. The Trial Chamber correctly applied these standards in light of the totality of the evidence, and the Appellant has demonstrated no error. The Appellant raises certain other factual challenges dealt with in more detail in the Judgment, but has not shown that it was unreasonable to rely on the testimony of Witness TAQ or other Prosecution witnesses. For these reasons, this ground of appeal is dismissed in its entirety. Sentencing <stage>(Ground of Appeal 5)</stage> The Appellant submits that his sentence could be reduced to 15 years setting forth various arguments about aggravating and mitigating circumstances in his Appeal Brief. However, in his Reply Brief, he expressly concedes the Prosecution's point that he has not demonstrated any error on the Trial Chamber's part. He explains that he did not intend to articulate a ground of appeal with respect to the sentence or to assert error, but rather to request that the Appeals Chamber reduce his sentence on "humanist" grounds. The Appeals Chamber rejects this request. It is well established that the Appeals Chamber will not substitute its own sentence for that imposed by the Trial Chamber absent a showing that the Trial Chamber has committed a discernable error in exercising its discretion or has failed to follow applicable law.Part II, the Appeal of the Prosecution. In discussing the Prosecution's appeal, I will begin with the second ground of appeal and return at the end to the first ground of appeal concerning the sentence. Murder as a crime against humanity, the second ground of appeal. The Trial Chamber found that on the 13th of April 1994, the appellant expelled two of his Tutsi tenants Marie and Béatrice, from their home, and that they were killed later that night. However, the Trial Chamber considered these findings insufficient to establish the Appellant's responsibility for their murder. The Prosecution first argues that the Trial Chamber erred in not finding that the Appellant ordered the tenants' murder, and specifically in failing to place the testimony of Prosecution Witness TAS, which the Trial Chamber dismissed as uncorroborated hearsay, in the context of a <stage>(sic)</stage> wider genocidal campaign that was unfolding and the Appellant's participation in it. The Prosecution claims that this circumstantial evidence supports a conviction for "ordering" murder. The Appeals Chamber finds first that the Trial Chamber did not misunderstand the law. It did not suggest that there was an absolute legal barrier to relying on uncorroborated hearsay but held that under the circumstances the testimony in question was insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Prosecution has not demonstrated that it was in error.Second, the Appeals Chamber has found that the Prosecution has not shown that, based on the circumstantial evidence, no reasonable Trial Chamber could have failed to conclude that the fact that the Appellant ordered the tenants' murder was established beyond a reasonable doubt. This sub-ground of appeal is therefore dismissed. The Prosecution next argues that the Appellant should have been convicted for aiding and abetting the murders of Marie and Béatrice. The Trial Chamber did not discuss this theory; the Appellant claims this is because the Prosecution failed to plead or argue it at trial. By majority, the Appeals Chamber <stage>(Judge Güney and Judge Meron dissenting),</stage> holds that the aiding and abetting theory was pleaded in the Indictment, that the Trial Chamber erred by failing to consider it, and that it should have convicted the Appellant of aiding and abetting murder. The preamble to Count 4 of the indictment lists aiding and abetting among the ways that the Appellant committed murder. This is in the course of quoting the provisions of Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute, which is the Prosecution's longstanding practice. The Appeals Chamber finds this language sufficient when taken in combination with subsequent paragraphs of the Indictment that detail the necessary material facts to support an aiding and abetting allegation; it notes that the Indictment must be taken as a whole. Paragraph 36 states: On a date uncertain during April - June 1994, 		Sylvester Gacumbitsi personally ordered the 			tenants in one of his homes to vacate the premises. 	After announcing that his home was not CND, a reference to the cantonment of RPF soldiers in 		Kigali, Sylvester Gacumbitsi ordered the killing of 	his former tenants. Although the second sentence of this paragraph alleges that the Appellant directly ordered the killing, the first sentence alleges a distinct and lesser step - expelling the tenants from their home - that, taken into the context of other allegations in the Indictment detailing the ongoing genocidal campaign, amounts to aiding and abetting murder. Moreover, although the Trial Chamber did not enter a conviction for aiding and abetting murder, it did enter findings of fact sufficient to support such a conviction. It detailed the expulsion of the tenants, the statements of the Appellant, the context of the genocidal campaign, and the Appellant's involvement therein, and the killing of the tenants, and concluded that "the Accused expelled his tenants, Tutsi women, knowing that by doing so he was exposing them to the risk of being targeted by Hutu attackers on grounds of their ethnic origin." On the basis of these findings of fact, the Appeals Chamber, by majority, will enter a new conviction for aiding and abetting murder. This sub-ground of appeal is upheld. Responsibility for rapes committed in Rusumo Commune the third ground of appeal. Although the appellant was convicted of eight rapes under Count 5 of the Indictment, the Trial Chamber acquitted him of certain other rapes. Under its third ground of appeal, the Prosecution argues that the Trial Chamber erred in law by requiring it to establish that the Appellant's instigation was a condition sine qua non of the commission of the rapes. </p>

            <p>The Appeals Chamber agrees with the Prosecution that there is no such requirement, but finds that the Trial Chamber did not hold otherwise. It simply said there had to be a "causal connection", general language that is consistent with the correct requirement that instigation must have substantially contributed to the crime. In this case, the Trial Chamber found no evidence of a link between the Appellant's words and the rape in question; that is, no link of any kind whether a substantial contribution or a sine qua non. There was no error of law.The Prosecution next argues that the Trial Chamber erred in fact by failing to conclude that the Appellant's instigation substantially contributed to all of the alleged rapes. The Appeals Chamber disagrees. The Prosecution did not prove that the rape of Witness TAS, as well as the rapes of Witness TAP and her mother, took place on or after 17th of April 1994, the date the Appellant drove around in the secteur instigating rape. As to the rapes recounted by Witness TAO, the Prosecution did not establish that the only reasonable conclusion based on the evidence was that the perpetrators were aware of the Appellant's utterances of 17th April 1994.For the same reason, the Appeals Chamber rejects the Prosecution's alternative theory that the Appellant aided and abetted the rapes in question. As with instigation, with aiding and abetting the Prosecution must prove that the acts of the Accused substantially contributed to the commission of the crime. It failed to do so.The Prosecution, finally, argues that the Appellant should have been convicted for those rapes under Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> of the Statute, and challenges the Trial Chamber's holding that the Appellant lacked superior authority over the perpetrators. It argues that the Trial Chamber erred in law by requiring proof that the Appellant was a superior in a formal administrative hierarchy, rather than examining whether he exercised effective control.The Appeals Chamber notes, first, that even though the Appellant was convicted for some rapes under Article 6 <stage>(1),</stage> it is, nonetheless, appropriate to consider whether a conviction for other rapes should be entered under Article 6 <stage>(3).</stage> In this regard, the Trial Chamber held that there was no evidence of a superior-subordinate relationship. The Trial Chamber, indeed, focussed exclusively on the Appellant's de jure authority and his position within a formal administrative hierarchy, but the Appeals Chamber has held that a superior possesses power or authority over subordinates, either de jure or de facto; it is not necessary for that power or authority to arise from official appointment.The Trial Chamber, therefore, erred in this respect.Nonetheless, the Appeals Chamber cannot conclude that, had the Trial Chamber applied the correct legal standard, it would have convicted the Appellant. The Trial Chamber's finding of fact referred to the Appellant's general authority as bourgmestre to impose law and order in the commune, as well as his leading role in the genocidal campaign.Yet, it cannot be extrapolated from these findings that he exercised effective control over every person who was present in the commune during the time in question. And the Prosecution advances no arguments concerning effective control over the particular perpetrators. This ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. The Prosecution's fourth ground of appeal seeks a clarification of the law relating to rape as a crime against humanity. It argues that non-consent of the victim and the perpetrator's knowledge thereof should not be considered elements of the offence that must proved by the Prosecution; rather, consent should be considered an affirmative defence. It argues, inter alia, that when rape occurs in the context of genocide, armed conflict or a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population, genuine consent is impossible.Although this issue did not affect the judgement, the Appeals Chamber considered it on the grounds that it is a matter of general significance for the Tribunal's jurisprudence. It wishes to distinguish between two related questions: first, what are the elements of rape; second, how may those elements be proven?The Appeals Chamber considers that the first question was settled by the Kunarac, case in which the ICTR Appeals Chamber held that rape consists of certain acts of sexual perpetration occurring without the consent of the victim and with the knowledge that it occurs without consent the victim. Thus, non-consent and knowledge thereof are elements of rape and must be proven by the Prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. This is distinct from an affirmative defence approach in which the Accused would bear, at least, the burden of production.Although Rule 96 of the Rules does not refer consent -- does refer to consent as a defence, the Appeals Chamber agrees with the Trial Chamber in the Kunarac case, that the term "defence" in Rule 96 is used in a non-technical sense. Rather than changing the definition of the crime by turning an element into a defence, which the Rules of Procedure have no power to do, Rule 96 simply redefines finds the circumstances under which evidence of consent will be admissible. Thus, it speaks to the second question: how may non-consent be proven?The answers both Tribunals have given to the second question resolve, as a practical matter, the objections raised by the Prosecution with respect to the elements approach. The Prosecution can prove non-consent beyond reasonable doubt by proving the existence of coercive circumstances under which meaningful consent is not possible. It is not necessary for the Prosecution to introduce evidence concerning the words or conduct of the victim or her relationship to the perpetrator; nor, need it introduce evidence of force. Rather, the Trial Chamber is free to infer non-consent, as well as knowledge thereof, from the background circumstances. Indeed, the Trial Chamber did so in this case.For these reasons, the Appeals Chamber dismisses this ground of appeal.The Prosecution's fifth ground of appeal concerns the Appellant's liability for murder, genocide, extermination and rape under basic and extended theories of joint criminal enterprise, or JCE. The Trial Chamber held that JCE was not pleaded clearly in the indictment.The Prosecution first argues that paragraphs 22 and 25 of the indictment alleged JCE sufficiently by stating that the Appellant acted in concert with others in pursuit of a common scene, strategy or plan. The Appeals Chamber notes that this language pertains only to the genocide count; the Prosecution points to no analogous language under the other counts.In Kvocka, the ICTY Appeals Chamber established that a JCE theory must be pleaded in the indictment or the indictment is defective. Neither this nor any other precedent establishes that the exact words "joint criminal enterprise" must be pleaded, however. The language must simply be sufficient to provide fair notice to the Accused. The Appeals Chamber holds that the words "acted in concert with" are not sufficient, if taken alone. But under some circumstances, an allegation that the Appellant acted in concert with others in pursuit of a common scene, strategy or plan, as alleged in paragraph 25 of the indictment, would be sufficient to plead a JCE theory, if taken together with allegations of the material facts necessary to support such a theory.However, the Appeals Chamber, by majority -- Judge Shahabuddeen and Judge Schomburg dissenting -- holds that in the context of this indictment, the language was not sufficient. After using that language, paragraph 25 proceeds to state that the Accused participated in the common scheme by his own affirmative acts, or through persons he assisted, or by his subordinates, with his knowledge and consent. This language could be read to invoke three established modes of liability other than JCE: committing through direct personal perpetration; aiding and abetting; and, Article 6 <stage>(3),</stage> superior responsibility. The Appellant could have interpreted the paragraph, taken as a whole, to refer only to those modes of liability and not to JCE, and he thus did not receive clear notice of the JCE theory. This is especially so because, at the time of the indictment, JCE was still an unfamiliar mode of liability in this Tribunal, although it had been employed at the ICTY.Andefect in an indictment may be cured by the Prosecution's submission of timely, clear and consistent information. The Prosecution argues that it cured any defect in this case through its pre-trial brief; however, that brief did not provide any clear indication to the Appellant that he was being charged as a JCE participant. It nowhere referred to a joint criminal enterprise, a common criminal purpose, strategy, design or scheme, or even acting in concert, and in no other way gave any indication that the Prosecution was pursuing a JCE theory. Likewise, the defect was not cured by the Prosecution's reference in its opening statement to acting in concert with others as part of the common scheme.This statement was not further developed or connected to specific factual allegations that supported the JCE claim; nor did it specify to which category of JCE it meant to allude. For a subsequent submission to be understood to clarify vagueness in an indictment, the implications of that submission must be clearer than the Prosecution's statement was here.Only in its closing brief did the Prosecution provide further details on its JCE theory, and that submission obviously came too late. Accordingly, by majority, the Appeals Chamber holds that the Trial Chamber did not err in refusing to consider the JCE theory, and this ground of appeal is dismissed in its entirety.The Trial Chamber found that the Appellant ordered crimes committed by the communal policemen, but did not find that he ordered crimes committed by the conseillers, gendarmes, soldiers and Interahamwe in his commune. Under its sixth ground of appeal, the Prosecution argues, first, that the Trial Chamber erred in law by requiring proof of a formal superior-subordinate relationship in order to find that the Appellant had the authority or power to order. The Appeals Chamber agrees with the Prosecution that ordering does not require the existence of a formal superior-subordinate relationship, but the Trial Chamber specifically recognised as much in paragraphs 282 and 283 of its judgement. After finding that no formal superior-subordinate relationship existed, the Trial Chamber proceeded to consider whether, under the circumstances of the case, the Appellant's statements nevertheless, were perceived as orders.The Trial Chamber did not err in law.Next, the Prosecution alleges that the Trial Chamber erred in fact by failing to conclude that the Appellant had the necessary authority and that his statements were perceived as orders. The Appeals Chamber agrees.The Trial Chamber found that, as bourgmestre, the Appellant was the highest authority and most influential person in the commune, with the power to take legal measures binding on all residents. His role in the genocide demonstrated his authority: he convened meeting with the conseillers; asked them to organise meetings to tell them to kill Tutsi, and verified that these meetings had been held; and directly instructed conseillers, other leaders, and the Hutu population to kill and rape Tutsi.The Trial Chamber pointed to several instances in which the appeal -- the Appellant instructed, ordered or directed the attackers, in general, not just the communal policemen. These findings made clear that the Appellant had authority over the attackers in question and that his orders had a direct and substantial effect on the commission of these crimes.On the basis of the Trial Chamber's own findings, no reasonable trier of fact could have concluded otherwise. The Appeals Chamber notes that the present case is not materially distinguishable from the Semanza case, in which the Appeals Chamber reversed the Trial Chamber's failure to enter a conviction for ordering, and the Kamuhanda case, in which the Appeals Chamber affirmed the entering of such a conviction.Accordingly, this ground of appeal is upheld.We now return to the Prosecution's first ground of appeal on sentencing.First, the Prosecution claims that the Trial Chamber should have considered the Appellant's use of the communal police as an aggravating factor. The Appeals Chamber finds that the Appeals Chamber already implicitly did so when it considered the Appellant's abuse of his powers as bourgmestre, to which it gave weight. The Appeals Chamber finds no discernible error.Second, the Prosecution argues that the Trial Chamber erred in considering the fact that the Appellant's formal status as a superior was confined to the communal police. As the Appeals Chamber has overturned this finding above, it will take this error in account in its consideration of the sentence.The Prosecution submits, next, that the Trial Chamber accorded undue weight in mitigation to the Appellant's prior good character and accomplishments. It argues that, if anything, these are aggravating factors since, as the Trial Chamber found, the Appellant abused the trust he had earned through his prior good character and his position as bourgmestre, and that, in any case, these factors are of no importance in light of the Appellant's crimes. The Appeals Chamber recalls its dismissal of similar arguments in the Semanza case and finds that, under the circumstances, there is no evidence that the Trial Chamber abused its direction by giving these factors excessive weight.Third, the Prosecution asserts that the Trial Chamber erred in considering that the good relationships of the Appellant's family with its neighbours constituted a factor in mitigation. The Appeals Chamber agrees. While there is no exhaustive list of what constitutes a mitigating circumstance, the fact that the Appellant's family has good relationships with its neighbours of all ethnic groups cannot be considered to constitute an individual circumstance of the Appellant, and should not be considered in the sentencing. Nevertheless, it is unclear what weight, if any, the Trial Chamber gave to this factor.The Prosecution also submits that it is hardly a mitigating factor that the Appellant's active involvement in the events was of short duration. The Trial Chamber, however, did not consider this as a mitigating factor, but merely noted that the duration of the Appellant's involvement was not so long that it might constitute an aggravating factor. The Appeals Chamber sees no error in this observation.The Prosecution contends that the Trial Chamber committed an error by failing to impose a sentence reflecting the gravity of crimes and of the Appellant's degree of criminal culpability. It submits that the Appellant deserves the highest penalty available at the Tribunal.The Trial Chamber properly stated the legal principles on which the Prosecution relies. After noting that the crimes committed were very serious, it stated that the penalties should, first and foremost, be commensurate with the gravity of the offence, and that secondary or indirect forms of participation are generally punished with a less severe sentence.Nonetheless, the Appeals Chamber agrees with the Prosecution that the Trial Chamber failed to apply these principles properly in the present case in imposing a sentence of only 30 years' imprisonment on the Appellant. The Appeals Chamber recalls that the Appellant played a central role in planning, instigating, ordering, committing and aiding and abetting genocide, and extermination in his commune of Rusumo, where thousands of Tutsi were killed or seriously harmed.The Trial Chamber also found the Appellant guilty of instigating rape as a crime against humanity, noting that the Appellant had exhibited particular sadism in specifying that, where victims resisted, they should be killed in an atrocious manner. The Appellant was thus convicted of extremely serious offences. Moreover, unlike most of the other cases in the Tribunal in which those convicted of genocide have received less than a life sentence, there were no specially significant mitigating circumstances.The Appeals Chamber is fully cognizant of the margin of discretion to which Trial Chambers are entitled in sentencing. This discretion is not, however, unlimited. It is the Appeals Chamber's prerogative to substitute a new sentence when the one given by the Trial Chamber simply cannot be reconciled with the principles governing sentencing at the Tribunal. This is such a case.The Appeals Chamber concludes that, in light of the massive nature of the crimes and the Appellant's leading role in them, as well as the relative insignificance of the purported mitigating factors, the Trial Chamber ventured outside its scope of discretion by imposing a sentence of 30 years' imprisonment only. The Appeals Chamber, therefore, upholds this sub-ground of the Prosecution's appeal.</p>
