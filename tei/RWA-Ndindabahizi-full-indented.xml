          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>I am grateful, Your Honour.Your Honours, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi stands before you today, charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, for the murder and extermination of Tutsi civilians, in and around his home commune of Gitesi in the prefecture of Kibuye in Rwanda.Needless to say, Your Honours, these crimes are some of the most heinous of crimes known to mankind. The Defence will have Your Honours believe that the widespread, systematic and sustained attacks on Tutsi civilians throughout Rwanda in l994 resulting in the said genocide, was a spontaneous outburst of communal hatred triggered by the downing of the president's plane as it approached Kigali airport on 6th of April 1994.The Prosecutor will however, represent to Your Honours, that the attacks on Tutsi which occurred in Rwanda during the said period was conscious, meticulously planned, and orchestrated at the highest level -- at the highest official level. The Prosecutor will further represent to Your Honour, that the killing of Tutsi was a result of the strategy, the essence and objective of which was a systematic elimination and extermination of all Tutsi in Rwanda, in effect, leaving none to tell the story.Your Honours, simple logic would suggest that given the magnitude of the killings, it was virtually impossible for such mass killings to have been committed within 100 days without the direct involvement of the state. In that regard, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's case that the opposition of the extremist Hutu in power at the time to the power-sharing agreement reached in the Arusha Accords, led to the formulation of an extremist "Hutu-power" ideology within Rwanda.Two Prosecution witnesses, Your Honours, GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges, will testify that although the interim government established following the president's death was composed of five of the six political parties in Rwanda, in reality the said government essentially comprised of politicians who were selected from the extremist factions of the respective political parties, many of whom were opposed to the power-sharing agreement.Your Honours, indeed, the majority of the politicians who formed the said government werenon- extremists. However, there were some politicians amongst them who had no known history of extremism, but rather, were mere opportunists brought into the said government without any real political power, but rather, as a façade to establish a broad-based government.Your Honours, the Defence will have you believe that those politicians who had a known history of extremism were indeed more likely to have a motive to commit these heinous crimes than the politicians who belonged to the known moderate parties such as the PSD. They would argue that such politicians, the moderates, simply have no case to answer. In that regard, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honour, that factors such as past or present political affiliations had little or nothing -- absolutely no bearing on the sad events which form the basis of this trial.Witness GKH will describe to Your Honour how, from 7th April 1994, three categories of politicians existed in Rwanda: those who were seen as obstacles to the genocidal government and were eliminated; the second category, those who fled the country in the knowledge of what was about to happen and did not want to be seen to be part of it; and the third category, those who remained and chose to participate in the said genocidal government.At 10:30 p.m. on the evening of 8th April 1994, Dr. Thédore Sindikubwabo, who was then the president of the National Assembly, in a radio broadcast to the nation, declared himself president of Rwanda, citing article 42 of the constitution of 10th June 1991. He announced a list of members of the "provisional government".Now, regardless of their political affiliation, 20 ministers on the morning of 9th April l994, pursuant to paragraph 56 of the constitution of 10th June 1991, pledged to do as follows, Your Honour, and I quote from paragraph 56 of that constitution. They pledged to: "Loyally carry out their duties and be faithful to the Republic of Rwanda, the Head of State, and most importantly, to promote the interest of Rwandan people".Your Honours, for those men and women who chose to serve in that said provisional government, and those who took the oath of office on the 9th of April, there was now a common denominator that held them together. It was not political affiliation, but rather, the need to fight the common enemy and those perceived as its accomplices.Your Honours, the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, an accountant by profession, chose to serve in that transitional government as Minister of Finance. He remained in that position, Your Honours, until November 1994. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, I would represent to Your Honours, was dedicated to cause and country, and that, we say, was a clear motive for participating in such a horrendous crime and criminal enterprise.Your Honours, it is not therefore surprising that having taken the said oath as indicated by paragraph 56 of the constitution, to be loyal to both cause and country, we find that the Accused Emmanuel Ndindabahizi participated in one form or the other in the killing of Tutsi in and around his native commune and prefecture of origin, Kibuye.Your Honours, the Accused was a member of the Social Democratic Party, the PSD. Indeed, he was the chairperson of the said party in his native Kibuye prefecture. In that regard, Your Honours -- sorry, in that regard, the Accused will have Your Honours believe that the PSD was indeed famous for its moderate stand prior to April 1994.The Prosecutor will, however, represent to Your Honours that whilst this may have been the case prior to 6th April 1994, the entire moderate leadership of the said party, including those PSD members who by virtue of the power-sharing agreement had participated in the Habyarimana government, had all been eliminated by 12th April l994. They included Félicien Gatabazi, the PSD leader and cabinet minister in the Habyarimana government, who was assassinated in April 1994. Mr. Frederic Nzamurambaho, who was the president of the PSD and also a minister in the Habyarimana government, was also assassinated on the 7th of April 1994.Now, Your Honours, those who had not fled the country, those who hadn't been killed in the first days of the genocide had, in fact, left the country, leaving only members of the PSD, like the Accused, who sympathised and identified with the extremist Hutu ideology to take part in the provisional government.Now, one of those who fled the country was a man called Marc Rugenera. He was a senior member of the PSD party and a finance minister in the Habyarimana government. Rugenera had been earmarked for elimination as well, but had only escaped death due to the fact that he did not reside in the ministerial district like other ministers. You would be interested to know, Your Honours, that the Accused that stands before you today replaced him in the genocidal government as Minister of Finance.To survive in government, the Prosecutor would represent to Your Honour that those who chose to remain in the said provisional government quite simply had to remain loyal and committed to the chosen path and had to be seen to be so. Indeed, those who remained there were at great pains to distance themselves from any association with the perceived enemy.On 19th April 1994, Your Honours, the interim President Sindikubwabo identified his government as "a government of saviours," a government that would come directly to the people "to tell you what it expects of you".During the third week of April 1994, ministers and other high-ranking officials did go into the countryside, insisting on the need to support the genocide, promising rewards to supporters and threatening sanctions against dissenters. Your Honours, the Accused was no exception.Prosecution Witness GKH was an elected parliamentarian. His only offence, Your Honour, was that he was married to a Tutsi woman. That witness will testify in the course of today how the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, accused him of being inactive and demanded the witness to waive his right to assume his elected seat in parliament in favour of another party member who was supposedly more active.In a speech during a visit to Butare on the 29th April l994, the then interim president, Théodore Sindikubwabo, emphasized that government ministers from Butare had returned home in order to supervise the killing of Tutsi. On the 18th of May 1994, Mr. Sindikubwabo visited Kibuye préfecture and publicly congratulated the Hutu population for having done its work.Similarly, the then interim Prime Minister, Jean Kambanda, visited Kibuye on 3rd May 1994. Various ministers of the interim government who originated from Kibuye prefecture were present at this meeting. This included the Accused, Your Honour. Witness GKH and Ms. Alison Des Forges will testify that despite the large-scale massacre that occurred in Kibuye prefecture between 14th and 30th April l994, absolutely none of the senior government ministers present at the said meeting, including the Accused, condemned or even referred to the massacres.In that regard we would submit to Your Honours that by focusing hatred on Tutsi, the organisers of killings hoped to forge solidarity amongst Hutus. But beyond that, Your Honours, they aimed at creating collective responsibility for genocide. People were encouraged to kill together so that no one would bear individual or total responsibility for the executions.The Prosecutor will represent to the Trial Chamber, that the involvement of the present population in the massacres that followed was facilitated by their misplaced belief, Your Honours, and confidence in their leadership, and also by an understanding that the encouragement of the authorities guaranteed them immunity to kill Tutsi and loot their property. From 12th April to the beginning of May 1994, the killers carried out the most devastating massacres of genocide throughout Rwanda.According to the 1991 census, 12.4 per cent of the Kibuye prefecture population was killed in the genocide. That means, Your Honour, approximately 80 per cent of the Tutsi population. The majority of those killed in Kibuye were killed in the first two weeks of the genocide, that is, between the 6th and 21st April, 1994, and then again in mid-May 1994. It is the Prosecution's case, Your Honours, that the Accused, as a member of the interim government, frequently visited Kibuye in order to instigate and order the killing of Tutsi civilians in his préfecture of origin.By virtue of his prominence in the local community, the Accused as president of the PSD party in Kibuye, as a serving minister, was clearly a person of considerable influence. As such, civilians, gendarmes, members of the Interahamwe militia, were more likely than not to follow his orders.Now, several Prosecution witnesses that you will hear in the course of this trial, Your Honours, will testify that roadblocks which had been established to promote security and check rising crime in Rwanda were very quickly transformed and used to identify Tutsi for killing.Now, by restricting movement at these roadblocks, it made it less likely for people to escape. In some cases, local businessmen and local officials, people like the Accused, sponsored these roadblocks and supported those who manned those roadblocks with food, drinks and weaponry. Your Honours, the Prosecutor will represent to you that as a member of the provisional government, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's mere presence at the roadblock, or indeed several roadblocks in and around Gitesi commune, or indeed his presence, or alleged presence during attacks in Gitwa Hill Karongi Hill, and in the area of Bisesero, would most certainly have an encouraging effect on the attackers. But more importantly, Your Honours, it would have conveyed to those attackers the impression that the killings of Tutsi in Kibuye was endorsed by the interim government.The Prosecutor would further represent to Your Honours that the actions of the Accused throughout the months of April, May, June 1994, as outlined in the indictment, namely, the distribution of weapons, his participation in the systematic killing by leading convoys, transporting attackers to massacre sites, being seen at several roadblocks at various locations, is demonstration of his specific intent to destroy in whole or in part of Tutsi as a group. Indeed, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's statements and directives provide direct evidence of his genocidal intent.In terms of context within which the activities were conducted, the Prosecutor will represent to Your Honours that there are striking similarities between the killing of Tutsi civilians at various roadblocks in Gitesi commune, Kibuye, the attacks on Gitwa Hill, also in Gitesi commune, the attacks in the area of Bisesero, and those launched against Tutsis in other areas and other parts of Kibuye préfecture and, indeed, in the country of Rwanda as a whole during the same period.Now, in that regard, Your Honour, it is the Prosecution's case that the mass killings and other crimes alleged in this present indictment or code, was part of a wider genocidal plan and policy to exterminate Tutsis throughout Rwanda between April and June 1994. To that end, I urge Your Honours not to assess the factual allegations that you would hear in this case in isolation, but, rather, to consider those allegations in the overall context of events -- the events that occurred in Rwanda between April and June 1994, and more specifically in Kibuye préfecture within the same period. Because it is only such an approach, Your Honours, that will provide you with a better understanding of the context within which the Accused committed the crimes alleged in the present indictment.Finally, Your Honour, as outlined in Appendix A of the pre-trial brief, the Prosecutor will rely on the evidence of 17 protected factual witnesses, an expert witness, and an investigator, during the course of this trial.Your Honours, based on the premise that the Prosecutor will be able to present four witnesses every week, I expect that the Prosecution will complete the presentation of her case within four weeks from today. Unless I can be of further assistance to Your Honours, the Prosecutor is ready to call her first witness. He is Mr. Upendra Baghel, an investigator from her office, and he will be led by my colleague, Mr. Wallace Kapaya.Your Honours, I thank you for your attention.</p>

            <p>First part contains the maps-it is having three maps; map of Rwanda, map of Kibuye and the road map. The map of Rwanda, which is the first map, I collected from the evidence unit. And the second map, which is map of Kibuye, was collected from the UNDP office Kigali, and it is in the database of Kigali investigations. The third road map is Kigali to Gitarama, and Gisenyi, Kibuye and Gitarama, which I prepared after visiting these places and travelling on the road, then plotting to the road which I took.</p>

            <p>Mr. Baghel, just very briefly, what's the relevance of these maps to the work you did in this case?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>The first map, which is the Rwanda map, it shows that Rwanda is surrounded by Tanzania, Burundi, Congo and Rwanda <stage>(sic),</stage> and it consists of eleven préfectures which have been shown in the map. The second map, which is of Kibuye because Kibuye is one of the préfectures of Rwanda, there is a map of Kibuye préfecture which shows that this préfecture is surrounded by Gisenyi, Gitarama, Gikongoro, Cyangugu préfectures. And this Kibuye préfecture consists of nine communes, and Gitesi is one of the communes. Third map, which is basically a road map, which shows that Kigali to Gitarama is around 42 kilometres, and Gitarama to Gisenyi is around 138 kilometres, Gisenyi to Kibuye is 104 kilometres, and Kibuye to Gitarama is 76 kilometres. I travelled on these roads and I measured the time which I took, which have been indicated in the map.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>All right. Now part 2 of the - of your work consists of, of sketches consisting of hills. Can you briefly describe the source of the information which is contained in this one, in this map?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>For the part 2, it shows the map of Gitwa hill and adjourning hills. Here, the primary source has been an earlier-prepared Bisesero map, the source of most of the hills, and which is in the evidence unit, and I was one of the members who prepared the map. This primary source after that I took to the field, and again, I contacted the concerned authorities and verified. So now, this map consists of the Gitwa hill and Gitesi commune and adjourning hills.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>And what is the relevance of these sketches in this case?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>During the course of the investigation of this file, I noticed that many witnesses are from Gitwa hill, which is in Gitesi commune, and some other hills nearby. So this map shows where Gitwa hill is located, which is hill number 25 on the Gitwa hill map, which is reference L0019869. And this hill is located on the road which goes from Kibuye to Karongi hill, which is hill number 20 is Karongi hill, and it goes Gisovu. And the adjourning hills are -- they are in Bisesero, which I numbered from one to 19. And there is one more road which comes from Kibuye to these hills directly, because these hills have been referred by the witnesses during the investigation, so these hills are depicted where they are located on the map.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Mr. Baghel, it relates to the names of the hills. We see in hill numbers 5, 6 -- in hill 5, they are all referred to as Gitwa hills. How would one make the distinction between the three hills?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>Yeah, hill number five and six, they are also called Gitwa hill, but they are in Gishyita commune; and hill number 24 - sorry, 25 is the Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune. These three hills are quite far away from 25, to hill number 5 and 6, and the direct distance between these hills can be measured because this map is as for the scale. It has been taken extract from map which was prepared in 199 -- in 1998 by the National Geography of Belgium in collaboration with Rwanda. So, these two hills are totally different.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, can you relate these hills to the photographs that you have prepared in this bundle?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>In this bundle, I took the photographs of Gitwa hill, which is in Gishyita commune, and this is hill number 25. And these photographs are in part 4, photo number 3 to 6. Photo number 3, which is on the page L0019886, is the photo of Gitwa hill taken from the roadside, and part of the road is seen. And photo number 4 is taken from the top of Gitwa hill, and as seen from the photograph, top of Gitwa hill having a small grass, small plants and loose stones.Photo 5 is taken from Gitwa hill towards left direction, that is, pointing towards hill number 26. So the front which we see the hill is hill number 26, called Gasagaza <stage>(phonetic)</stage> hill, and as this stretch of road is seen, this stretch of road goes to Kiziba. Now in Kiziba there is a refugee camp maintained by the UNHCR. Photo number 6 is also taken from the top of the hill on the right side, so on the right side this road is seen. This road is coming from Kibuye town and going through Gitwa hill to Karongi hill, then to Gisovu. And on the right side there is Kibuye town and the lay council, and the valley is seen. So these four photographs are concerned to hill 25, which is Gitwa hill in Gishyita commune.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Witness, when you took these photographs, did you take them in order to give the Court an impression of the topography, the landscape, the hills, or was it your purpose to identify particular locations in these hills which may be of relevance in this particular case?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>

            <p>The other photographs on the bundle, like photo 1, photo 2, they are about the Gitaka centres, and this Gitaka centre had been referred by few witnesses during the investigations. That's why I took the photograph of the centre. </p>

I reviewed some previous trial transcript and selected a few photographs which show the terrain, topography, and landscape and the kind of hills in the area. After that, I took them from evidence, evidence unit. They copied and gave me. Those photograph, I matched them with the copy in evidence unit, and after that I put them in this bundle.</p>

            <p>The sketches which are in part 3, these are sketches I prepared during the investigation of this file, and I filed them in evidence unit. While preparing these sketches, I accompanied with the witness, who showed me the place where a roadblock was there in 1994. And after getting some more information from witness about the location, the jurisdictional location like in which secteur, which commune, I prepared this sketch. Now, again, I took them from the evidence unit and re-verified, and after that I put them in this binder. </p>

And moreover, during the investigation also, I found the many witnesses were referring the names of Gitesi commune, different cellule and secteur.

            <p>Can we now look at L0019870, please, the little D of 2, small <stage>(ii).</stage> At the end of that paragraph, the last sentence reads that, "It can be granted that the Bisesero area covers parts of Gitesi, Gishyita and Gisovu," and we are referring here to communes, Gishyita commune, Giseti commune and Gisovu commune. Have you found where I am?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-baghel">

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Do you confirm that Bisesero area covers these three communes?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>Because I have been to this area on many occasions, so there is no fixed boundaries for the Bisesero area. The area which -- around these hills is known as Bisesero. So that's why areas of these three communes, not whole communes, some parts of the commune where these hills are there, is called the Bisesero area.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>What was your methodology in arriving at that conclusion? Was it by listening to the witnesses or did you consult maps?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>This is by listening to various informants, basically witnesses and some local, general informers. Like when we start from Kibuye town, if you say, "Which is Bisesero area?" Then they will point out to the hill, "This side is Bisesero." So this is not on the basis on maps, this is the basis - on the basis of local information gathered in the area.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Are you very sure, according to your research, that the Bisesero area is part of Gitesi commune, even if it's only a small part thereof?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, because Gitesi commune is quite large. Like hill 25, 26, if you go through the hill map, it is in the Gitesi commune. And if you go to the north of hill 25, 26, they will refer these hills towards Bisesero. So this - there is no clear-cut distinction. Bisesero, which I mentioned here, Bisesero is the name of a cellule, is name of a secteur, name of a hill also. So Bisesero area is having very big boundaries.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Your Honours. I would like us to deal with number three, which is at the very bottom of that page. This question is as follows: "In Bisesero stand the communes of Gishyita and Gisovu in Kibuye préfecture, Rwanda." That's right, Mr. President. The Defence did admit that proposal by the Prosecutor, as you can, yourself, see; but today the investigator from the Prosecution is telling us that the Bisesero area spreads through Gishyita, Gisovu and Giseti communes. We believe that we have already resolved this matter in the framework of the Prosecutor's motion, and we should not come today to be told that the Bisesero area also covers Giseti commune.</p>

It's in higher elevation than Gitaka centre. And if you take up some place, like locate some few metre here and there, you can see Gitaka centre from the place, from the house. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>This hill is quite high and it can be seen in the photograph also. There is a valley on the one side, like if you see photograph No. 46.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, but when I look at that photograph 3, it does not seem that it's a very high hill, actually, it seems like a slight rise in this lay of the land. Could you please explain this to us?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-baghel">
            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>Because when you travel on the road, the road is passing through the hills, going from one hill to other hill. So on the side of these roads you see photograph No. 3, on the left side there is a valley, so height has to be relative phenomenon. So this hill is quite high compared to other -- other very near hills, but Karongi is the highest hill in this area. So this hill is quite high. It seems as -- quite flat because photograph No. 4 is taken from the top, but we have to see the locations of -- like photograph Nos. 5 and 6, you'll see that, yes, valleys are there and hill is quite high compared to other hills.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS BAGHEL:</speaker>
            <p>No, because for this -- like for the purpose of this case I did not take the photograph of those hills because through the photograph Nos. 7 to 16, the hills have been projected, how the hills look like in this area. And all the hills are like -- they look almost similar but there are a lot of hills and there is a road in-between and hills are covered with vegetation, trees, like a little bit of forest in the valleys. So which is -- these have been presented in photo 7 to photo 16.</p>

And, in fact, I visited like sketch number -- sketch number -- sketch on L001-9881. This sketch has been prepared when I went with the witness and that time he referred to the Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune which is hill 25 here.

That's why to project what kind of terrain of the hills in that area, topography, what kind of vegetation is there where those witnesses fled. That's why I took those photographs.

            <p>Mr. President, while we are waiting for the next witness I would like to draw to your attention that during the status conference that was held last week we had agreed with the Prosecutor as to the order in which the witnesses would appear. However, we were informed just a few hours ago that this order was going to be modified and that the witness that was scheduled to testify today was not the one that had been specified during the status conference. We do not wish to cause an incident with respect to this, but we just wish to draw your attention to the fact that this state of affairs raises some difficulties for the Defence. At the present time, at this very moment, we do not know what this witness will say in his testimony, but in view of his statement, it is possible that as a result of the testimony of this witness we might ask for some additional time before we begin ourcross-examination. We might, for example, request that we begin our cross-examination tomorrow morning if this is required.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you. You are quite right. It follows from the notification we were provided with today that the order of witnesses has been changed. This being said, I note that there is no request for additional time as of now, and we will see how this develops. Could we then bring in the next witness, Prosecution? </p>

            <p>Your Honour, the Prosecution proposes to call Witness GKH -- gulf, kilo, hotel. That witness is listed as No. 3 on your list. Your Honour, I acknowledge my learned friend's comment in relation to the order that we had indicated. There are certain circumstances that govern these trials that are absolutely beyond my control as Your Honour may be aware of. This particular witness that I had requested to travel was unable to travel, and other issues came up over the weekend that necessitated us taking this particular witness instead of the prior indicated witness. But I assure both Your Honours and my learned friend for the Defence that we do this in good faith.</p>

            <p>No, no, Your Honour, witness 1 is actually here. CGH is here. But we -- based on reconfirmation exercise over the weekend, we felt a lot more comfortable with GKH to come now and CGH to come right after him. So we kind of reversed the order but -- So, if I can be of some assistance whilst we wait for the witness to come in. I have informed my learned friend for the Defence that we would take Gulf-Hotel - sorry, Gulf-Kilo-Hotel now. We hope to finish with him today. We will then take Charlie-Gulf-Hotel second, hopefully, tomorrow at this time; we will then take Charlie-Gulf-Kilo, third. And that would be it for this week, at least as far as I know. As I stand before you I have no other witnesses in Arusha.</p>

Your Honour, may I start by asking the Registry to kindly hand to the witness a personal information form, as is customary in this Trial Chamber, to dispense with the need to have to go through his personal identification details with him. It's signed. He just signed it in the witness room and I just want him to confirm it for the record that he does agree with its contents. I'll then enter it into evidence. Mr. Registry, can you assist me, please? Very kind. Whilst that is being done, Your Honour, due to the nature of this witness's testimony, I am afraid that I am going to have to make one of those applications that doesn't endear me terribly with the press and the public. And in that regard, I am making an application under Rule 79 <stage>(A)</stage>
              <stage>(ii).</stage> And the application unfortunately is that the press and the public be excluded from part -- and I emphasise, part -- of these proceedings for reasons of the safety, security and the non-disclosure of the identity of this witness, pursuant to Rule 75 <stage>(B)</stage>
              <stage>(ii).</stage> In terms of the scope of the order, and I hasten to add that the first three segments of this witness's testimony has to be in closed session and I would only request to re-open the session towards the end of his testimony when we talk about more general events in the locations that he is going to be testifying about. Your Honour would see, having closely scrutinised his particulars and, indeed, his -- the nature of his testimony as indicated in page 4 of the English version of his statement -</p>

Yes, he only has one statement dated the 10th of May 2001.Your Honours, I draw Your Honours' attention to page 4 at least of the English version. And if you look at the paragraph that starts "In early think June 1994", Your Honours would see from the discussion there that it is very unlikely that there were many people in this witness's position at that particular time. It is certainly an issue that troubles my witness very much, and it is an issue that he has raised and I cannot but agree with his representations that if I adduce that sort of evidence in public then he certainly would be identified.</p>

Approximately how much do you intend to be in closed until you open or are there anything you could take in open first before you move into these other areas?</p>

            <p>Your Honour, it's difficult and it's perhaps also totally inconsequential to my case whether or not I deal with those general matters.

At any rate, the Registry will announce whether we can go into open session later on. That is the situation. If the public will then kindly leave the gallery and we will proceed. Mr. Witness, you have listened to this discussion and I am sure you have seen that in order to protect your safety we will now close these proceedings. That implies that everything that's going to happen here now will only be heard by the parties and the staff. There is no one in the public gallery, and the transcripts of the proceedings will be kept under seal afterwards. So now you can speak freely. </p>

            <p>Well, apparently they were all there, but mainly those from Kibuye, because the prime minister had come to visit Kibuye prefecture, and so those who were natives of Kibuye had to be there. </p>

            <p>Well, they had to be there, because the prime minister, who was the one who had appointed them, had come to their prefecture, therefore there was no reason for them not to be there and to be where he was, especially as the visit dealt with Kibuye prefecture. So they had to attend the meeting.</p>

            <p>Well, the main purpose -- at least this is what the prime minister said -- it dealt with pacification with respect to the killings, the massacres. And so the main word was pacification. And he spoke about the RPF, that RPF units had attacked the country, that we needed to fight, that we would defeat them, but he was saying that we had to stop the killings. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-gkh">
            <speaker>WITNESS GKH:</speaker>
            <p>Well, not on that specific date, but between April and May there had been massacres in Kibuye at the Home St. Jean, at the parish, at Gatwaro stadium, at Nyange and Mugonero, and they had already started in Bisesero. But fighting still continued, so everywhere there were massacres and killings.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-gkh">
            <speaker>WITNESS GKH:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, a person named Leonard Hitimana. He was a doctor. He was a member of the MDR party, but from the moderate MDR wing. He condemned the massacres. He said that small children remained in the stadium and at the Home St. Jean and had been taken to hospital, and that it was necessary to watch over them, to bring them food, to take care of them, because they were still there. And the person named Eliezer Niyitegeka said that was none of his business and was not his problem, even though he was a physician, these matters were none of his business. And this is why, after the meeting, Dr. Hitimana had to flee, because he was being persecuted. He had to flee the country. He went to Congo and did not come back until some time much later. And so there were persons who had bad intentions and did not want people to be saved.</p>

            <p>There was a person -- I can't recall this person's name -- a person from Gisheta commune. I can't remember the name just now, but it will come back to me. Yes, it was Sikuwabo, and he said that there were RPF soldiers in Bisesero and he was asking for assistance, asking that soldiers be sent to fight them. And the prime minister said, "You must be watchful and see whether they were RPF soldiers, Inkotanyi, or if they were Batutsi who had fled to that location. If they were Batutsi, you should leave them, but if they were RPF soldiers, tell us, and we will provide assistance so that you can fight them". </p>

I don't really recall. Turquoise was also in Kibuye, because I think it was towards the end of May when Turquoise went to Bisesero to try and save the survivors who had remained there after the massacres. </p>

            <p>Thank you. It was during the month of August, I believe it was on the 10th or the 11th, I received a telephone call from someone who was claiming to know me and they wanted to meet me in a bar. I was busy, and I told this person that I could go there later. This person called me back, and so I went to see this person. I didn't know this person, but there is someone who knew me and knew the person. And when I reached the bar I had a drink, and I was expecting for someone to come and see me and say, "I have been looking for you." After approximately ten minutes this person said, "Well, where is so and so?" The person who knew me said, "Well, he's there." So this person came and greeted me. It was around 5 p.m. or 7 p.m., but we could see with the lamp. So we moved to one side of the road, and he told me that he was contacting me at the request of Ndindabahizi's counsel and that he wanted me to make a statement for Ndindabahizi's defence, and he told me that he had been sent by counsel. He gave me his name. His first name was Jean Pierre; I don't remember his surname. I know someone who had lived with this person. And he told me, "To confirm this, I can say that during the month of August you will be travelling to Arusha to testify." He showed me a document on which was written the names of all the persons who were going to come and testify here in Ndindabahizi's trial and their pseudonym. I believe that is the word that you used, was that. He said, "This is your name and this is your pseudonym." And he read the names. I recognised some of the names; these were some of the people I knew. And I told him, "I cannot speak double-talk. If you know that I am going to Arusha, then I go to Arusha. I will not change my testimony and I cannot give you a statement." And I know that subsequently he went to see other people who will perhaps come, and they contacted me and said, "Were you contacted by someone?" And they said, "Yes, I was contacted." And they said, "We met with this person as well." I thought this person was an employee of the ICTR, and when I mentioned this to someone they said, "No, it wasn't us because you know us." And when I reached Kigali before I came here, I spoke to ICTR employees in Kigali because if we are to be protected, then everything should be done in the strictest confidence. I mean, I've left my house, and now everyone knew I was coming to Arusha. And this is why I said this, in case there were any problems, so people would know how things actually took place. This is what I have to say. </p>

            <p>Let the records reflect, Your Honour, that the 10th of August is three days after I made unredacted disclosure of my entire witness list to the Defence team in Paris, France. I have no further questions for this witness.Thank you, Mr. Witness. </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Before I lead the cross-examination with this witness, there was one point that I would like to clarify, and I would like to ask the Prosecutor to which part of the indictment he is referring to. When hearing this witness, what are the relevant parts of the indictment that pertain to this witness, because I have closely read the indictment and I do not see that Mr. Ndindabahizi is accused of having participated in a meeting on the 3rd of May, 1994, in Kibuye, and I do not see that he is accused of having had a meeting with the witness in June 1994. So from a legal perspective, I believe it is important to clarify which specific parts of the indictment are relevant to this testimony and to the testimony made by this witness. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>That's a very simple matter, Your Honour. They are factual allegations in any indictment and there's also something called specific intent to commit genocide. Genocide and intent, that's what it goes to, Your Honour. It doesn't have to be clearly stated in the indictment. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I believe that we will have to go a bit further, but maybe we will do this in our closing argument. Mr. President, there's two points I would like to make. First of all, this witness was supposed to testify at a later time, and I have understood that we would only have three witnesses this week. Therefore, if we request that we -- that today's session be shortened, I believe that we will not lose -- that we will not get behind. And would it be possible for the Trial Chamber to order that cross-examination begin tomorrow afternoon, especially as it is now currently six -- ten minutes past six. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>The Chamber is, of course, like both parties, willing -- no, eager to move things forward and use court time in an efficient way, but this being said, we note, as mentioned by the Defence, that there has been a change in the witness sequencing. We also note the explanation of the Prosecution previously why that happened during the weekend. In view of the fact that there is a limited number of witnesses, at least for the time being, in the couple of days to come, we would see no problems in granting the Defence request and start tomorrow at two o'clock. Yes.Could we plan now a little bit forward, Prosecution? You have mentioned the witnesses. We have the investigators, we have the present one -- and I don't think there is any harm in the witness listening to this.Mr. Witness, we are now just discussing a few procedural issues. If you could kindly bear with us a couple of minutes. And as you understood, we will come back to you tomorrow at two o'clock, but before we close for the day, only a few practical arrangements.Now, the next -- please, Mr. Phillips, first let me ask the Defence the estimated time for the cross-examination of this witness, it being understood that it is certainly only an estimate. </p>

            <p>I am Ndindabahizi's counsel. I am going to ask you a few questions, not too many, on your testimony. I would like you to ask -- answer your questions as briefly and as precisely as possible. Let's begin with the multiparty era in Rwanda. That was the beginning of your testimony yesterday. You stated that from a given point in time, political parties were authorised and they were able to operate on the territory Rwanda; is that correct, and what time exactly was that?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-gkh">
            <speaker>WITNESS GKH:</speaker>
            <p>Do you remember the Boule conference in France which enabled multipartyism to start? So I believe in Rwanda from 1991, that is when it started. I am not sure exactly, but I think it was in 1991 that multipartyism started.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS GKH:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you. Apart from the MRND which was already in place, there was the MDR, the PSD. There was the PL, PDC, PDI. There was also the DPR. In fact, there were several parties. There were many parties. PSD also was included.</p>

            <p>It depends a little bit on the -- on the question to be posed. Can we hear the question first? And we agree -- I mean, both parties are now actively searching not to divulge the identity of the witness, so that is something we are very eager to avoid, Mr. Witness. We are looking -- we are very careful now. Now, let me first hear the question. And Mr. Witness, you do not have to answer this question. We just want to hear the question, and we will then assess whether we can continue with that question or whether we go into closed. And at some stage, we will obviously have to go into closed. The only issue now is the timing. Yes, please, the question, please.</p>

            <p>You also said that the PSD was a party whose aim was to promote social progress. Can you please explain to us what you intend to mean by the term social welfare, social promotion?</p>

            <p>I rather said that the PSD was a moderate party whose objective was social welfare, that's what I said. I didn't say social progress, I said social well being. Now, in that context, with that term I mean that the PSD -- first of all, the MRND as it was, and had limited itself to some parts of the country where there were tendencies in various parts, depending on who the party official was or who the president was. The PSD in its party said that any Rwandan citizen, any Rwandan national, should enjoy social development and should be able to enjoy democratic rights. So the PSD had as an objective the fact that any Rwandan enjoy his or her social welfare without any restriction from any side whatsoever, because the MRND was biased. That's what I can say.</p>

            <p>Yes.

            <p>There is a point of order here. When both counsel and the witness are talking the same language, it is very tempting to enter into a dialogue immediately, in other words, not allowing for translation; but both interlocutors must remember to pause for about four seconds so that we will get the rest of the sentence before you start.

For example, on the 6th of April the president died. A few days later the government was formed, and the killings did not cease. The MRND had soldiers, militia from the MRND, and they should have wielded their power over the people. If the people had already started to kill their brothers, the soldiers that were everywhere in the country -- I mean, one word from the head of government or from the prime minister could have stopped the situation, and if they did not do so, then it is the government's fault.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS GKH:</speaker>
            <p>That's what I was saying, that's what I meant. The government had already been established, and there was a minister of defence whose job was to supervise the soldiers if they went above the government. If I had been in the government, I would have stepped down and I would have left the soldiers to work alone. If I was not allowed to have any power on them, I would have resigned.</p>

            <p>Yes, but that's not the question, Witness. I am not asking what you would have done, but I am asking about the events that have already taken place. I am asking you, would it be possible that the soldiers -- that the officers took decisions without referring to the government or to the minister of defence, whether that would be a classic case of rebellion?</p>

You said that men and women involved in politics, especially those who were members of opposition parties, and specifically those who were members of the PSD, could be divided in a schematic form in three groups. There is the category of those who were killed during the first few days and the days that followed; secondly, there are those who fled, those who went into hiding; and finally, there are those who participated in the government.

            <p>The persons who fled, those who are part of the second category, in your opinion did they do this as a political gesture to show - were they taking a political stand to show that they were against what was happening in Rwanda, or did they proceed in this manner because they were trying to save their lives?</p>

            <p>They were trying to seek refuge. They could either go to the RPF or they could flee to another country, to Zaire, to the Congo; or they could join the Rwandan army, because those that went over to the Rwandan army did not die. If they joined the RPF, it is because they were sure that they would not be killed there. They would not be killed by soldiers or the Interahamwe, because it was alleged that there was a list saying who was -- specifying who was supposed to be killed. There was a list and people knew. You would go Ngango's house because there was a list, and then in the meantime you would be going to the houses of the other persons whose names appeared on the list. It wasn't just by chance that these killings took place, especially as far as important politicians are concerned. I specified -- I gave you the example of the PSD, and I mentioned the names of Hutus. I did not mention the names of the Tutsi because they were classified by ethnic group. I am speaking here of these persons' beliefs or their ideology, the fact that they were against the MRND. And if you had a Hutu person who was a member of the PSD and who is against the MRND, in another words, I mean, why would they die? Why would they be killed?</p>

And in view of the decision we took about that particular meeting yesterday, I think this is the time to close the session. It's logical. It's just the same regime we operated under last time we discussed this issue. So we have tried to keep this session open as far as possible, because we always prefer to keep transparency and openness, but when it comes to protecting the identity of the witness, we have also to be careful, and now we have reached a point where I am afraid we have to make the ruling that the public is kindly asked to leave the public gallery, and we will continue then in a closed session. Could we indicate approximately, Defence counsel, how much time you envisage for the rest of your cross-examination so that the public would know when to come back again, approximately?MR.

            <p>Having listened to the way this witness responds to the questions, it seems to me that it's a risky course of action to remain in open session. So, unfortunately to the public, I think we have to close because of the protection of the witness, because we wanted to stay in open, but it's developing in a way which could be harmful. So let's now move again into closed session. </p>

There are two problems in this case, and we would like to know the conditions under which you know or did not know the first time you met in 1990, 1991, 1992, Mr. Ndindabahizi to your knowledge. If I compare your testimony of today and the one you made to the investigators, are you able to clarify where Mr. Ndindabahizi lived when you were born and grew up?</p>

            <p>Very well. In your statement to the investigators, you said that Ndindabahizi lived in Kigali from January until '94, and do you know approximately what date where Ndindabahizi lived without you knowing him, and can you be more specific today?</p>

That's some days after the killing of the president, but that Mugemagango, at the end of his speech, was stoned, but until then there had not been any looting nor any killings.

He did not kill me. I gave him a note of 5,000 shillings which I had with me. I went towards Nyabahanga River, and that's where I saw aircraft flying overhead. And I asked people why the planes were there, because I thought they were looking for Tutsis. I went back to the person who had provided me shelter. They opened the door. I told them, "I see there are planes circling in the sky. Why are they there?"

He didn't want you to repeat all your evidence. But leaving that aside, now the question is this episode about giving a person a note and seeing the planes. When was that? Was it before or after the alleged episode with Mr. Ndindabahizi?</p>

            <p>Well, we will come to Nyabahanga a little bit later. Maybe it's a good idea to have known what was happening in the various areas, but we have to follow it all chronologically. I think we are speaking about the incident which you have referred to on the banks of Nyabahanga River. I am speaking about the time where, for about a month, you were hiding in bushes close to the roadblock at Fayer.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-ctk">
            <speaker>WITNESS CTK:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>So we will have problems of chronology, chronology, which don't only contradict one another, but they are also inconsistent. You say you spent three weeks at your godmother's house. Unfortunately, I have to look at this chronology myself. After the -- on the 13th of April, you went to your godmother and you spent three weeks there. That takes us to the 4th of May. And you say, "I spent three weeks in my godmother's house." That takes you to the end of April. And then three weeks you went to the place which was close to the Fayer roadblock. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>And I am saying, Mr. President, that there is inconsistency, and I want to determine where it arises from.MR. KAPAYA:Your Honour -MR. MARÇAIS:The witness has just said that she had spent two weeks there and not one month.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>There is a need to simplify the proceedings now. Defence counsel, you are using too many words and you are mixing the questions with argumentation, and that is not simplifying your communication with this witness. So it's important, for ease of communication, just to concentrate on the brief questions and receive, hopefully, the brief answers. And then you will later address the Bench on alleged inconsistencies. So if you would assist us in this way, then, as I say, it will become more efficient.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>I shall repeat my question. I had thought I heard the witness said that she only remained for two weeks there. I am reading and I can hear, "I spent three weeks at my godmother's house and then two weeks in the bushes near the Fayer roadblock." This seems to take us to the middle of May, but the witness has just mentioned the end of May, and I want to have for clarification because this seems to me to be inconsistency.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>May I make a comment, Your Honour? The witness is talking of a period of "about". She is not saying exactly three weeks, she is not saying exactly two weeks. She is saying about two weeks, about three weeks. I think counsel should take this into account when posing his question to the witness.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>But in fact we have now, we have now been circling around this issue, beginning of May, middle of May and end of May, for quite some time. I think we know the witness's answer. The answer is the end of May. She has been asked many times now. The question, then, is whether that is inconsistent with a calculation based on the calendar, and that is something you will come back to later. You have made your point. You have made your point that there is an inconsistency, in your view.</p>

            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>It's the last answer given by the witness in which she said, when I asked her how she survived for a whole month, she said, "No, not a month, a fortnight." And I said at that time that if we were to do the arithmetic and look at the statement, this brings us to the middle of May. That was a mere observation I was making.</p>

            <p>In a pick-up, a while ago you said that there were other persons, two, three persons in Ndindabahizi's private vehicle who came to the roadblock; is that correct? </p>

            <p>I thought I understood you to say, and correct me if I'm wrong, that there was a roadblock manned by Hutus, and that the two vehicles we are referring to come to the roadblock under the conditions that you recounted. Did the roadblock already exist with the Hutus manning it when the vehicles, that you referred to as Ndindabahizi's vehicle and the pick-up -- </p>

          <sp who="#witness-ctk">

            <speaker>WITNESS CTK:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I did not know them. I didn't live in that locality. They were wielding machetes and clubs, and that is clubs that we call ntampongano.</p>

            <p>It seems that there's a small confusion, Madam Witness. A moment ago I was speaking to you about where you were hiding in a mound or close to the roadblock near Fayer, and you say you were drinking water from the river. I think you may have confused this with the time when you had fled to the place close to Nyabahanga river. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-ctk">
            <speaker>WITNESS CTK:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I did make that mistake. At the time when I was in that place, I didn't have anything to drink or eat. Sometimes I could have had bananas given to me by people who, like me, were fleeing.</p>

            <p>I'm now coming to the last episode -- no, let me go back to the episode following the Ndindabahizi. At the roadblock you were saying Ndindabahizi was speaking to the Hutus, you are referring, undoubtedly, to the Hutus who were manning the roadblock, unless I am mistaken?</p>

            <p>Very well. Now, on the episode dealing with the Nyabahanga river, you said in your written statement that you met a Hutu carrying a spear who struck you and wounded you, and today you talked about a Hutu who threatened you, so which is the truth? Which is which? </p>

            <p>Thank you. I have a question I think, rather, to the Prosecution, but the witness should be waiting in case we may need her.Now, this Fayer roadblock, in our bundle of documents which you produced as Prosecution Exhibit 2 there is a document which seems to be relevant to this episode, and this sketch seemed to have a link with that particular witness.

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

            <p>It may well be as a direct result of the comments we've heard from witnesses this week, and that's a matter that I would address in due course. I have no way of verifying the circumstances that have led to this witness. As far as I'm aware, when we had a status conference, Your Honour was told that all was well.</p>

            <p>I'm interested in the provisions of that rule. And whilst I am mindful of the fact that Judges may at any stage -- Your Honours may at any stage put questions to witnesses whilst they're testifying in this courtroom, it has to be said on the record that such questions cannot be seen to compromise either the case of the Prosecution or, indeed, that of the Defence. Certainly that is not the idea behind Rule 85 <stage>(B).</stage> We're all officers of the court, and indeed, be us on the Bench or at the bar, my training suggests that we're all officers of the court. And as officers of the court, we have a duty to our clients, be you the Prosecution or the Defence, and in exercising that duty, we do it, at least my training tells me that we do it, with the utmost courtesy to the Bench and, perhaps, often expect that that courtesy be extended to us, be us the Prosecution or the Defence.Now, a situation arose this evening, Your Honour, which I find extremely regrettable, where my learned friend and colleague, a very senior member of the Tanzanian bar, was stopped and restrained and almost bullied from asking or objecting to a question which he felt was extremely pertinent and legitimate which -- the result of which may have ended up compromising the evidence of a Prosecution evidence.Now, the position is this: He makes an observation following a question from Your Honour, and he does it in good faith. He does it as a result of his duty, as an officer of this court, to protect that witness. He did so, being extremely courteous to the Bench. I would leave this courtroom this evening with the regrettable feeling that that courtesy may not have been extended to him as a result of the way Your Honour intervened and restrained him from asking that question, and I regret that. And I must say, as lead counsel representing the Prosecution, I regret that.I would also add that if I had a younger and more junior counsel assisting me today, the end result of which would have been such a lawyer may have been frightened out of his or her wits, unable to continue with the job that I have assigned him to do this evening, and that in itself would have compromised my case.I leave this courtroom this evening with a feeling that, unfortunately, somewhere along the line that courtesy, which I expect as Prosecution counsel, has not been extended to the Prosecution.I'm grateful for your attention.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you very much for drawing our attention to this issue, Mr. Phillips. I am now happy to make my contribution so that you will not leave the courtroom with that feeling; neither should Mr. Kapaya do so. What happened here was quite normally only the issue that there was, during a question by the Defence, an objection by the Prosecution. That is perfectly legitimate, and, as you just said, that is what any officer of the court is expected to do. What happened, however, was that that particular objection was formed in a way which could indicate the answer to that witness. Now, this happens on many occasions, and we all know that that is something that should be avoided.There was certainly no -- any intention to hurt anyone or to not express courtesy. And Mr. Kapaya and I, we have worked together in this courtroom for a long time and in many cases, and you know I have the utmost respect for Mr. Kapaya, and that respect is unchanged. And you will then note that after that particular episode where I had to stop him, because the objection was suggestive, that the cooperation in a very courteous manner continued, in my view, from both sides.So I do not think we should blow up this episode, and it's my absolute belief that we will continue, as we have done previously, to cooperate to the fullest extent. Thank you very much.Now, the Court is now adjourned to Monday at two o'clock.</p>

            <p>I knew him a long time ago, while he was still in school and I was a child. I was in primary school at the time. He was studying at the university, and we would meet sometimes during the holidays, as well as on other occasions. Subsequently, sometime after he finished his studies, I would see him at the Kibuye Trafipro -- I do not know whether he was working there or whether he was just passing by but I would see him in the building of the Trafipro, and I do not know whether he was carrying out any activities there. And then I would see him on the road. He was one of the great intellectuals of our region. We were saying that we were lucky to have someone in university because it was rare to have someone in university. So he was someone who was well known in our region and that's how I came to know him.</p>

            <p>I do not remember. It was at a time when one referred to as Trafipro in our country, in the 1980s or at least before 1980, when we had what we referred to as Trafipro in our country. I saw him but I do not remember the exact period of time. I didn't have any particular reason for me to remember the period of time during which I saw him. So, we had what were referred to as Trafipro cooperatives and it was during that period of time, when these Trafipro cooperatives existed, that I used to see him.</p>

On it were soldiers and people dressed in civilian clothing, and there was another white vehicle and the two vehicles stopped below a road -- below a woods on the road.

Because when the vehicles were coming up the hill, when the Interahamwe were coming up to the top of the hill, we would go down from the top of the hill to see what the vehicles and the Interahamwes were doing. We were in the bush on the hill, but I was with other people who unfortunately are dead now, and we were at the distance of about 25 to 30 metres from where these people were standing.

Well, obviously, we were afraid but, you know, we had women and children among us. We were obviously afraid but what did you want us to do? </p>

            <p>They came aboard the Daihatsu vehicle. At least, there were some members of the population who were at the back of this vehicle, this small vehicle, but on the road there were other members of the population, and when we saw these vehicles stop, all around there were members of the population who were getting ready to attack us. And normally, around eight o'clock, there are members of the population all along the road, so the vehicles arrived and found these other members of the population who were already there. There were very many. </p>

            <p>I have said this to you. Do you want me to repeat what I said? The attackers came and they killed people, and that's what I've told you. The Accused was not the only one. I have spoken of the situation from the month of April until the time when we went to hide in Gitwa hill. I do not know; maybe you know the situation better than I do. I do not want to repeat what I've already said. If you didn't understand what I said, maybe you can go to Kibuye and one could explain the situation better to you there. Maybe you can come with me. You certainly will be able to see, at least, one bone. My children, my six children were killed in that place.</p>

            <p>Yes, I witnessed killings. From the 10th until the 26th we were on Gitwa hill and we were targets of attacks by members of the population whom we tried to repel with stones until Ndindabahizi came with machetes which he distributed to the members of the population.</p>

            <p>Let me explain to you briefly. From the 10th we were not spending nights in our house; we were at Gitwa. People who came to hide at Gitwa were fleeing attacks from members of the population and their houses had also been burnt down. I was one of the people who were lucky to survive those attacks. What I'm telling you is true. If you wish, we can go together and the members of the population who are still alive in Gitwa will be able to tell you how things happened. Otherwise you, yourself, can make a stop there.</p>

            <p>I did not do any studies which would enable me to get altitude. You are asking me questions on matters I have not studied. Maybe it's 1,500 metres, but I'm not very well versed in those issues of determining how high hills are in terms of altitude. I know that it's a high hill, and we sought refuge there in order to try and escape the attacks that were launched against us; otherwise, I do not know how altitudes of hills or mountains are measured.</p>

            <p>Objection, Your Honour. My learned friend is misleading the witness. It's very apparent and obvious from L0019883 that those pictures were taken on the 16th of August 2003. If Your Honours recall, the investigator did say that he had no indication what the vegetation was in 1994. It's a deliberate misrepresentation, Your Honour.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, there are several photographs in this folder. We will go one by one. Look first now at photographs Nos. 3 and 4. The place where you were hiding, did it look like this one -- or these two, or was it different?</p>

            <p>At the time it was covered by bush but, subsequently, the bush was burnt down to chase us out. Here, I see that there is very little bush. Regarding the photographs, I don't know if they took the photograph -- I don't know much about photography or the hills. All I can say is that at that time there was a lot of bush. Probably -- on the next photograph I see that there is a bit of bush but, later on, all this bush was burnt down. But -- well, maybe in the photograph, the third photograph, I realise that that looks more like what it looked like then. There are just some shrubs here. I don't know if a photograph of that place was taken. I would have shown them where I was hiding, but they chose to photograph this area.</p>

Even at 200 metres, if you are in danger of death, you will be able to hear people who are planning against you. When somebody is in danger of death he is able to hear him from a great distance.

            <p>Yes, obviously, because in such situations, you want to hear what these people are saying so you can escape them or face them. When we saw them distributing the machetes and talking among themselves, we said to ourselves that they had no guns, and that reassured us to some extent because if they attack us without guns, they are not able to kill us.

            <p>This is my last but one question, Mr. President. And I'm asking Witness -- I'm telling Witness he really does not know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and I don't even think he knows him at all. And I am putting it to him that he was unable to identify him during the events that he is referring to.</p>

            <p>There are lawyers or assistants -- assistants to some lawyers from other countries. And these people come and put questions to these people. But these are confidential matters, particularly concerning our security. But some of these people come to us, go to the hills, to the communal office, and in front of the public have someone's written -- I was interviewed in 2001. And before I came here, I met investigators, and that was done in a confidential manner. But these people I am referring to, come publicly. They write summons at the communal office. And we are summoned to the communal office as if we are criminals to be interviewed. And when we are interviewed to request us to come and testify here, we are told that it is confidential. I'm not criticising these people, but I am requesting that this does not -- is not repeated, or I request the Chamber to go after these people. I have a document here which has the communal stamp. And these are people that we do not know who bring you this document, present the document to you. This document was given to me on the 15th of July; that is the date on the document. These people receive -- people receive these summons from strangers. And these are people who want to interview us; whereas, they should be interviewing us in a confidential manner, they give this document to the communal secretary or to a third party, even to children. But it is written on this document, you can see, written, the International Criminal Tribunal of Arusha <stage>(sic).</stage> I think this issue needs to be looked at closely. Our security should be safeguarded. Maybe you should contact the Kibuye authorities. I don't know if you are thinking about ensuring our security after we have been killed. There are very few people who are ready to come and testify here and I think we ought to be protected.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, the Tribunal is very anxious to protect the security of the witnesses. And we have a unit, a section which is particularly trained in these matters. And they usually proceed very discreetly in order to avoid exactly what you are indicating. Now, are you saying that Tribunal staff approached the communal authority in a transparent way so that it became transparent, then visible? Is that -- are you talking about Tribunal staff? Have you seen them, yourself? Who are these persons that you are referring to?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgn">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGN:</speaker>
            <p>I don't know these people, but these must be officers of the Tribunal, and they want to interview you publicly, before the public, in a room at the communal office, everybody sees you. There was a Rwandan woman with these people. And let me add, to appoint somebody who is in Kigali, and for these people to go and look for people he knows; you should not be appointing just anybody to go and contact people, people that he does not know. It is not proper to proceed in that manner.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, you said that -- you testified that some Hutus were attacking Tutsis at that particular period. My question was whether you knew the reason why those particular Hutus were attacking the Tutsis at that particular period.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I know the reason. Mention had already been made of that; and then there was a radio which was heating up people's head, especially the RTLM. And there were others who were acting because of their sense of morality or their religious convictions.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>On RTLM, it was being said that the Inkotanyi had wanted to grab the country, to kill Hutus; and, therefore, Hutus needed to do everything in their power to try to protect themselves and try to ensure their safety and security.</p>

And I tried to take these people to a friend's house. As for myself, I remained on Gitwa. And from time to time, I would go to the home of the person I have just referred to.

            <p>No. There were no préfets or minister on the Gitwa hill. But before the large-scale attack that I referred to, some government officials came to give instructions, but they were not very visible, because people were staying -- in hiding.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>It wasn't either a valley nor was it a desert, but there was a slight slope. There was a kind of a small hill or mound.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Witness, when you said that in order to give an indication of the distance, it was between you and even longer than the glass wall, which glass wall, which wall on which side of the courtroom, please? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>I gave the example of that distance from that side where that camera is suspended up to the other end where there are other glass, in other words, the opposite direction.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>All right. So one glass wall to the other glass wall, and according to the courtroom measurements, document we have in front of us here, it has been measured by the Court Management Section and from the glass of the translators' booth to the wall of the video booth, is about 21 metres. So that is on record. </p>

            <p>Let me go over my answer and attempt to explain to you. I did not stay with my wife and children because they were not at the same place; they were in two separate places. They used to come and fetch people from houses, and those who did not collaborate with the attackers, the killer were worried by the attackers. That is why part of my family was in the houses and others were in the camp. There was no other way of -- there was no place that was safe during those -- during that time. <stage>(Pages 45 to 51 by Haruna Farage)</stage> 1830H</p>

I went to Gitwa hill and brought my children also to Karongi FM hill". Let me skip three lines to move faster. "I stayed at Karongi FM hill up to about 21st April 1994".My question is as follows: did you stay on Karongi FM hill between 15th April 1994 and 21 April 1994 without moving?

Every time that one thought about it, you know, we were in difficult times.

            <p>I explained to you that I never heard Ndindabahizi's name on the radio. I told you that the meetings were being held around the roadblocks; that's where the people were, the members of the population were, and that's where we saw the vehicles, and that's how we came to realise the reason for the presence of those vehicles, and we had to anticipate what was going to happen to us. As for the rest, we were running helter skelter, and then people were killed.</p>

            <p>In that house there was a radio set. As for my own set, I tried to listen to it when it was necessary, but there would come times when I would turn on my radio when the news had already passed. I thought about going to the place where my brothers were.</p>

            <p>As for returning to Karongi hill, that wasn't possible because soldiers had been sent. It was being said that the Inkontanyi wanted to take over the situation.

            <p>Mr. President, there was a technical problem. There was a switch, which was not switched the right way, so I will repeat, but I am looking at the French of the written statement, written by the Witness. It's on page 4 of that statement, last but one paragraph in the French version. And in the English it's also page 4 of the statement, paragraph 5 and it begins with the words; "Almost every day".</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>In your written statement before the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor you stated almost every day Gitwa hill was attacked, but these attacks were small, and Tutsi people taking shelter there used to resist the attack". I wanted to know to which period of time you were referring when you say; "Almost every day". Was it between the 15th of April 1994 and the 26th of April 1994?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>This means from the 18th of April, it was on that day that an attack was launched which was repelled. Secondly - subsequently, I beg your pardon, subsequently from the 23rd, 24th, there was another attack until there was the major attack. It was during this period of time that almost every day there was an attack -- there was an attack launched. It wasn't every day that there would be an attack but there were four attacks. As you can see, in this period of time they were very close to one another. So from the 15th -- from the 18th up to the 26th, it would be in that time.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>So could we say that on the 18th of April 1994 to the 27th of April 1994 you were almost every day the subject of an -- attacks on Tutsi civilian population which had taken refuge there?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>I explained that when these attacks were launched they were trying to assess the strength of the refugees. It's clear that in these attacks people were killed, and there were also victims amongst the assailants.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>You are talking about the attacks on Karongi, but I don't think I mentioned any attacks which were launched on Karongi hill. I didn't say that.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>No, I didn't say that you were attacked -- that you referred to or mentioned those attacks, but I was just seeking information from you. So there were no attacks on Karongi hill during that period of time, is that correct?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>No, no attack was mounted on Karongi. To the contrary, I am telling you that soldiers were being sent, but that was an exaggeration. People were talking about the Inkotanyi, but we were in fact seeing people who had taken refuge, people who had taken refuge at that place, but it was said that it was the Inkotanyi who had taken refugee there.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>No, no, there were not that many refugees. It was said that the refugees who were in Gitwa were going to take over the Karongi station, therefore communication was going to be hindered, but this was a way -- this was an exaggeration so that people can become furious and that they increase their strength, so that they go to kill those people who were there, and that's what happened on the 26th.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. Witness. In the same paragraph as the one that I had referred to a moment ago, you said: In the group, some people like me used to go to nearby places to collect more information about possible attacks". Can you tell me what you meant? What was the object of those missions for information gathering, as it were?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>I will answer you. It was an important mission because this enabled us -- we became to know where the attackers were coming from as well as the people, the inhabitants who were not supporting these attacks, and we were thus able to know the places where the attackers were coming from.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>During these fact-finding missions did you have to go away from Gitwa hill, to go towards the attackers so that you could get better information regarding their numbers, for instance?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>This information could not be collected or gathered by one single individual. There were people who needed to go and look for the information, and since Gitwa was surrounded by more than three secteurs -- Gitwa is located in Rubanzo, next door there's Gitetsi, Gitarama secteur, and Bishura and Kangabiro as well as the Rubanzo secteur -- so, you will realise that there must have been many people who needed to go and try and find information from all corners, and it was not to me alone that that task was assigned.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Let's go back to the day on which you claim you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on the 23rd April 1994. Were there any civilians on the road that you saw arrive?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>When he arrived there were some members of the population who were manning the road, but there were others yet who came from farther a field, they were fewer, but in fact they organised themselves. The members of the population organised themselves when they saw the vehicles arriving. </p>

            <p>It was a house, which was still standing. It was intact. It was a house which was made of wooden planks, and it was by the roadside. In fact if someone had gone in that direction I would have to run away into the forest, into the middle of the forest.</p>

            <p>Yes, that house was visible. I told you that it was a drinking place, and that can't be very far from the road. In fact you needed to make it easier for people on the road to come by that house.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>I stated that I didn't need to be behind the house all the time. I was trying to look from one corner of the house, and through the trees I could see what was being done, what was happening.</p>

            <p>I would like to answer you. You know, you can understand quite a lot of things when you speak in Kinyarwanda. I suppose the same applies to French, but in fact, he told them that they needed to use their weapons. There's no really difference from what I said today. Maybe there's one or two words which are different, but the meaning remains the same. I do not see why you would ask me that question. Please understand that it's the same meaning, the main -- the same significance.</p>

            <p>In fact, the meaning of my question was that you had heard Emmanuel Ndindabahizi speaking at length and said many words. So, I'm wondering whether you were sure that from where you were hiding you heard all that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi said. </p>

            <p>Yes, firearms were used. There was another attack that I referred to, that of the 18th, and that attack was led by one Musema, a former director of the Gisovu factory. The attackers tried attacking us, but they did not succeed. I thought to myself that they were trying to gauge the force -- the strength of the refugees and then, subsequently, there was a large-scale attack which I spoke about.</p>

            <p>Mr. President, I have a question, and only one, to put to the witness in respect of his testimony in the Musema case. I believe the registry can make available to the Judges the witness's testimony during the Musema case. You already have the statement. I'm going to use the English statement, and the Bench and the Office of the Prosecutor are English speaking. I also requested that copies be made available to the -- copies of the transcripts be made available to the interpreters.</p>

            <p>"You were saying that you had left on the 20th -- you had left your previous hiding place on the 20th of April. Why did you leave that place?"Answer: "It is because a friend I was living with wanted me, given the fact that those he'd asked to come and help him did not know me and they could kill me."Question by the Prosecutor: "Maybe I can clarify that for you. Would I be correct in saying that the friend that you were staying with at Karongi had asked for some reinforcements and before the reinforcement arrived you thought it sensible that you left because the others would not sanction you being there; is that correct?"You answered: "He told me to leave because he could not stay there alone because those with whom he was working had gone to another place."Question: "Therefore, you were alone there?"Answer: "I was there with my family and no one else."Let us pause at this stage. Witness, did you understand what I have just read to you?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I understood.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>I would like to continue for a while. The next question was: "Did you feel abandoned; is that what you mean to say?" Answer: "Abandoned by whom?"Question by the President: "By your friend."Answer: "It was a way of helping me because the reinforcement he had asked for, if those people had arrived, he would not have confidence in them. So it was a way of helping me."Question by the President: "I see. Thank you."Question by Mr. Phillips: "And would I be correct in saying that you left that place and sought refuge in the bush with your family; is that correct?"Answer: "Yes."Another question: "Whilst you were in bush did you witness another attack?"Answer by the witness: "There were no other attacks."Now, then, Witness, you have just said that there was an attack and there were victims among people on the 24th of April, and you also said that another attack made victims not only among the people but also among the attackers on the 25th April; whereas, in the Musema case you testified that there was no attack before the 26th of April. Are you able to explain whether or not the attacks of the 24th and 25th April actually existed?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>I can explain that if I am given the opportunity. I believe I explained extensively these attacks. To start with, you made reference to the time when the people working with my friend left. In fact, they were involved in looting, but I don't want to go into that. If they left, it was because they -- that was in their interests. When my friend realised that he was alone and that rumours had been circulated to the effect that the refugees were preparing to take over the Karongi antenna, questions were put to him in that respect, and he answered that he was not with anyone, and at that stage they wanted to give him military reinforcement but, given the circumstances, I do not think that soldiers were going to save me. And I can't say anything about that.So, as I said, there were smaller scale attacks which took place. So, when you say there is a contradiction in my testimony, I made reference to an attack which took place on the 18th and other small-scale attacks. And I don't know if you made reference to the attack of the 18th.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>The attacks which took place on the 24th and 25th April -- you clearly answered in the Musema case that there was no attack before the 26th April, and I wanted your explanation on this point. That is all.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>What I can say is that the person who recorded my testimony, if he said I said nothing on this, it's because my testimony was not properly recorded. I recall yesterday when I said that the French came in May -- you said I said that the French came in May, but that was not what I said. I said that they came probably after the 26th of the month of May. But I did not have the opportunity to check these documents. So I am just giving an example of what could have happened in that case.There is a line which you pointed out to me where you said that I said that the French saved me in May. That also reminds me of that passage because, as we all know, the French were not yet in the country in May. That mistake is contained in that document, so I will give the same explanation regarding the -- the same explanation as I gave in respect of the mistake we met yesterday.</p>

            <p>I can say that he played an important role because when a leader carries out a distribution of weapons and issues orders, he does not have to use these weapons personally; but if you understand very well the concept of responsibility, then you will understand that he played an important role in the genocide.</p>

Before this court somebody was brought -- was accused -- was brought before this court and I was called upon to testify, but I have not testified in any other case in the Rwandan judicial system in relation to the events that -- or the genocidal events that occurred.</p>

We were many and we had to talk about one individual who had nothing -- who is not linked to this case before this Court. It's a matter relating to people in Kibuye. I was interviewed by an assistant prosecutor of the court of first instance in Kibuye. I was, therefore, not interviewed by Gérard Gahima. At that time Gérard Gahima was visiting the office of the prosecutor and he had reason to visit the office of the prosecutor, but I was not summoned by Gahima and those who were with me were also not summoned by Gahima.

            <p>Mr. Witness, does it not appear strange to you that a minister, like Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, specifically came to Gitesi with soldiers to distribute weapons to people who already had some? Would he not rather distribute firearms?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>That is not a problem, in my opinion. Let me explain the situation to you. He said he came to distribute some machetes, but I spoke about a box of military uniforms which had to be distributed. Possibly -- it's even possible that guns were there and that they were waiting to be distributed, but they were members of the population with guns; so how did they get the guns? So to say that he came to distribute just machetes is not surprising. What we should focus on is that he did something and that led to certain consequences.</p>

            <p>Let me repeat my answer, just in case you did not understand. I did say that I knew him when he used to come on holidays as a secondary school student. In '68, '69, I was a student at Kirambo school which is neighbouring to his residence. But ask him if at the time the Kirambo school was not close to his residence. If he tells you the contrary, then you can say I am lying.</p>

            <p>You say: "I know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi well. I'm sure I can still recognise him today. We are natives of the same secteur, Gitesi. I remember that since 1992 Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, came and held public meetings in his cellule at the ... centre." -- I don't want to mention the name of the centre so as not to reveal your identity. "I did not attend these meetings, but afterwards people told me what they had been told.

            <p>Mr. Besnier, it was very good that you didn't read the centre, but was not so good that you referred to the office. So we have to strike the reference to the office in both the video system and in the transcripts. That element will be put under seal then. So, the transcripts will read, "I was always at my work place in Kibuye town", and then it goes on. Please proceed.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>I'm going to give you a simple example. I'm using the date of the 26th -- in other words, the last day, the day which I have said I will never, ever forget -- because there were thousands of people who died and these people were innocent people. So, let me begin with the 26th on which there was a large-scale attack. On the 25th -- in other words, before the 26th -- there was a surprise attack and on the 24th there was a smaller-scale attack. On the 23rd that was the day of the distribution of the material. I will stop there but, if you will, I can repeat the answer I have just given, if that's not a waste of time for you.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>These photographs have not been shown to me before today. But the answer that I can give in terms of what these pictures relate -- and I'm not doubtful at all about what I am going to say. I'm going to give you as much explanation as I can on these photographs. I can see a place, which I believe I recognise quite well. It is a place at which there is a kind of road, and towards the top I see a stable where cattle were kept. I can see trees; I think this is the forest and the house where I was. You can see pillars above the road, and a kind of mount. I went to this location with investigators, and the only thing I mentioned is that that is where I was hiding, but the house had been destroyed. We had been waiting for assistance to get the house rebuilt. And since we didn't get that, we were using these poles or these pillars as firewood. That is where I was. And I think from there I can see the road. I can see my signature below. And I see the figure K0181533 on this sheet of paper. I, therefore, believe that I'm not wrong, and that this is the photograph about which you are asking me questions.</p>

            <p>That is possible. Can you do that please?If there are no more questions from the Prosecution, just for the record, I note that the parties have not requested that the written statements of this witness, or any other witness for that matter, be placed automatically before the Chamber as an exhibit. So, for instance, these three documents relating to this witness have not been exhibited. But in view of the fact that reference was made to a particular month when the French came in one of the statements, namely, the statement of 2001, that was the point mentioned by you, Mr. Kapaya, and it was also briefly mentioned during cross-examination, I think just to put it on record that I noted that in the witness statements dated the 13th of January 1999, where there is also a reference in the last sentence concerning the witness rescued by French soldiers, and there I note that the witness says, "I continued to hide from the attackers until I was rescued on the 11th of July by French soldiers, who took us to a certain camp". It is not very important matter, but I just thought that the record should reflect this. Mr. Witness, the Gitwa hill you were hiding during this period, in what commune was it?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cjy">
            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>Well, with regard to the commune, I was still in our commune of Gitesi in the hills which are near the place where I lived, in the secteur which neighbours the place where I live. Gitwa was a place where one couldn't really hide. It was almost a desert like place, and one could find dead bodies there and heads of victims. There had been many killings there, and as people were being killed their bodies decomposed, and the attackers continued to loot and to rejoice about their work. But some attackers were also -- were still on the lookout and would go into the bushes to look for any possible survivors, and sometimes, they did find survivors.</p>

            <p>Your Honour, there is a distinction between seeking for clarification on a matter that has been raised by either party. And there certainly is clearly a different matter for the Trial Chamber and, indeed, the Bench to raise an issue entirely on its own; they are two separate matters. And the impression I get from the proceedings yesterday and today, was that this matter was not directly confronted by any of the parties.

            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you. I wish to say something, I will be very brief. I thank you very much, Mr. President. But I have some concerns which I want to express to you, Mr. President. And they are the following: My concerns in the conclusion of the presentation of my testimony, you have asked me to not share this with anyone. When a secret is divulged, it no longer remains a secret. I wish to tell you one thing. You do your job very well, but you know there can be obstacles which may be of hindrance to us as witnesses, but which may not be evident to you as Judges. We, who are outside of this Chambers, we have problems. I'll give you a few concrete examples. Defence counsel stated that I had said that there was no attack, and I answered that my statement was not well taken down, because I gave as an example the place in my written statement where I had -- where there was mention made of French being in Rwanda in May, whereas the French was not there then, that is something that was well-known. Yet in my statement, it was stated that they were there in May, but I will not come back to that. What I wish really to say is this: Delegates from the Tribunal called us to the town, and they met us at -- on the veranda of the office of the mayor of the commune. Everyone was present at the mayor's office, and they could see what we were doing. I think this should be corrected, because it is a procedure which may bring about insecurity on our part. This is done on a determined date. I can mention the date to you. I will not mention the names of the individuals involved, but these are persons who have committed a mistake; a mistake which has arisen in the proceedings. I wish to also raise another point. Someone came, and he said that he was part of the Ndindabahizi Defence team. I have proof of what I am saying. He was looking for Defence witnesses. You know that in a trial there are Prosecution witnesses and Defence witnesses, and it depends on what one knows about the Accused. So this person came, and I don't know whether in the Rules of the Tribunal this is allowed; in other words, it is the Prosecutor who contacts us; does he have the right to go and contact Defence witnesses in the Ndindabahizi case? What I'm telling you about did happen, and I have the evidence; I was not the only person contacted, there were other friends who were also contacted. I have another issue to raise within the framework of our security and safety. You say that everything should be done in confidentiality, and you ask us to speak the truth and not to be indirect in what we say. But when we are not indirect in what we say, there is no longer confidentiality; there is no secret. So if Defence counsel for Ndindabahizi tells me that I didn't mention this or that, if I answer him, he doesn't keep these answers to himself. This is information which I am providing which goes out and cannot be held back again. This is what I wanted to say, Mr. President, Your Honours. I thank you. The name of the organisation for which I was working, and the time during which I was working there, and people will understand who the witness is. I think since he mentioned this, he is putting me in a difficult situation, and yet he is a lawyer himself.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, for raising these issues. When it comes to the first matter, namely, whether it was easy to observe some of you at your place of origin, that is something that the Prosecutor is looking into whether there was a mistake or not. We heard that previously in the courtroom. And I understand that the laws in connection with the witness protection unit make sure that things like that do not happen. As to the second question, whether the Ndindabahizi Defence team or certain representatives for that team have contacted you, I note what you are saying. Please address your concerns to the witness protection unit. Could you just indicate when this episode took place, Mr. Witness, according to your recollection?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CJY:</speaker>
            <p>I think I know the date. I had mentioned it on a piece of paper, but when I was to travel, I was a bit in a hurry and I wasn't able to find the piece of paper again. I wasn't alone; I think this affects at least three witnesses. There was a witness who was called, he was far away, and he was transported on a vehicle. But I was close by, and another witness was also very close and was working close to that place. So these are three people. And I think that these three people are going to be mentioning this matter to you. So we shall give you the date. I do not know the person who came to contact us. But the person who contacted me to meet this other person at a given place, I wouldn't say it is an office, I'm not going to mention the place, but let's say that it was a place where there was a bar. I know the person who asked me to go to that location. So I'm requesting that you follow this matter up closely, because if there were ever to be any problem, these people should be held responsible, or they should be made accountable. And that the person who was looking for us should be known -- should be known. We need to know who was looking for us. I know this person physically, but I do not know his name. But the one who came to me, the one who was the intermediary, the go-between, who made us meet the other person, I know that person very well and I know that person 100 per cent.</p>

            <p>Yes. Now, Mr. Witness, rest assure that this is being followed up. Whenever such allegations are made, we are following them up. And I can assure you that in this particular case, I have already been in touch with the witness protection unit to investigate the matter, because similar allegations have been made by other witnesses. So rest assure, and if you would kindly provide specific information about this to witness protection unit. When it now comes to your third point, then it is true that there was a slip of the tongue here in this session, today, but that was obviously inadvertent, counsel excused himself, and the information was placed under seal and delete from the record of the Court video system. So you can be confident that this information will not be disseminated. Thank you very much, Mr. Witness. And we wish you a safe journey home. And if the registry could kindly accompany the witness out of the courtroom, after having drawn the curtains, please? </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Actually, Your Honour, I hadn't considered the nature of this witness's testimony. In that regard, I would invite Your Honours to look at pages 96 -- I take that back. Look at -- yes, if you look at pages 96 through 101, it becomes terribly apparently that this nature and, indeed, the nature of his testimony has a great bearing on his area of residence presently. I'm more worried about his present location than I am about his location in 1994. The witness still resides in that location. And that location forms the essence -- the essence -- the very essence of his testimony. And whilst I make the application for this particular witness, it is going to be the same for the one that comes after him as well.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Could you just -- we have page 96 in front of us, now. Could you just indicate the paragraph where it is particularly transparent?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, if I refer you to page 96 itself, to paragraph seven where it says addresses as the starting point. Aside from the place of birth, Your Honours, look at the current residence and glance across to the residence in April of 1994. It then becomes apparent that the witness hasn't moved and that cellule also has some bearing with the Accused person. So you see, he talks about events in that location, it is the location where he still resides. He has to mention people who also still reside in that location. And it then becomes very obvious who he is. And then I also invite Your Honours to look at paragraph five, which details his ethnic group, increases the likelihood of repercussions following his testimony, Your Honour. A follow-up question which I know is perhaps on Your Honour's lips is, how much of this testimony am I seeking to exclude. The honest answer is all, because I fear -- I fear to delve into matters that may eventually, unconsciously, either by virtue of his replies or my state of excited ness reveal his identity. So I regret that I'm going to have to ask for the entirety of his testimony to be excluded. And I do that under the provision of Rule 79 <stage>(A),</stage> little two, Your Honour. </p>

            <p>All right, but what we were about to say here was that having looked at the statement, and in view of the submissions by the OTP, it is clear that the safest is to decide to hear this witness in a closed session, because the combination of the elements may, very well, reveal his identity. So I'm sorry to ask the audience, kindly, to leave the public gallery during this witness' testimony. This is exceptional; usually we hear it in open session, but we have to be sure that nothing happens to our witnesses. Thank you very much, indeed. </p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Your Honours. Following on from the witness's comments, I seek to make an application pursuant to Rule 79 <stage>(B)</stage> -- sorry, Rule 79 <stage>(A)</stage>
            <stage>(ii)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure for an in camera session in relation to the testimony of Witness CGE. The basis of that request is to protect this witness's identity, consequently his security, to ensure his security following his testimony in this courtroom. I did point out yesterday in relation to my motion concerning the previous witness, CGF, that I would be making a similar request in relation to this witness and indeed the one that comes after this witness. The essence of the application is that the witness still resides in the particular cellule where the events that he will be testifying about took place. He resided there in 1994, I believe, and I believe he still does so now. In particular, can I refer Your Honours to page 103 of your bundle of witness statements and, in particular, to paragraph 7 of that page? Therein you would see the current location where he resides and, indeed, the location where he resided in 1994 remains the same, and that has some bearing on the nature of his testimony because the events did take place in that locality and nowhere else. In relation to how much of his testimony I am seeking to exclude, I'm afraid I would be seeking to exclude the entirety of his testimony, for the reasons that I have pointed out already. </p>

            <p>As soon as I was in the bushes, I went into that house at night and my wife would give me food, and she was -- she would inform me about the areas which were supposed to be burnt down, so I had to leave those bushes. So that means at one point in time I went to another secteur, given the fact that the Tutsis who were living there had been killed.Approximately in the month of May, I hid near the bridge, but that must have been near the end of the month. That person, Mr. Ndindabahizi, came to that roadblock, and he stopped there, and he spoke to Hassan Byiyingoma who was at the roadblock and had a grenade. He asked that person, "Are you here alone?" Hassani called to the others and said, "Here is Minister Ndindabahizi. He has arrived." Even those who were in the bar next door came to the roadblock. He was in the middle of these people. There were vehicles. The second vehicle was green, and it was on board that vehicle that were tools. That's how Hassan Byiyingoma and one Mirasano and another named Abdullah took those machetes. When they did that, he told them this: "As for Tutsi women married to Hutus, have you killed them?" And they replied in the negative. He said then, "Kill them, because otherwise they will poison you." That was the advice he gave them. And he went towards -- to the vehicle which was in front, I do not with which persons it was, and he continued towards Kibuye. The members of the population shared out the machetes, and in the evening I left that place and went to hide elsewhere until my wife came to tell me that the French had arrived, and she took me to the French. </p>

            <p>If you just listen to my questions and just answer as best you can. Thank you.When was it that you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi at this roadblock near this bridge? When was it, period, date? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>I do not recall the exact date, but it was towards the end of the month of May because roughly four to five weeks later the French military aircraft arrived in Rwanda, and my wife came and told me that it was the French who were looking for the survivors. In other words, Ndindabahizi came to the bridge towards the end of May and then went to Kibuye. This was the time when practically everybody had been exterminated, and there were only Tutsi women who had married Hutu men. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Right. Now, you described the arrival of the French. Now, can you help us with this? Do you know which month the French had arrived in Kibuye? Do you recall when they arrived? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>You know, when you live in the bush, you do not know how to keep track of the dates. I was in hiding. I was very dirty. I was in dirty clothing, and I had a stench about me. I think the French came four to five weeks later. It's at that time that my wife told me that the French were looking for survivors. If you calculate all this properly, you can deduce the date of the arrival of the French. As for myself, given the circumstances, I wasn't able to know the date. </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>So in your mind, did the French arrive in Kibuye in the month of July or in the month of June? That's, rather, what I asked you, Witness. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>It was in the first week of July. Actually, it was between the last week of June and the first week of July. I think you yourself can look for the date. I really wasn't concerned about that at the time because I was concerned -- I was trying to survive, and so in those conditions one wouldn't be able to keep track of dates. </p>

            <p>He gave orders such that those women were to be killed. That surprised me, of course, but Tutsi women who had married Hutu men were, at the time, killed by their own husbands. That was something that actually happened. There's a man known as --</p>

Can the Accused deny that one Gatwa did not kill his second wife with a machete? Furthermore, it was the children of that second wife who had Gatwa arrested because he killed his wife with a machete.</p>

            <p>They had not yet been killed because their wives had defended -- their husbands had defended them.

The vehicle stopped, he opened the door to the car, and he came down. I didn't really pay much mind to find out how many people were in the car in the front.

I saw him standing at the time when he came out of the vehicle, so I wouldn't be able to tell you whether he was the driver.The vehicle was parked in -- facing Kibuye, and he came down from the right-hand side, so I wouldn't be able to say whether he was driving or not. There were people around the vehicle. Maybe those people could tell you precisely whether he was the driver. But as for myself, I never came near the vehicle; otherwise, I would be risking death.</p>

I wasn't attentive enough to know whether it was the front or the back door, but I was only able to see him because he was in the middle of the crowd giving them advice.

            <p>I was quite close by there. Actually, I came to that place to see whether I could find a way of getting to my father-in-law's house. Indeed, since it was said that there were no more Tutsis in the area, I preferred to hide in that area. I remained there, and I was about 30 metres away. There was a bush quite close to a banana grove, and that's where I was lying down, and I could see the Accused giving advice to those in attendance. In the evening, as night fell, I left. I went home and I told my wife, "You know, Tutsi women who have married Hutu men are going to be exterminated, and your sister-in-law is one of those Tutsis." So I told my wife, "We need to leave, to go and hide in the bushes." It was my wife who, during the war, would keep me informed of the development of the conflict. </p>

            <p>He stopped at that place -- I'm repeating what I've already said. So he stopped, and he talked to Hassan Byiyingoma, who was manning the roadblock and who was carrying grenades. We, in fact, took those grenades away from him at the end of the war.The Accused asked whether he knew him, and Hassan said, "Yes, I think I remember who you are. I think you are Ndindabahizi, and you are a minister." And the Accused said, "Where are the others?" In fact, the others who were manning the roadblock were lying close by the bridge because they were on the lookout to see whether there were Tutsis in vehicles that went by. If there were any Tutsis, they would come as one man to attack those Tutsis. So the Accused spoke to Hassan, and Hassan beckoned to the others who came at the same time. Those who were at the roadblock said, "The minister has arrived." They came out quickly from the bar, and they came to the bridge. At that bridge, there are two bars. There were two bars then and there are still two bars. So people who were drinking at those bars came -- there were many -- and the Accused spoke to them, giving them advice. And immediately those in attendance took the machetes -- no, I'm sorry. Three of the people in the crowd took the machetes from the vehicle, and when the Accused left, they distributed them to the rest of the group. </p>

            <p>He was speaking in Kinyarwanda since he was speaking to Rwandans, and most of the people who were listening were farmers who had not gone far in their schooling. So, they speak Kinyarwanda, and therefore the Accused spoke Kinyarwanda to them.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>No, he was not using a megaphone, but his voice could go far, and when you are speaking to a large crowd you speak out loud.

            <p>He gave orders to one Hassan to offload the machetes, and when the machetes were distributed, he told them what they should do with the machetes. Subsequent to that he distributed the machetes, and that was after he had given them advice.</p>

Or is it the following: Machetes are offloaded from the vehicle; they are distributed; then he gives the advice? Which of those options is indicative of what you observed, Mr. Witness?</p>

            <p>Your Honour, I am going to need the registry to draw the curtains on this side. I want the witness to walk over to the projector. The sketch 4 in the Prosecution Exhibit 2 is generated by this witness -- well, it is generated by my office, but with the help of this witness. So I just wish to take him through this sketch and to further assist Your Honours in locating where he was.Mr. Registry, excuse me, can you also draw this up to about half.Your Honours, I refer you in particular to Prosecution Exhibit P2, sketch 4, which is numbered L0019878. Can I also have the technicians zoom in on the projector, please, so we can all see it on our screens.</p>

Actually, he was someone who was doing a course. He was not a teacher at the school, he was only doing a course, and after the course he got employment elsewhere. He was not a teacher, he was someone who was following a course. It was subsequently when I become a young man that I knew him very well, and at that time he was working at Trafipro.

I don't know whether the person went to look elsewhere for witnesses, but some of the people who were questioned by him refused, but we did not pay much attention to what he was saying, because it seemed to us that he wanted to use us through corruption, because that kind of corruption does not exist in our country. Someone who tries to corrupt or be corrupted can only do that once.</p>

            <p>No, this is an incident which took place last month. I don't know, you can carry out investigations, and people will tell you that ************** came in search of people, but we refused, because in our country there is no corruption. There is no longer any corruption. You do what you do in hiding, but you end up getting caught. There is no longer any corruption in our country, and that is why we did not associate ourselves with him.Furthermore, when he did this, he made people go even to the commune office. I don't know whether he is present. I am referring to the lawyer in question. In fact, instead of contacting that person for looking for Defence witnesses, they need to use another person.

When an animal leaves its hiding place, people shout out when they see it. When ******************** was being looked for - he is not my neighbour. Between his residence's home and mine there is a distance that one can cover in two hours. He is from Karongi. I don't know whether he knew Ndindabahizi. Look for someone else, someone who is a neighbour, or speak to Ndindabahizi. I think we were being contacted, and three of us were contacted.I met ************** who was coming from Kibuye. He lives in Kibuye. He told me that he was made to come to the commune office, and when he was asked questions about Ndindabahizi, he came out of that room. He said that he didn't want anything to do with Ndindabahizi and that he was doing his business in Kibuye.As for me, I was waiting for schools to open, and I was saying that before the children go back to school they needed to do some work. So we said no to him. We felt that one wanted to involve us in some kind of fraudulent manoeuvres. Even people who killed our kith and kin didn't give us anything. They confessed and they were released, and we are living together on the hill, colline.</p>

            <p>Mr. President, I think we have the pleasure of announcing that we have identified Mr. François **************. I have a document here which is a statement from the Office of the Prosecutor. This is K0225036. It is a statement which is not included in the list of witnesses who were supposed to be called during the trial before this Court, but it was disclosed to the Defence. The witness whose name -- I must say will not testify, he is not in the final list produced by the Prosecution. However, this witness has given his address, and he also mentioned the addresses of members of his family. On page 2 of that witness statement I can see that the brother of the witness that I'm referring to is Mr. François *************** who lives in Kayenzi secteur. So, we are dealing with the brother of a witness for the Prosecution. I am surprised about leakages, because there is a document from the Prosecution, and the parents of the Prosecution witness, or relatives, obviously know about this witness.I believe, Mr. President, this document should be submitted to those involved in the investigations which are ongoing.</p>

Now, even the Accused in this case, I'm not accusing him of having killed anyone, I'm only talking about the events that occurred at that time in relation to him. </p>

            <p>But is it true that you testified against people who were at the roadblock that you referred to a while ago, the roadblock at which you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in 1994?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. I am not accusing him of having killed anyone, I am ascribing the loss of property which occurred and the grenades at that roadblock. When you tell the authorities that so-and-so has a weapon which can occasion loss of human life, it is not the same thing as saying -- when you say that somebody has attacked another person with a weapon, it is not the same. And when you are talking about somebody carrying a weapon, when you report somebody who is carrying weapons, you want the authorities to recover the weapons.</p>

            <p>My question is: is it the people who were at the roadblock? You can answer yes or no, and can you be concise in your answers? Another question: do you recall in which year you testified before the Kibuye courts against these people who were at the roadblock?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>I do not recall the year. That is not part of my concerns. If I reported these people, it is because they were carrying weapons and I wanted weapons to be taken from them. But the people who committed these crimes, including those who looted my property, are still alive today, and we live together.</p>

            <p>But, Counsel, you are asking me to answer only the questions you ask me, but I have the impression that the testimony given in Rwanda has nothing to do with the Ndindabahizi case before us. You want me to give you information which I do not have in my mind now. The testimony in courts in Rwanda have nothing to do with what is going on in this case. Cases that have been tried in Rwandan are being tried in Rwanda, or do you want to decide -- or do you want to adjudicate in the cases being tried in Rwanda?I am in a case being tried here. Ndindabahizi has not been -- charges have not been brought against Ndindabahizi in Rwanda. What is happening in Rwanda is known to the President, Kagame, so you probably need to go and talk to him.</p>

            <p>Well, there is a procedure, a legal procedure. Talk to the Kibuye prosecutor. He himself used to tell us, "Listen, bring charges against people who are present, not people who are absent". And that person could have drowned in the lake, could have been killed in a plane crash. Let's talk about the Kibuye préfet. He is the one who used to put at the disposal of young men who were shuttling among the hills and burning the hills, making -- putting vehicles at their disposal to commit their acts. And most of these people have been arrested and they are in prison.So, if that person is found, he will be brought before the courts to be tried, but until then, when the person is not present, you cannot bring charges against him.You can consult the laws in the books and you can see that there is a legal procedure to be followed to the effect that you cannot accuse people who are not present.</p>

So, I remained at home and I saw attackers as they came. My wife had already left. Now, to escape the attackers, I told them, "Here are our cattle which are being taken away by people which are not neighbours, because our cattle had never grazed in their fields. But you, who are our neighbours, can pursue them and catch them". So I was talking to other Hutus, I was a relative of some Hutus, and I'm saying, "We are going to look for other Hutus, and we are going to give them to you so that you can eat them". The attackers believed me and they told -- they believed that I was going to bring back the cattle. What I did instead was to follow my wife, and on my way I met my wife who was coming back with her brothers to save my life. And my wife told me, "Come, we are going to go to my parents' home". So I went to the parents of my wife, in other words, my in-laws, and I stayed there. </p>

            <p>On that day -- in other words, the second occasion, the second attack -- a group of attackers came, and it was my brothers-in-law who repelled them. There was a third attack from persons coming from my own secteur, and since you're asking me for details I'm going to give them to you.My wife was outside the house together with her children. The attackers wanted to attack the children, to kill them, and my wife told them, "You want to kill these Tutsis, but he is not the father of my children. My children are born of Hutus. If you kill my children, I'm going to ask for reinforcement, and we are going to fight". Among the attackers there were people who had received weapons from the state, and they said, "We are going to search the house to see whether your husband is in there". My wife said, "You don't know whether my mother has made her bed, so let me go and check so that I can find the house is presentable". So my wife came and told me to go through the window. I went through the window and I escaped the attackers. I went to the hill, and I survived by wandering around in the hills.I told you that it was at night that my wife would bring me food to eat, and she told me the places which the attackers had the intention of attacking the day after or the two days after that. That's how I knew how, when the attackers -- where the attackers were going to descend, and that is how I was able to survive, although the war lasted a long time.</p>

So she came into the house and she said, "Go out. It's better for you to be killed outside than to be killed inside". So I left through the window. I don't know what happened subsequently. My wife remained with the attackers, but I do not know what happened. Later on she told me that, "The attackers looked for you in the house. They turned things topsy-turvy, and they didn't find you.

            <p>Counsel, if I were to tell you everywhere I went to hide, I would never come to the end of this testimony. First of all I went to hide by the shores of Lake Kivu. I was telling myself that I was preferring to throw myself into the lake rather than being killed by machetes. It was in the secteur in which my father-in-law lived. Later I went to hide by the river, and my wife would keep me abreast of the attackers' programs. Later on it was necessary to search the banks of the river, and she told me that -- my wife told me that I needed to find another hiding place. So some days later I went into the secteur, to my native secteur, because it was believed that all Tutsis had been exterminated in my secteur, and that's how I went back to my native secteur. I remained there. In fact, in my cellule the bushes had not been burnt down, because people believed that everyone had been exterminated in my cellule.So, with regard to what happened in my native secteur, I was able to see everything, when everyone had been exterminated and the attackers were dealing with the forests and the bushes in order to set them on fire. </p>

            <p>Please wait. And that was approximately how much time after you went through the window of your father-in-law's house?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>It's in fact from the middle of the month of April that I told you that I was in the bushes. I was like a hyena; you know, hyenas live in the bushes. At night I was brought food, but I would stay in the bush. Now, you're asking me how much time passed after I escaped the attackers at my father-in-law's. I wasn't able to count the days, Counsel; it was from the beginning -- from the middle of April until May, and I was in the bushes, and I tried to avoid roadblocks, and the people who were manning those roadblocks did know see me.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. My question is: how much time -- after escaping your attackers -- elapsed until you were at that roadblock for the first time? I am not asking you the time which has elapsed when you left your father-in-law's house and the time that you saw Ndindabahizi, no; I'm asking you about the first time that you went to that roadblock. When was that?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>I escaped from them in April. As for that roadblock, I passed by that roadblock in May, and I passed by it on two occasions, and there was about one week between the two occasions on which I passed by -- close by the roadblock.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Did you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that roadblock when you first passed by that roadblock or the second time you passed by the roadblock?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>The first time I passed by that roadblock, I saw a conseiller there and he was the one giving instructions according to which people were to spend the night at the roadblock. He asked Hassan Byiyingoma to stand up, whereas the others were sleeping. Now, after one week, during the second time that I passed by, that's when I saw Mr. Ndindabahizi.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>No. In that secteur -- in our secteur, I would pass by various places, because when people saw the traces of someone who had passed by there, it was quite easy for him to be followed, so I needed to be on the move constantly. Today I would be in one place, tomorrow I would find myself somewhere else. So, I passed by that roadblock, and one week later I came back by it.</p>

            <p>Yes, it was on those two occasions.

I told you that amongst the attackers who came on the second occasion, there was a man, a neighbour, who knew me, and whom I knew very well. As for the chronology -- chronology of events, you can do that when you're in agreeable circumstances. Do you think that you are going to have an advantage from this exercise? When you are faced with problems, how would you be keeping track of dates? It wasn't a marriage, it wasn't a wedding that I had attended for me to be able to give you a chronology of events.</p>

You stated, and I am referring to the third paragraph of your written statement: "The start of April 1994; I do not know the exact date. I remember that I was at home, together with my wife and four children, listening to the radio. It was announced on the radio that the president had died in a plane crash and the population were advised to stay at home and not to go to work." Let me stop there for now. Now, on that date, when you heard on the radio about President Habyarimana's death, would it be correct to say that, since we know that he died on the 6th of April 1994 in the evening, that this was the 7th of April that you were listening to your radio?</p>

I was trying to give you some points of reference, but I didn't have a calendar. If I had said that on such-and-such a date in May, that would be one thing, but I said "in the month of May."

I think I have repeated this on several occasions already. Now, as for dates, the dates that you are referring to, these are only some indications, some points of reference. I don't know, when you are in the bush and you are being assailed from all sides, you wouldn't be very interested in keeping track of dates or even remembering them.

            <p>Look closely at the distance separating me from the roadblock. I didn't approach it so that I could be killed. I was in the grass nearby between two places separated by 50 or 60 metres. There were several roadblocks which were erected, but your question is this: that I need to look for a place to go through so that I cannot be seen; in fact, it's like someone who is crossing a road when there is intensive traffic, there's several vehicles. This is in comparison to what I was doing, so it's not a matter of having to look for a roadblock where I was going to be choosing my place to hide, it's not that -- those were not the circumstances at the time, Counsel.</p>

            <p>I was looking for a passage to be able to get somewhere to look for something to eat. It was not my intention at all to hide in this place, Mr. President. I was looking for a passage, and when I realised that day was going to break I hid myself there so that I'm not seen until nightfall. And when it was dark again I decided to leave that place. So, my point is it was not my intention to hide myself next to that -- close to that roadblock. Let me repeat that I was looking for a passage when I realised that it was daybreak. I hid myself there. That was the second time I did that, and no one knew. So please understand me, Mr. President. Those are the circumstances under which I found myself.</p>

            <p>No, Mr. President, my question is which secteur is Mr. <stage>(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)</stage> conseiller of? I wish that the witness himself writes the name. </p>

            <p>Writing down the name of the secteur is not really going to be of assistance; having named that individual and having allowed the witness to draw a relationship between him and that individual really is neither here nor there.

            <p>If they were Interahamwes then it will be Hassan, who was carrying a weapon. There was also Abdullah and Mirasano; in other words, the others were members of the population who were being led by these chiefs, these leaders.</p>

            <p>You see, a minister is an influential person. Let's not even talk about a minister. Let's say a conseiller. When a conseiller arrives in a place the entire population is called. It is, therefore, not possible that a minister will arrive and a person manning the roadblock will not call the other members of the population. Everybody came and listened to him.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that one, Hassan Biyungoma, spoke to the people who were in the neighbourhood, as well as those in the bar. He told them, "Come, it is true."</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>No, he did not go into the bar. He called them from where he was, from the roadblock. In fact, an officer of his status cannot go to the ordinary citizens. He called them from the road, close to his vehicle.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>Well, he was not more than five or six metres from the bar. Everybody was there and when he spoke to them they came closer to him. They listened to what he was telling them, the instructions he was giving them, and then he went back, he left. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. Initially I identified him; and, secondly, they themselves said it when they said the minister has arrived. Now, with these two elements I can say that we had identified him. There's myself who identified him and the other persons, his collaborators, who also identified him.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Hold on a moment. Did you personally identify him or you identified him by hearing people say that the minister had arrived?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>He arrived at the place. The vehicle came to a stop. He opened the door of his car and came out. He greeted Hassan, asked him if he knew him. Hassan answered, "Yes, I remember you." And the minister said, "I am the minister." And when he said those words I tried to look closely at him to be able to identify him, and I realised that it was him. And the person I'm seeing today is that very same person I saw that day.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>You are now saying that he first spoke to Hassan Biyungoma, asking whether he knew him?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>Well, he exchanged a few words. Hassan Biyungoma spoke to the other members of the population, he felt it would be a vehicle with Tutsis aboard so that they can kill them. Hassan Biyungoma told him that it was the minister. So they came around, they off-loaded the weapons. I think I said this initially. And he told them what they should do with the weapons. I think I said this on several occasions.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>But you did not make the reference between Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and Hassan Biyungoma. While they were exchanging words of welcome, were they shouting out loud?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>Well, he spoke out loud, even Hassan Biyungoma spoke out loudly so that everyone, people in the neighbourhood of the bridge can come around. People speak in a low tone when they are bandits, thieves, but somebody who is doing his legitimate work speaks out loud because he doesn't have any problem.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>It is not a formal greeting. A minister will not go and embrace somebody of a lower status. He asked him what is happening? What is happening now? Now, an influential person would not engage into formal greetings when he's talking to ordinary members of the population. People expect only orders from such people.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>If I understand you clearly, in the stay of Ndindabahizi at that roadblock he and Biyungoma and the other members of the population did not stop shouting and screaming, is that correct?</p>

            <p>In less than a minute everybody had come around him, those who were lying down. There was no formality. Everybody ran to the place just like an order. What is the situation? And he answered in his own way. There was no conversation, as such, conversation between two individuals. </p>

            <p>Very well, Witness, you've told the Court that you were hiding about 35 metres away, that you were lying on the ground and that you covered yourself with grass.

          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>This is a bush about the height of this stand in this table in front of me.

            <p>Yes. These are bushes which grow along the road. Currently the road is tarred, but there are traces of these bushes. Unfortunately, it is not possible but if we go to the place I can show them to you. You can hide yourself there and spend hours there without being seen; even though people are passing close to the place you can hide yourself there for a long time without being seen by anybody. Unfortunately, it is not possible; otherwise, I would take you to the place and show you the place. There are still traces of these bushes.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cge">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGE:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, about the height of this table in front of me, and you can hide in there without being seen. Regarding hiding places, you hide yourself when there is a serious problem, so these are bushes which are about the height of this table. You can hide in there without being seen by anybody.</p>

            <p>The normal schooling age is six years, and at seven years you are in Primary 2. Besides, a child of five years who sees somebody often can recognise and identify the person. When he sees somebody often, he will -- he knows him, a child of five years.</p>

            <p>Yes. You can proceed, Counsel, I will ask you -- answer you. I stated that I went there when I was transporting coffee for my parents or when I went for provisions, but it wasn't every day that I went to Kibuye. If I was going to Kibuye, that would mean I was a street child, but it was once or twice a month that I would go there, and I had reasons for going there.</p>

I learned that in this period he lived in Kigali." Would it be correct to say, Mr. Witness, that you did not see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at any point in time since the time you were in your second year of primary school until April 1994? Would that be correct?</p>

            <p>I explained to you that I saw him again when he was working at Trafipro. I did not say that I never saw him again since I was in my second year of primary school. I saw him when he was working at Trafipro, but after that I didn't hear of him. But I just learned that he had become a minister, and I only learned of that in May during the war, and it was in May that I saw him.</p>

            <p>What I told you with regard to Trafipro is -- if I didn't say that in my written statement, I can tell you today, because one cannot say everything.

            <p>That is not of essence right now, but Mr. Ndindabahizi will contest having worked at Trafipro. Why do you say in your statement that you never saw Mr. Ndindabahizi between the time of the genocide? Why did you not say that you saw him on several occasions at Trafipro?</p>

            <p>He worked at Trafipro but only for a short time, and I didn't see him again. Since he was someone who was educated, he went up the grades.

            <p>I have a question before your re-examination. Mr. Witness, I wanted to take you back to the roadblock which you passed a second time. I just want some assistance. At what point did you realise that the person who had come out of the vehicle and was addressing the gathering was the Accused? Was it when you saw him get out of the car, was it when his name was mentioned by Hassan as they greeted, or when he was introduced? </p>

He knew the Accused, and he went to school in the Accused's native area. At Nyakatovo there is Protestant centre.

            <p>You said that you saw the Accused at Trafipro before 1994. Now, did you see that person in the 1990s or in the 1980s?</p>

            <p>I saw him during the first years of President Habyarimana's reign; subsequently, I didn't see him again. Later on, I was to learn that he became minister. I only saw him again at the time when he was presented as being minister. I didn't even know what portfolio he held. Normally in the 1970s, '75, '76, it was then that I saw him under President Habyarimana's regime; otherwise, his ascension into these various jobs I wasn't aware, because I was a mere peasant and, you know, he was someone who was intelligent, had gone to school, and he went up in grades.</p>

            <p>Just when President Habyarimana took power, because in 1970 he had not yet gone -- become president. But it was just at the beginning of President Habyarimana's regime that I saw him at Trafipro. Subsequently, I didn't see him because he went up in the ranks and that really wasn't of any concern to me because it wasn't of any interest to me.

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, we have -- there is a slight issue in relation to -- we certainly have -- well, let me answer Your Honour's question first. We certainly have Witness No. 11, who is a detained witness and its --his availability is subject to a 90bis order.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yeah, let me say that right away, that the 90bis order has been signed and finished. We had a little bit problem because the written motion didn't give a lot of details as to the basis for the conditions in 90bis, but we were able to receive supplementary information and now that has been dealt with. And let me say also to the Defence that the other motion which was mentioned last week, the protection of witnesses, has been disposed of. So both these motions pending in the Ndindabahizi case are now dealt with.Please proceed, Mr. Phillips.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>So we would have, for definite then, Witness No. 11, Witness No. 14. In relation to 14, there was an issue and I made representations to Your Honour earlier. The witness did arrive, turned out to be somebody with the same name but it wasn't the witness that we, you know, obviously by the time we compared the personal details with the witness on the ground it turned out to be somebody else. So, he is here in Arusha. He is not the person that we have asked them to bring. There is another witness with exactly the same name but with different particulars. So that's why we have -- we don't offer him to Your Honours this week. So we hope to get the real Witness 14.So that's 11, 14, the next witness is Witness 15, so that's dealt with already. Witness 16 is the witness that arrived -- that will arrive this evening if she hasn't already arrived, and the expert. We then have an issue with Witness 10 or Witness 17. Now, Your Honours will recall that I had represented to you last week that I was not proposing -- I was proposing not to call one or two of -- one of those witnesses, either CGB or CGD; they testify on the same event. The only reason why I would call CGB -- that is, Charlie-Gulf-Bravo -- which is No. 10, is that having perused the indictment, we have used the name of Tatiane Nyiramaritetie interchangeably with her real name. Whilst I'm satisfied about the evidence adduced in relation to that event, I am not satisfied that I sufficiently established that it is the same person that is referred to by those two names. And the only reason why I'd be calling Witness 10 before this Court is to establish that point, and that's simply because the other witnesses have said, "Well, we know she has another name but we don't know what that name is". And I didn't want to suggest that name to any of the other witnesses. Therefore, if my learned friends for the Defence are willing to stipulate that they accept that it's the same person that bears both names, then I can dispense with that witness. However, if they don't -- if they are not able to so stipulate, then I have to call Witness CGB to establish, just to establish that point. And that's really, honestly the reason why I'd be calling that witness, to establish that he knows that person by another name, Mukantabane, as well as Nyiramaritetie, which, if you look at the indictment, some paragraphs mention her by her nickname which at the time we drafted the indictment we had no way of knowing it was a nickname, but luckily we also allege the real name. So that's -- that's my dilemma in relation to Witness CGB. So, in effect, we have one, two -- another four witnesses left, without calling CGB.</p>

            <p>Seventeen, it's either or, Your honour. It's either I call CGB or I call CGD because they pretty much say the same thing.</p>

            <p>Does the Defence team want to say anything about this issue now, this question raised by the Prosecution?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Mr. President. In actual fact, we ourselves are aware of this problem and I was looking for the appropriate moment to talk about it. I think the problem goes beyond the identity of a person. The difficulty is the indictment itself. We have charges against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi during the death of Tatiane Nyiramaritetie, killed on a specific date, April 1994, paragraph 26 of the indictment. But we also have charges against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in relation to the death of Mukantabane in May 1994, and that is paragraph 27th -- 27 of the indictment. In other words, the confusion between Nyiramarietetie and Mukantabane are found in the indictment, but there are many charges -- different charges against Ndindabahizi at different dates. Well, I would be glad to know that Nyiramaritetie and Mukantabane are the same -- one and the same -- is one and the same person, but then that would impact on the indictment. If the Prosecutor would withdraw all paragraphs of the indictment that refer to Tatiane Nyiramaritetie and Mukantabane, then we would agree.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, it's not really a problem for me. I mean, this is just about calling either Witness No. 10 or Witness No. 17. The issue is now going beyond. Obviously it's -- I can deal with this problems in half and hour just by putting the witness in the box and asking a few questions, and it solves my problem. So the other issues raised by my learned friend are for closing arguments, and he is well within his rights to assume any legal or factual position that he wants to, but I have a dilemma which I want to solve, and it impacts on Your Honours' timetable. So the honest answer is that I will be calling Witness No. 10, following the representation made by my learned friend. I will drop 17 and call 10. And so, Your Honours will have 10, 11, 14, 15, 16. We will take Witness No. 15 tomorrow. We would take Witness No. 16 the day after, and it then remains to be seen when witness Nos. 10, 11, 14, can be brought to Arusha, certainly not this week. The earliest that I imagine they would come would be this Friday. Therefore, next week you would have 10, 11 and 14, plus the expert.</p>

            <p>I was at Gitwa Hill, which is close to the road; Ndindabahizi arrived around 2 p.m. in a white vehicle. There was another green vehicle. He was holding a grenade, and he had other grenades attached to his belt. Aboard the green vehicle, there were soldiers and Interahamwe, and there were grenades as well aboard that vehicle.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>These people came out. They had already come out of the vehicle, they parked the vehicle and they got close to him, and you understand that a meeting was going to take place there. When they got close to him, they stood at a distance, and Ndindabahizi then threw a grenade and we dispersed. There was a certain Jean who was the agronomist of the commune, and he said that, "Has Ndindabahizi also come to kill us?" We then left, because the Interahamwe were chasing us.These are the circumstances under which I saw Ndindabahizi. It was in the afternoon, not in the morning.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>He was the first to get out of his white vehicle together with his driver. I identified him because I had known him since the '80s. Well, obviously I hadn't seen him for a long time when he went to Kigali. I saw him again during the war after the death of President Habyarimana.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, in your statement of 6th of April -- of 4th June 2001, you state that you got the impression that Mr. Ndindabahizi was the leader of the attackers. Did you say that in your statement, Mr. Witness?</p>

            <p>When he -- when the attackers got close to him and they got together, since he was a minister, the agronomist -- Jean, the agronomist recognised him and said, "You have to run." There are soldiers and even Ndindabahizi has come from Kigali to kill the Tutsi." People were killed. Children and women were killed. I managed to escape, and we went to the Karongi antenna, and in the evening we left the place.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>It was Ndindabahizi, because he was the most influential personality there. He was a minister, and he was the leader.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>

            <p>No, there was nothing else. He was the first person to get out of the vehicle; he was the first person to throw a grenade. Following that, his men did the same and killed our people. He was the first to throw the grenade. If he had remained in Kigali, we would understand, but is it only in Kibuye that there are Tutsis?</p>

We didn't know where to go, and we realised that those who were expected to protect us were the ones who were killing us.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, my question is this: Before you ran, how long had you been observing Mr. Ndindabahizi, that is, before he threw the grenade that made you run away? For how long had you been observing him, that is, from the time he got out of the vehicle and to the time he threw the grenade. Can you help us with that?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>Not many minutes before these people started running after us. I saw the Interahamwe and the soldiers come out. They distributed the grenades. How do you expect us to remain there when we know that the situation is serious? Some were running faster than others. We did not have any weapons, so we could not fight back the attackers. So there was nothing to do apart from running.Normally, soldiers will ensure the security of the people. After the death of the president, there were ministers and members of parliament who attacked us. We had no protection, and the purpose was to appropriate our belongings. The person who killed the most number of people would be rewarded in terms of our belongings. Our fate was sealed at that time.</p>

            <p>I ran after the grenade was thrown, and there were a lot of people. The grenade was thrown on those people who were close to the one who threw the grenade. Following that the attackers surrounded us. Those being attacked spread around, they ran in various directions. There were even guns. There was a sub-machine gun positioned at the top of the hill and many people were killed as a result of the bomb that was thrown. There were various types of firearms. A lot of people were killed on that occasion.</p>

            <p>Can you wait a little bit, now, Witness? Can you wait a little bit? You see, you have a lot of information you want o tell us, but we have to take this step by step.Now, you just told us that you started to run after the grenade was thrown, and Mr. Kapaya's first question was the following: "For how long did you observe Mr.-ndindabahizi" -- or the person that you say is Mr. Ndindabahizi - "for how long did you observe that person until you started to run?" Was it after one minute, more than one minute, less than one minute? In other words, how much time passed -- I have not finished -- just a minute -- from the time when he got out of the car until you started to run. Can you please help us with that?</p>

            <p>No, on that day I did not see him.

A survivor, who was killed the following day, told me that he saw Ndindabahizi. On that day the Interahamwe had encircled the hills and we did not know where to go. There were so many attackers that we could not move. There was even no bush to hide in. I did not -- I therefore did not see the Accused at that place. If I had seen him I would have told you.

            <p>Are you referring to the period when I was in Bisesero? I spent four days at Gitwa and many people were exterminated there. So we went down to the other hills, lower down where there were ruins. In fact, most of the people had been killed at Gitwa, and there were very few survivors at Gitwa. It was the few survivors who then went onwards to Bisesero, and in the ruins we were able to find something to eat.When the Hutus of all the secteurs met, they decided to burn down the bushes and to chase away the survivors with the help of dogs. So after the four days following he attack on Gitwa, the night of the fourth day, the few survivors went by night to Bisesero, and therefore, to Muyira. And when we got to Muyira, what happened I have already described, and then the French found us there.So that is how the events developed. Subsequently, at end of the war, we were settled in the various communes and the Interahamwe -- the Hutus who had chased us were arrested by the soldiers in the bushes where they were hiding. They were arrested and put in prison. We were then able to go back to our ruins. That is how the events occurred.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, there were many attacks. We were flushed out of the bushes until the time when the Interahamwe stopped attacking us and Hutu civilians took over in order to look for the few survivors in collaboration with the bourgmestres and the conseillers of the secteurs. They set the bushes on fire and those who were lucky enough were not burned, and the French came at a given point in time to evacuate the wounded and take them to Zaire. We were assembled in the same place, we were fed and were put on a vehicle and we were transported to a place known as Gitarama.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. Witness. Please listen carefully to the questions. It is not necessary for you to go into a long explanation, just please be precise and give me short answers. I would appreciate that. Did you see at Muyira, that the attacks at Muyira Hill were of a larger scale than elsewhere?Did you notice that?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>At the time when we were chased from Muyira, the following day the attackers dispersed us from Muyira I can say that on those two occasions those were large-scale attacks, but, otherwise, there were several attacks and the whole hill had dead bodies on it.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, do you remember having made any written statements before the Tribunal's investigators, and if so, how many did you make?</p>

            <p>Well, people would come and question me. I didn't count the number of statements which I made. The investigators would come to see me, they would tell me, "You know, one day you may be asked to testify in Arusha." So I didn't count the number of times the investigators came to see me.</p>

            <p>Very well. The Defence only has two, and we have worked only on those two. There is one which is dated 4th June 2001, and the second is the 26th April 2001. So, in other words, just a little more than one month elapsed between the first and the second statements. Was it you who asked to be interviewed again by the investigators after your first statement, or is it the investigators themselves who asked you to return?</p>

            <p>Very well. I'm asking you the question, Mr. Witness, because in your first witness statement -- in other words, that of the 26th April 2001 -- you said that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was simply watching the fighting at Gitwa, but in the second statement you state that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi participated in the fighting, threw grenades and distributed machetes. Why did you wait for a whole month for you to make that revelation to the investigators?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>I'm still insisting on what I told the investigators from the first time that they came to see me. I don't know what you are talking about.</p>

            <p>Defence Counsel, do you think your representation to the witness concerning the first statement is absolutely correct; in other words, whether the statement of the 26th of April is absolutely clear as to how you summarised it? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. In fact, I'm going to quote from that statement in order to be specific. In the statement from the 26th of April the witness said in the middle of the statement --</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Page 172 of the French version and page 169 in the English version. Now, on page 172 -- 173 in the French version the witness says: "Throughout the attack Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was there, he was present, watching the fighting between the two belligerent parties".</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#the-english-interpreter">
            <speaker>THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:</speaker>
            <p>This is a free translation, because the interpreter has not yet found the English equivalent. I'm sorry, Your Honours.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>This French version, Maître, what are the first four words in French there on page 173? Is it "Pendant tout la durée de l'attaque"?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, you are quite right, sir, it is "Pendant tout la durée de l'attaque".</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>All right. So this would then be the last sentence, then, at the middle of the page; namely, counsel is drawing our attention to the English version, "The same afternoon", but then he is focusing on the last sentence of that paragraph which in English starts, "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack watching the fighting between the two adversaries". Mr Kapaya?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Your Honour. In the same paragraph, the third sentence.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. Without reading it out now, you are now drawing our attention to the third sentence in that paragraph? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. Actually it shows that what counsel has represented to the witness is not correct. It shows that Mr. Ndindabahizi didn't simply watch what was taking place.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So maybe we would have to see the whole paragraph in context. I suppose that is the solution here. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>I'm not sure that I have the same version as the Prosecutor and the Judges. I am referring to the document which is K0180696, that is my French version, and I do not seem to find the same paragraph in the English version.Oh, yes. I am at the sixth paragraph of the English version on page 169, paragraph 6.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. And what Mr. Kapaya is drawing our attention to is the third line in that paragraph, and possibly also the first sentence. So that is the problem if you focus on the last sentence.Could you please proceed, Maître, in a way which takes into account these elements? </p>

            <p>So, now, in the first statement, Mr. Witness, you stated that two vehicles, including that belonging to Mr. Ndindabahizi, arrived transporting Interahamwe. You also stated that Mr. Ndindabahizi came down from the vehicle with a grenade in his hand. You also said that the two vehicles, including the one Ndindabahizi was in, were transporting the Interahamwe. You further say they started attacking the refugees, first with grenades before they opened fire. You stated that the survivors sought refuge to the top of the Gitwa Hill and that the attackers remained until 4 or 5 p.m. and they withdrew between 4 and 5 p.m., and then you end up by saying in that paragraph that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was present throughout all the period of the attack, watching; in other words, looking at the fighting between the two adversaries. Right. I think I have faithfully reproduced what you said. And can you confirm that you did make such a statement to the investigators in the first instance?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">

            <p>-- you say that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi distributed machetes and that he himself threw a grenade. So these are two pieces of information which do not appear in your first statement. The question was -- please wait for my question.The question is: why did you wait for a whole month and the return of the investigators to say that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi himself threw a grenade and distributed machetes?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, may I come in again, because in the statement of April the witness says quite clearly that after Mr. Ndindabahizi had disembarked from the vehicle with a grenade, he started attacking the refugees, which is the same as what is stated in the second paragraph. So it is not true that there are contradictions or discrepancies between the two statements. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>There is, however, a difference in having a grenade in one's hand and coming down from a car and throwing a grenade, and I think it would be up to the witness to tell us what the difference is.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Mr. Witness, that is the question. The question is: why did you in one statement say the following: "He disembarked from the truck" -- that is Mr. Ndindabahizi -- "with a grenade in his hand", whereas in the second statement you say, "I saw Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, holding a grenade and then throwing it towards you". Why is there two different formulations there? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>It's not a contradiction. He waited for the occupants of the green vehicle to approach him so that he can have a meeting, a small meeting with them, before moving into action.</p>

            <p>Another question on your statement of the 26th April 2001. In that statement, at the end of that statement, let's say four paragraphs before the end, you state: "Both at Gitwa and Muhira, Tutsi women were raped and subsequently killed, apart from the woman that you heard yesterday, all the women -- apart from the one you interviewed yesterday". How did you know that a woman had already been interviewed by the investigators?Do you want me to repeat the question for you, Mr. Witness? You spoke to the investigators about a woman who had already testified to them on the eve of the day when you yourself were interviewed by the investigators.

            <p>With regard to the women on Muhira and rapes, women were raped when we were fleeing. Furthermore, others were speared at, immediately they were raped. Others were crucified. The person called Jean, the agronomist, his one ear was cut off, and another man was killed and decapitated. At that time it was one Kayishema who was our prefét, and people would come and he would be shown the people whose heads had been cut off, and the people who had committed those crimes were rewarded.

            <p>From 1985 I did not see him again, but I used to see him in 1984, and I saw him after the death of Habyarimana when he came to Bisesero. I could not have been -- I would not have been able to recognise him because of his age, but Jean said, "Do you see that even Ndindabahizi has come from Kigali to kill the Tutsi?" And this Jean was the agronomist of the prefecture, so they used to meet in Kigali, but I never went to Kigali; I was a very ordinary citizen, and I stayed with my family. That is why Jean said, "There he is. There are no Tutsis to be killed in Kigali, now he's coming to kill people of his native region". And he asked us to flee, and the attackers ran after us with grenades, and they were firing at us.Why should I lie about him? I have no -- I have nothing against him.</p>

            <p>Witness, you said a while ago that in 1984 -- 1994, in Gitwa, you would not have been able to recognise Ndindabahizi, but it is Jean, the agronomist, who told us -- who told you that "Ndindabahizi is here". Was it Jean who announced the presence of Ndindabahizi at Gitwa Hill?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>No. I knew him much earlier. I knew him, but Jean was talking to those who did not know him, but I was present there and I knew him. Jean was talking to those people who did not know him, and you see, even here I can recognise him. From where I'm sitting, I can recognise him. And besides, since the end of the war, I have not seen him. But I haven't asked anybody to point out Ndindabahizi to me, for me to be able to identify him. I am here, and he is on the other side. Why are you -- do you want me to -- do you want me to give a false testimony? I'm saying I was present and I saw what happened. </p>

            <p>Very well. Let's move on to events of 1994. In your written statement you stated that you remained in your native cellule, but that you moved a bit to the hinterland of the country for reasons of security, particularly to Gitarama and Massango.

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>I told you that this is just an estimate, because the Hutus started chasing us out of our houses soon after the death of Habyarimana, and people were fleeing and leaving behind them their cattle without taking anything with them. So I am unable to tell you, because here you are fleeing with your children, you have abandoned your cattle; you will not have the courage to keep track of dates. And in that kind of situation you have children who are crying and you have nothing to give them. It is difficult to keep track of dates. It is really difficult to recall dates. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>Around those dates, around those dates, because some time elapsed after the death of Habyarimana. And besides, before we fled to Gitwa, before the Interahamwe attacked us, the Hutu people chased us, took our goats, and we left with our cattle. Later on we had to leave our cattle and take refuge on the Gitwa Hill without taking our cattle with us, because our cattle had been taken by the people. The Interahamwe came later on, and we had assembled on the Gitwa Hill. Besides, they came to Gitwa after we had spent three days there on that hill.</p>

But during the morning attack, there were no soldiers. The soldiers came in, in the afternoon, together with the Accused and two vehicles. The Interahamwe went back at 11 a.m., and another attack took place in the afternoon, and that attack was led by the Accused.

            <p>The attackers regrouped, got close to Ndindabahizi and his driver. They stood there for a while, and the vehicle was further on. They first of all got close to Ndindabahizi, and next to him there were people. Then the Interahamwes ran quickly and threw grenades at us. This man also threw grenades at us. He also had two grenades attached to his belt and one in his hand. At the time they were throwing the grenades at us, we were able to escape. At least in that first phase, there were soldiers who were shooting at us. At the top of the hill there was a big gun that had been fixed -- that had been positioned at the top of the hill, and there were people who were falling on the opposite hill, and there was a distance between the two hills. Others were chasing the victims. Regarding the big gun which was positioned at the top of the hill, we couldn't even see it.So, in the evening, as I said earlier on, the killings abated, and so I have nothing more to add to this attack that was mounted by this man.

            <p>These refugees were on the hill. At the foot of this hill there was a road. We were at the top of the hill. Some were closer to the road, and when you take that road, it takes you towards the Karongi antenna, and the road continues towards Gisovu. So it was close to the road that goes to Gisovu. I'm talking about the Gisovu commune.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>Let me start with the steps on the side. But since we were on the hill, it was uphill, so we were uphill from them and they were downhill, so our position was relatively uphill in relation to them and their position was closer to the road. We were therefore at the top of the hill and they were at the foot of the hill, close to the road.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well, Witness. But regarding the distance, are you able to assist us any better? Are you able to give the distance approximately in metres?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>I have never been an agronomist to indulge in exercises of measurement. I can tell you that the person I saw was that far or that far, so I've never been engaged in exercises of measurement. I am an ordinary person, so how do you want me to measure in metres? Maybe you should better put that question to somebody who is an agronomist.When I see somebody at a distance, I can see him, but I would not attempt to give you the distance in terms of metres. </p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>We understand that. It is difficult to estimate in metres; we all understand that. But if you could just try to explain to us by using this courtroom as the measurement, approximately the distance between you and Mr. Ndindabahizi. So, if you were sitting there where you are sitting now, can you point to anything in the courtroom and say, "I was here where I am sitting now, approximately, and he was, say, at a distance equivalent to where this or that is"? Can you do that again to us, please, so that we have an idea? It is important to know for the Court, you know, approximate. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>I don't think one can make a comparison between a level -- a place which is level, and a slope. When you are uphill and there is one person, the other person is downhill, they are not at the same level, so it is difficult to transpose that to a level place, a level ground.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>We also understand that. We know this. So, you are not able to say whether the distance was less than this courtroom, was it, or more than this courtroom, the length of this courtroom, bearing in mind that you were not at the same level, but that there was a slope?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I could. The position was not level in relation to where the Accused was. </p>

            <p>Well, if we were on the field I could have given you an estimate. I cannot find a place here that I can compare to the place in question. If I were taken to an area with a similar topography to the one on the hill, I would be able to give you an estimate, but given this level ground, I am unable to give you an estimate.</p>

            <p>So we do not know the distance between you and the Accused, but at least we know that you were uphill in relation to him. My question then is as follows: when the Accused threw his grenade, he threw it -- he threw it from his position downhill to your position uphill?</p>

            <p>Are you talking about climbing up? There were many, and there were many dead bodies. There were many. There were many attackers, they chased the refugees, and they ran over a distance of one kilometre, and then there were a lot of dead bodies in the place. If you cannot run, somebody will shoot you, and when grenades are thrown, it explodes and hits a lot of people. It is not an attack using bladed weapons, they were using projectiles. When guns are shot, it is over a long distance, so how can you escape from bullets being shot from sub-machine guns? I saw a sub-machine gun at Mugina, it was positioned on a hill, and they were shooting at people who were at a very long distance. </p>

            <p>Witness, I am not talking to you about sub-machine guns, I am talking about the actions of Ndindabahizi. Let's take the sequence of events. You see two vehicles arrive on the road; the occupants of the vehicle, the passengers in the vehicle get down; people assemble around Ndindabahizi, and then they take weapons; and at that stage they start attacking you. That is my understanding; is that correct?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>Not several minutes. They immediately started running after us. They were running after us, killing. Some people were falling. You know, people don't run at the same distance <stage>(sic),</stage> some people got killed in the process. Elderly women, children, cannot run as fast as young men. So, the speed of young men is not the same as elderly persons, and the attackers were generally young men, and women and children were victims, because they could not run as fast as the attackers; we were able to run away from the attackers.</p>

            <p>Witness, let us concentrate on the duration. You said there was a minute between when the vehicles came to a stop and when the attack started. I now want to know at what time did the refugees on the Muyira Hill try to escape from the attackers? Did they wait to be attacked with the grenades or they started -- they started moving back as soon as the soldiers arrived?</p>

            <p>I would like to know if the refugees on the Gitwa Hill tried to run away as soon as they saw the Interahamwe or they stood there and waited for the Interahamwe to start the attack before running.</p>

            <p>When they got down from their vehicles, they stopped for a while. Not too many minutes elapsed before the grenades were thrown, and at the time they were thrown on those people who were close to the electric pylon which was there, people run. Those who were able, were able to escape, others were hit with bullets. So people spread around on the hill in all directions. People were running; they were shooting at them. So this is a description of the situation. These people were chasing us and killing.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, but I want to talk about the sequence before the shooting, because later on you said you left immediately. So what I am interested in is what you saw in relation to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. So let me reformulate my question: the refugees who were on the hill, the Gitwa Hill, did they get close to see -- did they get close to the vehicle to see what was happening or did they stand there, or on the contrary, was there movement of the crowd and flight, because the refugees understood they were coming to attack them, and fled immediately? That is my question.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgv">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGV:</speaker>
            <p>I'll answer that question for you. When the vehicles arrived, in the first instance there was the white car belonging to Ndindabahizi, and the driver parked the vehicle. The second vehicle did the same, and when they came down, when they disembarked from the vehicle, they took the weapons and they came close to Ndindabahizi and his driver, and after a few minutes they ran after us, and in our turn we also ran, and as we ran, they were killing us. So that is the description of that incident. If you still haven't understood, I don't think you will be asking me the same questions on the same subject.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. But one last question, nonetheless. So you were on the hill at a certain distance from the Accused, other people were around the Accused; you yourself were on a hill where there were many refugees, so how can you be sure that you recognised Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, whereas you had only seen him, rare -- rarely previously, and more than ten years from that time, and you also claimed that you saw this incident for one small, short minute?</p>

I never tried to remain in one place, as myself, like the other young men, we ran, and people were shooting at us. There were no bushes; grenades were being thrown at us, and bullets were being shot. Some people were hit, and they fell, and we ran, because there were no bushes in which we could have hidden, and since it was in the open there were many deaths. Many people were killed.

            <p>We would -- Mr. Witness, we would seek a little clarification. In your statement you said that Mr. Ndindabahizi was known to you well before the war, being a manager of a Trafipro store where you went to make purchases. In reply to your question, put by the learned Defence counsel, you said when you used to visit the store in connection with the purchases, "The Accused was in his office." How could you see him, whether he would come out of his office to see you, or whether you would go and meet him in his office? </p>

            <p>I didn't have to go and see him. I didn't have any reason for so doing. I went to that location in order to purchase several items. His office was next door; sometimes he was in there. But since his office was close to the place where the sales were done, I could see him. As for his -- as for the clothing, I would buy material or fabrics from which I had children's clothes made; sometimes I would wait throughout the day while waiting for their clothes to be made. You know, when you stay in a -- you stay for a day in a place, in a particular place, you can't fail to see the people who work there. Those are the conditions under which I got to know that man. There was a tailor who was there, and when I would -- I would spend some time with the tailor. You wouldn't be unable not to know the people who work in at that place.

            <p>Mr. President, here I would like to refer to Article 6 of the European Convention. Since the beginning, the identification of the witness is unfair, given the fact that in the courtroom coloured people are either in legal robe or in uniform. Only the Accused person is in civilian uniform, and this is a violation, a fundamental violation of the European Convention in relation to what we will refer to as a fair trial. </p>

            <p>Mr. President, Your Honours, it's Mr. Marçais who will conduct the cross-examination, but I would like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that we are moving away from the indictment. Nowhere is Mr. Ndindabahizi accused of having made a speech or having gone to the Mabanza commune. I don't know where the Prosecution is going with this testimony, but I thought it was necessary to draw the Court's attention to this, that this testimony does not correspond to any paragraph of the indictment.

            <p>This is really, really below the belt. This is so objectionable. It is untrue. My learned friend has deliberately laid an ambush for the witness, and it turns out that there is no relationship between this name and this witness, and he knows it. He knows it, too. There's absolutely no relationship whatsoever between the name here and this witness. Every other name mentioned here has a first name. Now, a first name is mentioned here that bears no relationship with this witness, and I ask that the Defence be sanctioned and disciplined. It is absolutely unprofessional behaviour to lay an ambush in such a manner, and we'll be looking to enter this as a Chamber exhibit, Your Honour.</p>

            <p>You see, it's quite likely that I do not recall that date. It was a long time ago. Moreover, given the circumstances of the time, we were not even thinking that we would have to report on these incidents; therefore, I don't remember the date very well.</p>

            <p>Am I correct in saying that you found people who were not in uniform, not armed, at a marketplace, and you say from the outset that -- and also it's a commune where you are not native, and you immediately jump to the conclusion that they are Interahamwe?</p>

            <p>But, you see, there were other people at the meeting place and they did not take the machetes. So why were these persons taking the machetes, whereas others who were also there did not take the machetes?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>So you would define an Interahamwe by the fact that such a person takes up a machete?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>No. I myself can take a machetes, someone else can take a machete without it being necessary that we be Interahamwe, but these people were Interahamwe. They carried out murderous expeditions and they had passed by where I was. I have told that you that was not my native region and people did not know me, and I could see everything that was happening, and I could see the actors, the perpetrators, and I was seeing them with my own eyes.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Grateful, Your Honour. Your Honour, I make a very quick application under the provisions of Rule 46 of Rules of Procedure and Evidence of this Tribunal. The basis for my application is that counsel for the Defence's conduct in this courtroom this evening warrants a warning under that rule, and that the trial Chamber is at liberty to consider sanctions as may deem appropriate. The factual basis for my motion under Rule 46 is as follows: that today, the 16th of September 2003, during the cross-examination of Witness CGL, a witness called by the Prosecution, counsel for the Defence put improper questions to that witness in cross-examination. We submit, respectfully, to Your Honours that the questions put to Witness CGL were not put to her in good faith, and more importantly, they were not made in the legitimate -- with the legitimate objective of impeaching Witness CGL's credibility. Rather, we submit to Your Honours that those questions, those improper questions, were posed to slander that witness, to destroy her reputation before this Trial Chamber and, more seriously, to mislead Your Honours into believing that that witness had made false representations before this Chamber. We say that the representations were not made in good faith because counsel for the Defence had witness statements before them. In that regard, I refer Your Honours to paragraph 1 of page 176 of your witness bundle. You would find there a witness statement dated the 27th of February 2001 in English, and if you are looking at your French bundle it would be paragraph 1 at page 180 of the French version. It clearly states the witness's name. I further refer Your Honours to paragraph 8 on page 177 of the English bundle, and paragraph 8 of page 181 of the French bundle, which refers to the particulars of her parents. My learned friend for the Defence had a document in his hand which clearly indicated not only the witness's name but, indeed, that of either of her parents. We there say -- we therefore say that having been faced with such material, it was improper and a deliberate attempt to mislead the Trial Chamber to represent falsely to both the witness, Your Honours, and, indeed, the Prosecution, that the witness had indeed made a false representation. We ask Your Honours to consider the sanctions available under Rule 46A, B and C of the Rules of Procedure of this honourable Court. Those are my submissions, Your Honour.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">

            <p>Thank you very much. Defence, please.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Mr. President. Very respectfully, we do not believe that Mr. Marçais had conduct which was offensive or harmful to warrant a warning pursuant to Rule 46A. Therefore, we are relying on this rule, but no warning has been given to Mr. Marçais; however, we are in a trial which is very special, Mr. President, Your Honours, one in which we need to determine on a daily basis and on an early basis, the evidence. And we also -- it is up to us to determine the credibility of the witness. That is our duty. Sometimes we do this rather hurriedly. And it is true that we have obtained this morning a ruling on this matter, but what is the harm done? The witness had the opportunity to express herself and verify and to tell us that the name was -- her name was not the one on the statement in question. It is also a possibility that the Prosecution does make mistakes from time to time and the document -- and sometimes they say that the witnesses they have not arrived. Mr. Marçais was trying legitimately to carry out he is duty in relation to this witness and he did not have the intent to be offensive or misleading and he did not wish to mislead the Tribunal either. And I, therefore, on that basis, wish to you to dismiss the application made by the Prosecutor because it has no basis whatsoever. I thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours. </p>

            <p>The answer is no, Mr. President.

            <p>Further misrepresentations as these proceedings go on. Counsel for the Defence who cross-examined Witness CGL obtained that document from his assistant, a Kinyarwanda-speaking gentleman, who sits right in this courtroom. It is an absolute misrepresentation of the facts on the record for him to suggest, again, before the Trial Chamber, that he was not aware of the content of that statement.

After the conversation, they went to where Karara was, they started bringing people together, gathering people together.

I am just coming from Kigali where there is no Tutsi alive, and I don't know what you are doing because we don't want any Tutsi alive".

But as for Mukantabana, she was first of all taken to her home by the attackers because they wanted to see where she had allegedly hid money so that the assailants could take it. The assailants took her body to go and throw it into a pit because there was a matter of counting the dead. I believe Karegeya was killed at the roadblock that we have been speaking about. </p>

            <p>Well, they asked me to come and, knowing that he was my former employer, I thought he was going to give me another job. And I got the impression -- I thought it was an interview to enable me to get a job.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. He asked me to tell him if the Accused came to my region, if he killed and if I knew him. Now, after that conversation, he told me that I had been selected as a witness. And I asked him by whom, and he said, "You have been selected as a witness to go to Arusha and you'll be very well rewarded", and they were telling me a lot of fantastic things. But I told them that I don't even know that place and I don't want to go. That was the answer I gave them.</p>

            <p>I'm saying that because he came and asked me to explain to him if I had seen Ndindabahizi come to my region, if I had seen him killing, and if I knew him. He, therefore, wanted me to give him explanations on these three points.

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, the Defence finds it intolerable that, once again, it's been suggested that Defence teams have exerted pressure on a witness to withdraw his testimony. This is obviously something which is not in favour of the Defence. For three weeks now it has been, more or less directly suggested that members of the Defence team have themselves intervened or have sent somebody. One time it' **************************; another time it's a short man, and this is in order to exert pressure on witnesses. So, the Prosecutor has just said that it should be noted that it is not the Prosecutor which has sent anyone to the witness, and I wish you to grant me the same, that we have not sent anyone to exert any kind of pressure on the witnesses. We work with ethics and during this trial we have shown that ****************************** was the brother of one of the Prosecution witnesses, and we also believe that some Prosecution witnesses know one another, and we do assert that if there have been any leakages around the identities of the Prosecution witnesses, it is not on the Defence that this should be blamed. And I think I would like on that note to thank you for your attention.</p>

            <p>Right. My question was: Why did you leave Nyakagenzi, where you seemed to be in security, for you to walk that long distance to Kagabiro, whereas you already knew that Kagabiro area around Gasharu was not really very safe for Tutsis?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Now, this is my question: Why did you leave this relatively safe area of Nyakagenzi river in order to go to the danger that that would place you in and the roadblocks that you would have to pass through to go and seek refuge at Gahigiro?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>Normally, I did not take the road on which roadblocks had been erected. At certain times, from 11 p.m. until 4:00 in the morning, one could walk, and you would stop wherever you got to at 4 a.m. so that you could hide. That is how I was hiding in order to try and survive. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. And you state that as you were walking you did your best to avoid roadblocks which you may have come across; is that not so?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Why -- after having left your Hutu friend who provided you with shelter, why did you go and seek refuge only 20 metres away from a roadblock?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>I hid in that area because, as I have just said, it was 4 a.m. You needed to stop wherever you were so that you are not seen, whether it's a place where there was grass or whether it was close by Interahamwe. You needed to hide. Furthermore, one could even hide close to an Interahamwe's house because he wouldn't think that you were hiding there. It was highly improbable that the Interahamwe would find such people around his own house. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. But you said, however, that you had taken care to avoid the other roadblocks. Was this roadblock in particular less fearful for you -- or less dangerous for you?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>I was saying that at the distance of 20 metres away from a roadblock, if you are hiding there, no one from there would think of coming to look for you around there because those people didn't believe that anyone could come and hide so close to a roadblock.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Between Nyakagenzi and Gahigiro, how many roadblocks did you see, if any?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>Normally, when someone is not afraid and it's during the day, that distance can be covered in about 40 minutes, but since it was at night and I was walking slowly so that I do not raise anyone's suspicion, that is why it took me a whole hour to cover that distance.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. So, you remained hidden in the Hutu's house for three weeks, you stated; is that correct?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Therefore, it was not certainly at the beginning of the month of May that you saw at the Gitaka roadblock the events that you spoke of and which involve Emmanuel Ndindabahizi; is that so?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>It was at the end of May.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>However, in your written statement you're very categorical and you state -- this is in the last paragraph of the first page of your written statement, you say that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the beginning of May, in early May. How could you be so sure? Let me repeat my question. Let me repeat my question: How could you have been so sure in November 2000 and, also, how can you be so sure today by saying that you -- that this incident took place almost a month later?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>I've explained that. I have stated that I took as my point of reference the day when I arrived on Idjwi Island on the 4th of June, and the last time that I had seen him, a week had passed in relation to the time when I reached Idjwi Island at the beginning of June.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Should I understand that you thought about this since you signed your written statement and that recently you came to the conclusion that you must have seen him, taking all into account, at the end of May 1994?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, you asked me a question concerning the distance between Nyakagenzi and Kagabiro. I told you that it was an hour's walk, approximately. So, you understand I went into retrospect and I took as my point of reference the 4th of June, the day on which I reached Idjwi Island, and I tried to estimate the time I saw him last and I realised that about a week had elapsed, the day he had said that he didn't want to speak -- to hear mention made of any Tutsis. So, I was trying to find out how much time I had been remaining in hiding and I realised that that must have been the duration. This was a person of authority who had spoken by saying that this is over; someone who is trying to save the life of a Tutsi will have to leave together with that Tutsi.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Now, six years after, you remember a date which you say was about the beginning of May 1994, but after some reflection of some month you say that you remember that it was indeed the end of May 1994. Have you decided on that finally? Was it the end of May 1994 or was it the beginning of May 1994? Can you please be more specific about that today?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>As for dates, I am telling you that it is not very easy to remember exact dates, especially when you are hiding. But the only date that I can recall is the date on which I arrived on Idjwi Island. It was during the day. Even an animal in the bush, when it comes out of the bush, it is afraid; it is frightened because it is used to moving about at night. So I'm telling you I thought about it and I realised that I reached Idjwi on the 4th of June, the beginning of June. Now, I stayed at that place for one week, the place where those words had been said. So, it's after a week that I reached Idjwi Island, and those words were saying that it was the end for the Tutsis. He no longer wanted to hear mention made of Tutsis. That's what he said. So that's what I used as my point of reference in order to try and remember the date.</p>

            <p>One last question on this, Mr. Witness. Did you, as you said, think of it or did somebody asked you to change this date from the beginning of May to the end of May 1994?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>Well, if there is anyone who reminded me of that date, he would have given me the exact date. I'm saying that I tried to recollect the date on which I got to Idjwi, and I said it was on the 4th of June, that is what they told me anyhow when I got there. That is what led me to go over the chronology of events. I remained in Rwanda for one week. Now, when you take it from there, I conclude that the last time I saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was toward the end of May. At the time he made the statement that I referred to. </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Witness, let's focus a bit on the kitchen in which you sought refuge at the Gasharu centre. At what time did you realise that there was a roadblock close to that kitchen; was it before you went into the kitchen or after?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>I already knew the position of that roadblock. But at 4 a.m., I decided to stop because at that stage I needed to look for a hiding place, somewhere I could hide. You could be -- you could be found, but it was not proper to be seen by others or to expose yourself to other people.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

            <p>The window was already closed, but the door was not closed. If I had closed it, people would start wondering. Normally when a door is left ajar no one can suspect the presence of a person in that room if the door is left open.</p>

            <p>Maybe with the assistance of the registry we can give the witness photos of the Gitaka centre, which is in Exhibit P2 and maybe the witness will be able to recognise the kitchen in which he was hiding. Exhibit P2, there are documents L0019894, and L0019895, which show the Gitaka centre. Maybe the registrar can show the photographs to the witness, and let the witness tell us if he is able to recognise the kitchen. If the witness is able to recognise the kitchen, then he should point it out on the overhead projector. Otherwise it would not be useful. The L- number is L0019884.</p>

            <p>I'm not able to identify the road as well as the Gitaka centre. In any case, the roadblock is located between Karara and Ndabukiye's house.

            <p>Well, that was being done at night. We took -- we were in the habit of eating only at night, around 23 hours, and it was only on those occasions that we could eat; that is, obviously, if we are able to find food in the first place.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, the question is why did you tell the investigators of the Tribunal in November 2000 that you witnessed the killing of Mukantabana from a distance of 20 metres, whereas in this court you said that you were not witnessed -- witness to that event?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>This is not a contradiction because I saw her body when she was brought back; I personally saw her body brought by the same people who -- who led the deceased person to her house before bringing her body back.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well, Witness, that is your answer. Another -- in another answer you said that you left your Hutu friend who was hiding you and that you found a hiding place in this kitchen by chance; is that -- was that your testimony?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>I have already clarified that issue.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>In other words, your friend did not know where you were going to hide when you left his house?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>When you leave a person's house to go to another place, that person will find out -- would like to know where you went. And you yourself would give some information. And it is a manner of proceeding to find traces of the person you are looking for if he is, indeed, a friend. That is how this person was able to trace me and find me where I was hiding in order to give me food.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgl">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGL:</speaker>
            <p>I have told you this. There is a manner or there is a way of proceeding. You may -- you may signal to someone who is looking for you by putting on a torch light or making a -- showing a sign. People were moving around, around 23 hours and that is when we ourselves could come out of our hiding. And we -- we will move around until 4 a.m. because the roadblocks were not operational during that period between 23 hours and 4 a.m.</p>

            <p>Objection, Mr. President. It is even worse than what he wanted to do earlier. We have certain rules to follow here. We must hear witnesses and we cannot be satisfied merely with their written statements. In the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, there are rules to be followed. If the Prosecutor needs to have a written statement of a witness without hearing that witness, that statement must be authenticated, and he must also respect certain legal aspects. And we, therefore, believe the Chamber should dismiss this request being made by the Prosecutor because he cannot have as an exhibit a document from a witness who has not yet been heard.</p>

            <p>Yes, Your Honour, I have an application to make. I note Your Honours decision following my learned colleague's application pursuant to Rule 85. I seek to renew that application pursuant to Rule 89 <stage>(C)</stage> of the rules of procedure of this Tribunal, in that the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which has probative value. I also renew that application under the provisions of 92bis, 92bis <stage>(A)</stage> and 92bis <stage>(B)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure of this Tribunal, and that Rule states as follows: "Proof of facts other than those admitted by oral evidence". Why is 92bis relevant in the incident case? The facts are as follows: The witness that appears before you today, and I forget his pseudonym, CGB testified on a fact that is not contained in his witness statement. However, that fact is contained in the witness statement of Witness CGD, CGD, Charlie, Golf, Delta. Now, what is the relationship between Witness CGD and this witness? Well, the relationship is as follows: In Prosecution Exhibit P20, Witness CGB states that he sought refuge at the residence of a certain man named in Prosecution Exhibit P20. Now, it so happens that that person is Witness CGD's father. Therefore, following the provisions of Rule 92bis, such a matter is prime facie admissible in evidence by virtue of the provisions of Rules92bis <stage>(A)</stage>
              <stage>(1).</stage> It says: "Factors in favour of admitting evidence in the form of a written statement include, and is not limited to circumstances in which the evidence in question is of a cumulative nature; in that other witnesses will give, or have given oral testimony of similar facts." Now, what is a similar fact here? The similar fact is the witness that just got off of the stand -- namely, Charlie, Golf, Bravo -- states under oath, before Your Honours, that he sought refuge over a period of three weeks at the residence of CGD's father. He then enters CDG's father's name as a Prosecution exhibit. Now, CGD's statement confirms that statement. And we seek to renew our application under that Rule 92bis. Failing that, I renew that application under Rule 89 <stage>(C),</stage> just on the basis that it has probative value of the fact that this witness sought refuge for a three-week period at the residence of CGD. Your Honour, I'm grateful.</p>

            <p>Yes, Mr. President, three brief observations. The first is that I come from a question -- a country where the rulings made by a Bench is not questioned by any of the parties. My second question is that your ruling dismissing the proposal by my learned friend is based on the fact that he did not during his examination-in-chief mention that issue. So, there was no problem with that. My third observation is that we do not find ourselves in the situation of Rule 92bis; but the Prosecution intends to tender as an exhibit the witness statement of a person who is not going to be testifying before the Court. And it will have the obligation to authenticate the document, some kind of witness, and on which witness statement the Defence will not be able to put any questions.As for Rule 92bis, you will note that when one wishes to tender an exhibit in the form of a written statement, a certain number of forms or standards have to be respected, and these have not appeared. And, therefore, I do strongly oppose this application made by the Prosecution. Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.</p>

I will be working with her once I leave here, and I propose to call her tomorrow afternoon. Thereafter, depending on Your Honours' ruling, I reserve my right to now call Witness CGD, but that is a separate matter. We have -- as planned, we expect Witness Charlie, Golf, Charlie, No. 11 on Your Honours' list. And I think we also expect Witness Charlie, Golf, Papa, No. 14 on Your Honours' list; and depending on Your Honours' ruling, Charlie, Golf, Delta. None of those witnesses are in Arusha as we speak. None of them would arrive before Friday of this week. So once Madam Des Forges has left the stand, I regret that we have no further witnesses to offer the Chamber for the rest of this week. Hopefully, they will come in on Friday. Hopefully, they can take the stand on Monday and Tuesday of next week. And that being the case, we should be in a position to close our case on Tuesday of next week, but it depends on the availability of these witnesses, Your Honour.</p>

            <p>Yes, it all depends on what the Prosecutor needs to do. I understood it to be said that the Prosecution was not going to go too much in depth in Ms. Des Forges' report, in which case we won't have any problem. If the Prosecution intends to ask questions of the witness of each item of her report, I think we would need more time so I can discuss with my client and my team. I'm asking, once again, whether the Prosecution is going to go into an in-depth examination of Mrs. Alison Des Forges or not?</p>

            <p>It is -- it is very difficult at this stage to tell him what an in depth examination of Madam Des Forges's report would consist of. If my learned friend is suggesting that I am going to have her go through the entire report, then that's not my intention, but rather, my intention is to dialogue with her or at least adduce her testimony in relation to certain aspects of that report, very issues of a general nature. She might -- she may often need to refer to certain paragraphs in her report and other documents as well, that are not in this document, but have been disclosed to the Defence.</p>

            <p>But are you in a position to indicate some of the areas now? Because my problem is this: If suddenly there is a delay with the translation, then -- and since we have no other witnesses for this week, and if she is around, then we could hear military, entirely tomorrow, and hear Alison Des Forges on Wednesday, and then we will give more time to the Defence to read the report with the French version and -- but there is a need to know. </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>The honest answer to Your Honour's enquiry is this: When I had indicated Tuesday afternoon for Madam Des Forges's testimony, I had done so on the basis that I had been assured that my learned friend for the Defence would have that report in his hands this morning. I regret that has not been the case, and it has crossed my mind that in view of the fact that he wouldn't have a chance to read it until after he leaves here, it may well be the case that we want to take Alison on -- Madam Des Forges, rather, on Wednesday as oppose to Tuesday. That's fine by me. I'm willing to do that. </p>

            <p>Yes, Mr. President. Even in English I can read the document. I know specifically the points on which I expect to put questions to Ms. Des Forges; I know about that. Those are elements on which she insisted -- or she mentions Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, and they are very few. My learned friend has mentioned documents which were attached to that report, and I have not received any disclosure of such documents. I don't want us to be surprised at the last minute with documents containing materials on Mr. Ndindabahizi, and I wouldn't be able to have gone through them. I think from Ms. Des Forges's report, we need to identify matters on which I could ask questions of Ms. Des Forges, otherwise the other matters are really of no interest to me. </p>

            <p>The -- yes, the -- Madam Des Forges will refer to, and she has done so in her report anyway at the last page of the 26th. She will be referring to the transcripts of the May 3rd meeting, which is a document that has been in circulation for a long time, has been disclosed to --</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So that is the document you are referring to? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>That is the main document that I referred to, transcripts of the May 3rd, meeting. He is indicating that in the negative, I'm quite surprised about that, but again, that's the document that we can make available to my learned friend.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Unless I am mistaken, I have not received disclosure of this document. It would seem that this is an extremely important document because it's the only aspect from Ms. Des Forges's report which concerns Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi personally.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>If my learned friend has not received it from me in this case, he will certainly have come across it in the Kayishema and the Ruzindana trial. It was used in conjunction with that case. As far as it mentions his client, there is a tiny little paragraph of a speech that Mr. Ndindabahizi alleged to have given at the same meeting, which we can have available to him. As far as I'm concerned, I thought I had given it to him. If I haven't, I would make it available to him, but again, it's a public document and it's a document that has been referred to over and over again.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So, then Mr. Phillips, you will make available the 3rd of May speech, and not -- there will be no need for you, Mr. Besnier, to go the way through the Kayishema, even if that is a public document. So then we know which document is coming up. Any other document coming up in connection with the report of this witness? </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>There is -- there is one -- the one or two interviews of the Accused himself to the Office of the Prosecutor, which I have disclosed to my learned friend in English and in French. She may or may not be referring to it. It's just a minor part of it that she wants to talk about, but then again we've disclosed that. That I did personally, so I know that.</p>

            <p>Yes. All right. So then we decide that we drop this -- we will then adjourn until Wednesday at 2 o'clock for the testimony of Alison Des Forges. Now, I know you are as unhappy as the Bench is, with the frequency of witnesses in this trial, Mr. Phillips. And now I am making -- giving instructions to the registry. Registry, by the end of this case, the Chamber wants a written report why it was not possible to ensure the steady flow of Prosecution witnesses, but how we are deprived of witnesses after three days; four days; two days, during these weeks in the courtroom? So please, provide us with an explanation, and we want that in writing at the end of the Prosecution case.</p>

            <p>Your Honours, it's in relation to Witness No. 14 on your list with the pseudonym "Charlie Golf Papa". Your Honour would recall that I had indicated to Your Honours that this witness was brought to Arusha last week. I haven't met with him. We then realised that even though he was the person, he was indicated to be as is named on -- in that paragraph. He was not the person that we intended to speak with. We then made enquiries and the feedback we got as of last Friday is that somehow along the line, the names of this witness has been mixed up with another witness. So the practical situation is this and it's a very unsafe reward: It's the statement of a certain man, but the witness statement bears all the correct details and all the correct information apart from the name. The name is that of someone else. And the only reason why we've been able to ascertain this is that we contacted the next of kin on the statement. And through the next of kin, who is a local authority in the commune mentioned on that statement, we were able to decipher that rather than the witness being known by the name indicated there, that witness had been responsible for contacting the person with that name, and somewhere along the line the investigators, after this witness's testimony, had put his name - sorry, the name you see on 14, against the statement of his man. I have asked for a written explanation as to how this witness -- this mixed up has occurred, and I am only alerting the Court and my learned friend for the Defence, I would present my learned friend for the Defence with the real name -- and not the real name, but the name that has arisen as the owner of the statement. It's a very unusual situation.</p>

            <p>Your Honour, it isn't. It's the correct particulars, but it's not the correct name. We have another statement from another witness with exactly the same name taken round about the same time. And I think in cutting and pasting, our investigators somehow have mixed the names up. And whilst the particulars are correct, the statement does not belong to the person named on that -- on paragraph 1 of page 142; it belongs to somebody else.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>It's the wrong name. The maker of the statement exists; all the personal details on the witness statement are correct. They belong to someone who has able to confirm that they belonged to him, but for some reason, it's not his name on the statement.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>I'm not satisfied, Mr. President. I'm not all satisfied with the explanations given by the Prosecution. Since the beginning of this trial, since October 2001, we have received a certain number of documents, most of which were disclosed -- were given to the Judge who confirmed the indictment. Now, as for Witness CGP, we did -- we did indeed receive two statements of that witness. And now we were being told that, "No, there are two different people involved, and one usurp the name of the other". I'm rather disturbed about the authenticity of this testimony, and I am against all this in the interest of my client. If the Prosecutor were to be allowed to call this witness, the Defence will question him or her seriously, and in depth, in order to find out how he was brought to testify. And at this present moment, I would just merely say that, we, at the Defence, are very, very disquiet -- disquieted by the situation.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Did you mention that there were two statements of this witness, Mr. Besnier.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Mr. President. In the list which was disclosed in October 2001, that list indeed contains the mention of the witness, CGP. He was then No. 13 in the first list issued in October 2001, and that witness was interviewed twice on the 4th of April 2001 and the 2nd of June 2001.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Because they referred to two separate people, Your Honour. My learned friend is aware that we have two witness statements from persons bearing the same name. That was the first problem we had in this -- in this case. One of them we were interested in speaking with. One was a 41 year old; one is a 38 year old. That's what we thought until last Friday, that it was coincidence we had two people bearing exactly the same name, but different dates of birth and different particulars. We opted for the -- we opted to call the 38 year old, who appears in your bundle as CDP -- CGP. However, last week they brought the 41 year old. When we showed him the statement, he said, "This is not my statement. This is not my signature". So we informed the Witness Protection Unit that, "Well, we are aware that there are two people by this, you've brought us a wrong person." So they took him back. In looking for and searching for the real CGP with this name, they couldn't find anyone with this name. So they decided to go to the next of kin, and said to him, "Well, you've been listed by a certain person as the next of kin. Do you know this person?" It then transpired that no such person existed, and the next of kin said, "The only person that you are referring so is my X and X, and he is known by this other name." We got hold of the person by that name, put this statement to him, compared the personal details at paragraph 8, name of father, name of mother, date of birth, place of birth, signature, it turns out to be our man, but with the wrong name. I am terribly embarrassed by it.</p>

The issue is this witness was short-listed for this trial on the basis of this piece of paper in your bundle. I never met him; I don't know who he is, and the basis for him being in this bundle is this piece of paper. It turns out to be someone with a different name.</p>

            <p>Not at all, Mr. President.

I'm very disquieted. If it were -- if I were in the shoes of the Prosecutor, I would not call this witness, Mr. President.</p>

So you will assess the situation, Mr. Phillips and find out how many witnesses you want to call, but I mean, the Prosecution case is actually coming to an end. Then we will meet on Wednesday at 2 o'clock then. The Court is adjourned.</p>

That's another loose document.Your Honours, would you then have another document dated 25th May l994, in English? It's entitled, "Directives of the Prime Minister to all préfets on the organisation of civil defence". We may or may not be referring to that document, but, in any event, Your Honour would have it. And then Your Honours would have the map, a colour map, which is another loose document there, yes. And we also have it on the projectors for people in the public gallery. We will be referring to that map in the course of Madam Des Forges's testimony. Going to the bound documents, Your Honours would have bound document entitled, "Interviews with Emmanuel-ndindabahizi". There are two separate interviews and the reason why we have tabbed them, 1, 2, 3, 4, is that we have English and French versions of each interview. In particular we will be referring to the last interview, which is on tab 4, and tabs 3 and 4 of that bundle. These were interviews given to the Office of the Prosecutor over a period of several years by Mr. Ndindabahizi and it's not in dispute.The final document, may look a bit lost and it's because I don't have the document, the way Your Honours have it, is, "The minutes of the May 3rd, meeting in Kibuye. And again, Your Honours, would have that -- it's a bound copy and I think the colour is white. Yes, Your Honour. And Your Honours would have that in Kinyarwanda, French and in English. Again the witness may or may not be referring to that document. And that would be it, as far as the documents are concerned, Your Honour.</p>

            <p>The Rwandan Patriotic Front launched an attack across the Rwandan frontier with approximately 7000 combatants. Many of these were descendants of Tutsi, people of Tutsi ethnicity, Rwandans of Tutsi ethnicity, who had lived abroad since the 1960s, after having fled a social and political revolution in their own country. At the time of the attack they were resident inside of Rwanda, a considerable number of Tutsi civilians, comprising then approximately nine percent of the population. The government in power was predominantly Hutu. That is to say, the members of government were of the Hutu ethnic group which was by then, of course, the great majority of the population. The President who had taken power in a military coup nearly 20 years before had been losing power, partly as a result of objective conditions over which he had no control. That is to say a serious down turn in the economic, but partly in response to growing corruption and favouritism as it was perceived by many Rwandans, that had developed considerable at that time in other parts of Africa, considerable movement to end single party states to institute multipartism, and this found echoes within Rwanda among those people who were tired of Habyarimana's Rule. When the military combat began, some surrounding President Habyarimana, and almost certainly Habyarimana himself saw this as an opportunity even more than a threat. That is an opportunity to rebuild his shrinking power base by reaching out in a new attempt to generate popular support, seeing Rwandans and particularly Hutu Rwandans against the enemy, seeing -- creating a sense of an unparalleled people against that enemy who had come from across the boarder. This was carried a step further in that the enemy became defined over time as those Tutsi civilians inside the country, and the enunciation of that idea, of that theme was clearly within two or three days of the beginning of the war, in part, because the government, on the 5th of October, following a faked attack on the capital, began a programme of massive arrests. Finally some 11,000 people, many of them were Tutsis and accused of being "accomplices" of the RPF. Subsequent to that some two weeks, later, people in the commune of Kibilira, Hutu, attacked Tutsi and killed some 300 Tutsis. So these were the first events which indicated that that military attack would then be used consciously by political authorities inside the country to depict a link, which was at that point largely a non-existent link between Tutsi civilians and the military force coming from outside the country. </p>

            <p>That was indeed the eventual result. It was over a period of years, that this idea was developed and actively propagated by certain authorities and by the press so that by the time of the great genocide of 1994, that idea was indeed very widespread.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>That is correct. The effect of the military attack was to heighten the pressure on the government, pressure which was already reeling from various donors, who were also anxious to see political reform and heightened the effect also of political descent within the country so that by June, the president was obliged to cede his exclusive political control and to permit the creation of other political parties.</p>

            <p>The party, which in numerical terms was the most important after the MRND was the MDR. The Democratic Republican Movement. A party which drew its inspirations from an earlier political party, is the PERMAHUTU, which had been important in the first republic. The Habyarimana government was a second republic. As I said, it was established as a result of a military coup and it had overthrown the first republic which was dominated by the PERMAHUTU, the PERMAHUTU had their strength largely in the centre of the country, in the préfecture known as Gitarama and in Ruhengeri. When Habyarimana took over, he shifted the geographical focus even more clearly to the northwest, and his main strength came from Gisenyi and from Ruhengeri. So the MDR essentially drew on the same kind of constituency as the MRND. That is the largely role; agricultural, population, but represented a different regional focus. The Social Democratic Party, the PSD, was a party generally supported by the intellectuals as they were called, by people in such occupations as law, not so much the businessman, but some high ranking government functionaries, people who had had the benefit of higher education, people like teachers, in some cases, medical assistants and so on. Geographically the PSD had its greatest strength in the southern part of the country, particularly the préfecture of Butare and in the capital city of Kigali. The Liberal Party was smaller in number and was very much the sort of party of free enterprise, and of the business community of business people. In part, because the first and second republic had discriminated against Tutsi. That is, had made it difficult for Tutsi to obtain higher education and positions in the administration. Many Tutsi had gone into the area of business and this helps to explain why the Liberal Party was also a party that had the proportionately greatest percentage of its membership who were also Tutsi. Eventually, another party was formed in March 1992, considerably after the others and that was the coalition for the defence of the republic, the CDR which represented the most radical form of Hutu ideas, a party which stated clearly that it was to be the representative of Hutu and that was to remain essentially separate from Tutsi.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>That was indeed a watershed in Rwandan history, because the MRND was forced to cede a realistic share of power to the MDR, to the PL and to the PSD, so that the President remained, of course, in the hands of the MRND as did a significant number of ministries. But approximately half of the ministries went into the hands of the opposition and as was also the case for the post of prime minister. So the MDR held the post of prime minister as well as certain other ministries and the PL, and the PSD, and the PDC also had a number of places at the governmental table. This had immediate repercussions all down the line because those parties that had the chance to obtain ministerial posts used them to extend their strength and influence by making changes in the administrative posts within their ministries, so that, in fact, the division of political power at the ministerial table was replicated all down the line, so that persons who had posts in the ministry as well were replaced by members who belonged -- by persons who belonged to the same political party as the minister, so that for example, in the ministry of finance, which was a ministry that fell into the hands of the PSD, important persons not everyone, of course, but important positions in that ministry would then be assigned to people who were a part of the PSD party.In the perspective, in the long term perspective of elections, this reshuffling within the administration was, of course, important because the party that had posts to deliver, that had control over resources could attract a greater number of adherence than a party that didn't have such opportunities, and this then would give them a better chance in some future elections that were being planned for.</p>

            <p>As far as we can tell from comments at the time, the vast majority of Rwandans were extraordinarily relieved to have this long and punishing war finally settled, and there was great rejoicing among many people. There were, however, several groups who did not regard the settlement as final and who were not satisfied with its terms. On the side of the government, there were particularly some military leaders, as well as some civilian political leaders, notably people from the CDR, as well as some from the MRND, who are even as the ink was drying disavowed the Arusha Accords and made it clear that they did not regard this as a final settlement. And on the side of the RPF, there were, apparently from indications we now have, other? Persons who also believed that the war was not finished and to begin to make preparations for a further battle. I do not know and I do not know of anyone who has done the work, to say, with any assurance, which, if anyone of these parties took the lead, that is, was the initiative in the hands of Rwandan government soldiers and others who were not satisfied and who began to prepare for further battle, and this then provoked further preparations on the side of the RPF. Was it the contrary or were they both -- were both sides preparing simultaneously without regard to the plans of the other. I simply do not know.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>That is correct, and the diplomats who had laboured long and hard to achieve this settlement regarded that as one of the strong points of the arrangement, because rather than being a bi-polar or two sided agreement, it was a kind of a three-legged stool, and it was anticipated that that would give greatest stability to the arrangements for the transitional period to come, a series of events which had already been on the way at the time the Accords were signed, but which speeded up throughout the rest of the year, ended up in fact dividing that three-legged stool in half, so that by end of the year, the three-legged arrangement was finished, and it was a bi-polar, a two sided political situation in Rwanda.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>The internal coalition of parties, that is the PSD, the MDR and the PL had, as we established earlier, entered into the first discussions with the RPF that led eventually to government negotiations with the RPF. But there were some within that group of parties who were not completely at ease with the alliance, with the RPF for several different reasons. And then in February of 1993, before the peace Accords were signed, the RPF violated the ceasefire by launching a major military offensive from the north down towards the city of Kigali. They were eventually persuaded to stop their events and to withdraw, and there was a new ceasefire, but in the interim, this had shattered the faith of a number of people in those three parties, the PSD, the MDR and the PL, had shattered their faith in the good intentions, in the good faith to the RPF. So there were some who began to say, "How is it possible that these people are continuing to negotiate and at the same time launched a major offensive. Doesn't that indicate perhaps their intentions are not what they would appear to be? So that was one consideration.The second was, the accords themselves gave a remarkably large share of power in the military to the RPF. The RPF obtained 40 percent of the rank and five in the army and 50 percent of the command posts. And this was seen as many -- as further proof of, should we say, an excessive appetite on the part of the RPF and an indication of danger. Then the final event which really was conclusive for many, was the assassination of the president of Burundi. The country to the south of Rwanda, a country which is demographically quite similar although its political history has been very different, but it is a country where Tutsi had held a dominant role until 1993 when Hutu won a free and fair election. A Hutu candidate won a free and fair election for president, that was Melchior Ndandaye. He was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers at the end of October 1993. This then led to an enormous barrage of propaganda within Rwanda, distorting the details of Ndandaye's death and depicting the Tutsi as a group united to either continue or </p>

          <stage>RE-Establish domination over the Hutu, and in this propaganda, the RPF of Rwanda was associated with the Tutsi of Burundi.So they were treated as a single unit. This caused further concerns and doubts among Rwandans, including many who had previously been willing to support a form of alliance with the RPF. So it was a series of events like that that contributed to this realignment in the political scene. The realignment was symbolised by the division of two political parties, that is, the MDR and the PL which divided into each one, into two wings. One wing known as the MDR and the other known as the MDR power. And in the case of the PL, PL and PL power. The term was taken from the idea of Hutu power, meaning an ethnic -- an ethnic union of great solidarity which would in fact minimise or subsume a previous party divisions among the Hutu. So it was that Hutu party -- Hutu power ideology which found expression in the division of some of these political parties.</stage>

          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Well, that speech which was broadcast on the radio was regarded as the clearest and most aggressive enunciation of the idea -- expression of the idea of Hutu power, and it said basically that, "We, as Hutu, we must unite. We are threatened by the Tutsi and, or, party distinctions should now become reduced in importance and we must remember that we Hutu are brothers and we must get to work". And one significant aspect of the speech was the use of the term, "To work", which was a term that referred back to the 1960s at the time when people attacked and in some cases killed Tutsi. So work had a very peculiar and specific special connotation and when Karemera called on people to, "work", that then was seen as incitation to violence, and as an indication that this very highly placed political official was, in fact, calling upon people to mobilise for future attacks against Tutsi.</p>

            <p>When we look back at a colourful map, Madam Witness, can you tell us, was Hutu power received throughout Rwanda or, was it limited to certain sections of that country, at the time, in 1993?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Well, the map shows areas of MRND strength, but it's somewhat misleading here because in 1994 at the start of the genocide, there were, in fact, large areas of the north of Rwanda that were no longer occupied because with the advance of the RPF, there had been a massive displacement of the population, so that if you were to have a snapshot of April 1994, you would not have the same dispersion of MRND members across the country. But in general, this gives you a sense of which areas were of MRND strength. Those areas would certainly have been identified with Hutu power. Now when it gets to MDR, its more complicated because the MDR which you see here in green are -- this map does not distinguish between MDR power and the other wing of the MDR. And while the MDR power areas would also be joined with the MRND in accepting Hutu power, those are communes -- were préfectures which, and I am thinking particularly of Gitarama, where the préfet was not of the MDR power. Those areas would have had a far more divided allegiance if any at all, to the ideas of Hutu power. And then if you move further south, into the area of the PSD, both somewhat over there in Kibuye and then Gikongoro and Butare, there Hutu power would have been at its weakest and perhaps non-existent in some areas certainly. So that in general, you could say the Hutu power ideas were well established in perhaps a half of the country, but that in the rest of the country, the ideas were known, but either not widely accepted, or accepted but not with any intention of putting them into action. So you can think of three levels. People who believed the ideas and were ready to act on them, people who perhaps believed the ideas but were not convinced of the need for action and then people who rejected the idea completely.</p>

            <p>Going on now to the events of April 6th, 1994, and the killing or, the death rather, of the president of the republic, Madam Witness, several members of the cabinet were indeed eliminated following the president's death. Do you recall why these people were eliminated and who they were?</p>

            <p>Yes. After the president's aeroplane was shot down, a group of military led by Colonel Bagosora took control of both the military and the civil situation for a brief period of time. And Colonel Bagosora attempted several times to persuade other military officers and to persuade also the International community in the form of the UN representatives, to persuade them to allow him to establish a military government. His fellow -- some of his fellow military officers did not trust Bagosora, did not want to allow him to do that and the UN representatives categorically refused and pointed out that although the president had been killed, the prime minister was still alive. And indeed we have abundant testimony from many people about the effort on the part of General Dallier, who was the UN commander at the time of the peacekeeping force and Mr. Boo-boo who was the UN Secretary General special representative, of their efforts to persuade Bagosora, to accord, Madam Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, the opportunity to establish control and to reassert the power of the government in this critical situation. It was perhaps at the very insistence that Bagosora must pay attention to Madam Uwilingiyimana that in fact sealed her death because Bagosora understood that taking over the reigns of power would not be possible so long as members of the legitimate government or any significant number of them remained available to be seen as the real leaders of power. So as soon as this became clear in the early hours of April 7th, various military groups were sent out to assassinate a number of leading members of the government, including the prime minister and various others who were representatives of political parties opposed to the MRND. And in that way, Colonel Bagosora was able, with the help of other military, to clear away the legitimate authorities and to make the argument that there was a power vacuum, and that he would then need to step into that vacuum, to take control. </p>

There was Landol Ndasingwa, who was the minister of labour and social affairs.

            <p>That is correct. Joseph Kavuruganda, the president of the constitutional court was killed, as was also Felicia Ngago of the PSD party. And the importance of the death of both Ndasingwa and Ngago is that one of those two were selected to become the president of transitional assembly and might therefore have been called upon to replace President Habyarimana. The importance of assassinating Kavurunganda was that as head of the court, he was the person -- he was the person who would have been needed to swear in a new legitimate government.</p>

            <p>The provisions of the Arusha Accords as I recall, did not provide for the succession, if the president would be killed in the transition period. So that the authorities making the decisions, instead went back to the provisions of the 1991 constitution which were to have the president succeeded by -- that is, have the president of the republic succeeded by the president of the National Assembly, and, in this case, that was Dr. Sindikubwabo, who was, in fact, installed as president on April the 9th.</p>

            <p>The naming of commander was perhaps predictable in the sense that he had been the candidate for prime minister of that transitional government of the MDR power faction. He had been defeated by Madam Uwilingiyimana, but his name had surfaced in July of '93, as a potential prime ministerial candidate representing the MDR power wing. Because the new government was in fact an embodiment of the Hutu power ideology, it was perhaps predictable that Kambanda would be named to that position, although his age and relative lack of national stature might have been seen to weigh against him.</p>

            <p>Certainly, the fact that members were of a single ethnic group had importance, but it would not, in and of itself, have been of major importance had that group of people represented a diversity of views. What was perhaps most significant was not the fact that they were Hutu, but the fact that they were proponents of an ideology which was extremely aggressive against Tutsi, because one could imagine a government made up of Hutu of other points of view which would have, of course, resulted in a very different outcome.</p>

            <p>It's the whole document, Mr. President. This document seems to me to be a compilation of interviews that the Accused allegedly gave to the investigators of the Tribunal where <stage>(sic)</stage> he was already a suspect. Now, I'm referring to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and Rule 42 provides that at the very least before a suspect is questioned or interviewed he should have a right to counsel and he also has the right to remain silent, and this was not respected. I think these interviews were carried out in violation of Ndindabahizi's rights and the information he provided was taken from him by a wily manner. In this case, Mr. President, I don't think it would be faithful or fair to refer during these proceedings to documents which were taken in violation of Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

            <p>There are several issues that arise here. Both Mr. Ndindabahizi and his counsel have been aware of these interviews for the last seven years. The interview I refer to and the great majority of the interviews in this bundle were obtained voluntarily -- voluntarily -- in 1996.

Rule 42 is only triggered when he was a suspect. That is as far as I understand Rule 42. To me, it applies to suspects. And they have to be able to show, and they have the burden of proof, that in 1996 Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect of the Office of the Prosecutor.</p>

We have not been informed so far whether we are -- we note that the two parties argue that Rule 42 <stage>(B)</stage> is available here and, according to the Prosecution, this -- one issue is whether he was a suspect, and the other one is whether he voluntarily waived his right to counsel and then decided to proceed with the interviews. We do not have any knowledge at this stage to conclude that there is a violation of Rule 42, and further documentation would have to be submitted to that effect, and even if there were a violation of Rule 42, the next issue would then be the effects of such a violation.

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>This paragraph confirms information which we have from a number of sources that indicates the events of the day of April 8th. As is indicated here and elsewhere, the authorities, and these were largely military, who were engineering the creation of this government had been able to assemble representatives of the other political parties which then engaged in a discussion as to which ones of their members would be named to ministerial posts. This had not been the case for the PSD, whereas I mentioned most of the national leadership had already been killed. And it was apparently in search of representatives of the PSD, so that there could be a full complement of all the parties that had been in the previous government, that Colonel Bagosora came to the residence of Mr. Nsengiyumva, where he found Mr. Ndindabahizi.On route back to the ministry of defence where the discussions were going on about forming the government, they picked up also a Mr. Ndungutse who was of the PSD membership, and it was those three who then represented the PSD in the discussions that followed and as a result of which it was concluded that Mr. Nsengiyumva would keep his cabinet post and that other two PSD posts which had become vacant -- one by the flight of the previous minister of finance, the other by the murder of the previous minister of agriculture -- that those two posts would be given to Mr. Ndindabahizi and Mr. Nsabumukunzi. This suggests to me that the process was one of, shall we say -- desperation is perhaps too strong a word, but one where there was not a multiplicity of candidates available in any case, and that, by chance, Mr. Ndindabahizi was on the scene. He was someone who had a background in finance and it was that which then tipped the scale in favour of his being named minister of finance.</p>

            <p>Yes, it was remarkable that both the préfecture of Kibuye and the préfecture of Butare were very helpfully represented. This was extremely unusual because in previous governments both of those préfectures had been very under-represented. It appears that there had been a conscious decision to reach out to those two préfectures which would not ordinarily have been within the ambit of MRND and certainly not of the MRND-Hutu Power coalition. So it was an attempt to integrate potential voices of opposition into the governmental structure so that they would then be able to cooperate in carrying forward government programmes.</p>

            <p>Of course. The president, of course, he is of great importance, and then, in addition, in the interior ministry, the actual minister of interior at the time was Mr. Munyanzesa who had not returned to Rwanda. He had been on the president's -- part of president's delegation in Dar-es-Salaam and he had not returned and he did not return. But the government continued to list him as the minister of interior until May when Mr. Karemera of Kibuye was named to replace him. But in the interim the business of the ministry of the interior was carried on by the administrative head of the ministry who was a very important figure from Butare named Callixte Kalimanzira, so it was his name that I was thinking of in terms of another figure from Butare.</p>

But at the level of bourgmestres, the MDR had gained a considerable amount of terrain and -- as had the PSD, and within some of these communes there was a very active struggle going on between those two parties and also between each party and the MRND. So it had been in the previous period an area of considerable political conflict. I should point out that in -- beginning in 1991 and going through 1992 and part of 1993, there had been very vigorous competition between political parties, and it was this that had given birth originally to the militia. They had fought against each other in this context of developing multiparty activity, attempting to secure increasing numbers of adherents. So in some cases there had been actual bloodshed between parties.</p>

            <p>As I said, the obvious political reason was to engage these areas in the execution of government policies that they might otherwise not have been inclined to support. In this connection, it's significant that Butare was the préfecture of where -- with the highest proportion of Tutsi population. It had been known over time as an area where there was considerable intermarriage and considerable harmony between Hutu and Tutsi, so that if the -- given the context of growing violence against Tutsi, were there an intention to carry out actual violence against Tutsi, it would be important to have southern leaders participating in the government authorities directing that violence. In the first hours and the first days after April 6th, a number of political opponents of the MRND and MDR were inclined to see the violence as an attempt, once again, by northerners to take control of the political scene, and it was to ensure that that image not continue, that southerners were so important to the political combination.</p>

These military and political leaders eventually also, with the help of administrative officials, were able to encourage and promote these killings which had within a period of a very few days produced a death toll of 20,000.

            <p>Indeed, in your report you describe those killed as the vast majority being Tutsi, implying obviously that there were people who were not Tutsi. You also testified, that afternoon that certain members of the initial coalition government prior to the president's death had been killed. Now my question to you is this: how did the population in Rwanda react to the initial killings of highly placed and visible moderate Hutu politicians together with these ordinary Tutsi civilians; how did they react to this?</p>

            <p>The members of those political parties whose leaders had been killed -- that is, the PSD and the wing of the MDR that was not associated with MDR Power -- the supporters of those parties saw this as basically a coup being engineered by the Hutu Power adherents with the cooperation of the military to take control of the political system, so that those people were very afraid. They felt that they could be targeted because they had been opposed to the MRND and its other allies, and many of them went into hiding.</p>

            <p>It was the position of authorities spread by them directly in speeches to the population and propagated also by the press that operated under their guidance. It was their position that Tutsi by their very ethnicity were to be regarded as allied with the military combatants, RPF, and, therefore, as, quote, accomplices or part of the enemy. This position which was put forward many times in propaganda over a period, really, of years, becomes particularly pronounced after April the 6th, when officials, administrative officials, government authorities, political leaders, referred to RPF supporters throughout the country as being necessarily linked to an equivalent with RPF combatants.It's important to remember that as a result of the peace accords the RPF had become in a sense a legitimate political party. It had been assigned positions in the transitional government to come and as a result civilians in Rwanda who had supported the RPF or had been sympathetic to its ideas, some of them in any case, now felt the confidence to come out publicly and to indicate that they were supporters of the RPF. Those people were among the first targeted and described as enemies. And over time the category grew to include anyone who was Tutsi, even those people who had never manifested any political interest or sought any political role, including women, the elderly and infants.</p>

            <p>As I explained, in those first days those Hutu who were opposed to the MRND, and sometimes just those Hutu who came from the southern part of the country, expected that they, too, could be targeted because they saw this as a coup attempt to -- or an attempt to take power by people from the north affiliated with the MRND and MDR Power. I have spoken to many people who have explained to me exactly how afraid they were in those early days, even though they were Hutu. And I have had witnesses tell me that, "Yes, we too fled with the Tutsi". Then usually they indicated to me that it was on the 12th, that they understood the message, that for the first time they got the message that the Tutsi alone was the enemy. And then they said, "We knew we were safe and then we went home".</p>

            <p>Certainly, we know that the radio was used and we have assembled excerpts from the radio in which political authorities explain that the enemy is the Tutsi, the enemy is the person who wishes to restore the monarchy, and because of Rwandan history, because the Tutsi were -- the monarch was thought to be Tutsi, because the elite which ruled with the monarch was Tutsi, "those people who want to restore the monarchy" was simply another way of saying "the Tutsi". And this was clearly stated on the radio, that these are the people who were the enemy. There was a song that was sung in the streets: "There is one enemy and he is the Tutsi".

            <p>"Infiltrators" was a term which was used to describe many people. In reference to Kigali city, it would have been a legitimate term to use in reference to several hundred RPF soldiers who entered the city illegally in violation of the Arusha Accords and who were, in fact, present in excess of the terms agreed to. But that was not the ordinary sense of the term. It was used throughout the country in areas where there was no RPF military presence and it was used to create the expectation, to create the fear that ordinary Tutsi civilians could be, in fact, infiltrators for the RPF. It was a term much like "accomplices", meant to cover the wide range of Tutsi civilians who could be perceived as people sympathetic to or in support of RPF -- the RPF force.</p>

            <p>Probably not until the end of Operation Turquoise; although, if you are looking -- I'm not sure what the boundary line was to the east, the eastern part of Kibuye. It's possible that there were RPF troops in the eastern part of Kibuye in early July, perhaps indeed the last days of June, but it depends on a closer knowledge of military events than I'm aware of. The great thrust of military activity for the RPF was beginning in the north-eastern part of the country, and moving in a crescent-shape movement along the eastern frontier and then heading west across the country. But Kibuye was pretty much preserved and then eventually was occupied by the French under Operation Turquoise. So it is possible that there was some small advance of troops in late June but I'm not sure, but certainly not before then.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Well, there were several official responses to the killings. How to express it in a concise and simple way? The bottom line is that the killing went forward. That's the most important point, that the killing went forward despite some official protestations that the government did not want killing to happen. But it's protestations were shown to be insincere, to lack meaning, by the actions that the government took and by its actions. Particularly beginning in mid-April, it's clear that the intention was to spread the killing, to expand the zones of slaughter and not to stop it.</p>

            <p>On the 11th of April 1994, representatives from various local authorities -- namely, préfets -- were summoned to a meeting in Kigali. Do you know what the purpose of this meeting was?</p>

            <p>The new government had just been installed, and I believe it was a first meeting to allow members of the government to establish contact with those people who would be administering the population at the préfectural level. It was, of course, also a time when there was massive killing already in the capital and in certain outlying areas, so presumably to -- in addition to this objective was a government objective to become informed on the situation throughout the country and presumably to give some instruction on how to deal with it.</p>

            <p>It is my understanding, based on two testimonies of people present at that meeting, that there was an exchange of information. Préfets were asked to describe the situation in their préfectures. There was some negative comment made upon two préfets in whose préfectures there had been little or no killing -- in other words, a message of disapproval for those -- and then no clear and specific orders given about halting the killings. In a political culture like that of Rwanda where direction is very much given from the top down, the absence of an order to stop killing after multiple killings have just been described can be understood only as an unspoken order to continue the killings.</p>

            <p>In your report you discuss at page 18 another meeting which took place a week after the 11th of April meeting. This time this meeting was in Gitarama préfecture. Do you know why the meeting was convened at Gitarama at this time?</p>

            <p>Gitarama was, as I explained, an area where the MDR party dominated and, as we have seen, the MDR party was divided into the power wing and another wing. The préfet of Gitarama was someone who was not of MDR Power and he had done his best to limit the killing in his préfecture. A number of bourgmestres had agreed with him and as a result there had been relatively little killing in many parts of Gitarama. On the 18th, he called a meeting of his bourgmestres at the préfecture centre to discuss further measures to try to ensure security and to stop the killing. A member of the government -- and I believe it was the prime minister -- got wind of this planned meeting by the préfet and ordered the meeting moved from the préfecture to Murambi, a place some kilometres away, where the national government had taken refuge. So, in other words, the préfet's meeting to try to stop the slaughter was taken over by the national authorities who actually moved it from the préfecture office to the place they were located, at Murambi, and then they used that occasion to make clear to the administrators of Gitarama that the killing of Tutsi was indeed the approved programme and that those administrators should begin carrying it out.</p>

            <p>The violence increased dramatically after this meeting. The hard-line position taken at the government meeting by political leaders as well as government authorities was reinforced by a series of other measures, notably by the use of militia, particularly from Kigali city and Kigali-rural préfecture, who then came into Gitarama to raid those communes where there had been little killing. And in these raids they attacked not just the Tutsi but those Hutu who had not participated in the killing. At the same time, radio RTLM was used to ridicule and to threaten certain bourgmestres, such as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune for not being sufficiently strong in carrying out action against the, quote, unquote, accomplices. So it was a pressure which was exerted both by direct, official discourse at this meeting, then reinforced by militia and reinforced by the media, and the effect was that killing in Gitarama increased enormously.</p>

            <p>Butare was the préfecture which resisted the killings longest and as of mid-April there had been relatively few people killed there. Gikongoro was a more mixed situation because you had some MRND leaders who were strong -- for example, in Mubuga -- not in Mubuga, but in the subpréfecture around Mubuga and in other parts of Gikongoro who were, in fact, carrying out considerable killing but you had areas like Musabeya commune where there was still resistance. So Butare was the clearest case at a préfectural level while Gikorongoro was more mixed, but some communes were still resisting.</p>

            <p>The weekend of April 16th and 17th, was a turning point. It was that weekend when it became clear to the government of Rwanda that there would be no new UN intervention and that, in fact, the UN peacekeeping troops would probably all be pulled out. In fact, they were not. Later in the week a small number -- a decision was made by the Security Council to leave a small number of them but, as of the end of the day, April 15th, which was a Friday, the sentiment at the Security Council was to pull out everyone. That was known certainly to the Rwandan government in Rwanda because Rwanda had a representative sitting on the Security Council at that time. It was a non-permanent member and, therefore, was privy to these discussions. On the Saturday, after that Friday afternoon, the government decreed a change in military leadership removing General Gatsinzi as chief of staff and replacing him with someone who was known to be much more hard line in his attitude towards Tutsi and at the same time they removed the préfet of Butare and the préfet of Kibungo; that is to say, that same weekend. The Monday morning after was the Monday morning when the national political authorities took over the Gitarama meeting from the préfet, and the day after that, the Tuesday, was the day when national political authorities descended to Butare and to Gikongoro to carry the same message that they had passed to the Gitarama administrators on Monday; namely, "You are all involved; there is no way that you abstain from this; it is time to get to work".</p>

            <p>After the préfet of Butare was removed and a new préfet was named, a very important delegation, including the president and the prime minister and a number of ministers, went to Butare to participate in the installation and power of the new préfet. This was a remarkable display of force to arrive in Butare, people in such a numerous delegation, and one which had added importance because, of course, the president and the prime minister were from that same préfecture.Rwanda is a very small country, one where political authority from the centre has always been very important and where that political authority is sometimes exercised by members of the national government going home to their places of origin to carry the particular message of the national government, and it was in that context that the arrival of this strong delegation, led by the two Butare political leaders, has to be seen. The speeches given by the prime minister and the president -- the president's speech, in part, was broadcast on radio -- had enormous importance in setting the clear line that everyone had to choose sides, that you either had to be in favour of this government, and that meant in favour of its programme, a programme of genocide, or you were against it; it was not possible to remain in-between. And that was a message which was decided upon apparently the weekend of the 15th, 16th, 17th April, and then was implemented beginning the following week and carried forward throughout the genocide. There was no possibility of a middle ground. You were either with the government or you were against it. If you were against it, then you would expect to pay the consequences, and those consequences were symbolised in Butare by the public humiliation of the préfet -- the removed préfet who was publicly humiliated at the installation ceremonies of his successor. He was then hunted down and eventually killed, as were all the members of his family. </p>

            <p>Mr. President, our objections are based on four arguments. The first being that this document was disclosed to us two days ago and that the document which is under tab one, in green, which seems to be a photocopy of an original in Kinyarwanda, was disclosed to the Defence only a few minutes before this session. That is already a violation of Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.Our second argument is that this document seems to have come from Préfet Kayishema, who, apparently alone, wrote the transcripts more than a month after the said meeting. If we were to refer to the translation in English, we will come to realise that a cover letter is signed by Préfet Kayishema and it's dated 8th June 1994. We are unaware of the sources of Préfet Kayishema for the drafting of these minutes. We do not know whether Mr. Kayishema used recordings of the meeting. We do not know whether he was using his memory in order to draft these minutes. Above all, we do not know whether Mr. Kayishema did not voluntarily or otherwise, modify the real words which were pronounced during the said meeting. We should not forget that Mr. Kayishema was sentenced for life by this Tribunal for the crime of genocide, and it is possible that he may have favourably, for his own interest, modified this document. We therefore believe, to conclude with that argument, that only Préfet Kayishema can authentify <stage>(sic)</stage> this document, and that it would be useful to call him to the Bar in order that he authenticate this document. Our third argument is that we find some information to be suspect in this document. If we were to refer to the English translation, in other words, tab 3, at page 24, we realise that this document is signed by a rapporteur who is named Joseph Bugingo. On the following page, we have a list of participants at the meeting, and we see that participant No. 11 is one Mr. Joseph Bugingo, whose address is Kibuye Prison. We are wondering how a rapporteur of that meeting could at the same time be a prisoner at the Kibuye prison. We also note that the person at No. 26 is Mr. Augustin Karara, bourgmestre of Gitesi, who was also at Kibuye prison, that's his address, and we know that the bourgmestre of Gitesi, Mr. Karara, was imprisoned only much later. We therefore believed that this document is suspect, and, therefore, arises the question of its authenticity. Our fourth and last argument is that, we know -- we are aware that in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Niyitegeka -- I don't know whether it was the document in this form, but that document was not admitted as an exhibit in that case. In the session of 20th June 2002, at 11:30, the Prosecutor stated that she could not guarantee neither the authenticity nor the fullness or completeness of the transcripts. This is the case of the Prosecutor v. Niyitegeka. The date of the transcript was 20th June 2002. Therefore, we raise objections regarding the authenticity of this document, and we advise -- we submit that it be not accepted as an exhibit, Mr. President, Your Honours. </p>

            <p>Your Honour, we have certain procedural issues here. The first is that the transcript of the May 3rd meeting has been known to almost everyone of this Tribunal for several years. Certainly my learned friend has come across it more often than once, he was in the Kayishema case. But, in any event, the matters he raises in relation to the authenticity of this document are not questions that I can answer, they come from my evidence unit. As far as we are concerned, there is a photocopy there, and these were documents that were actually found on Mr. Kayishema's person when he was arrested, and I don't see what the prejudice is to my learned friend, quite honestly. I know he has profound reason to be worried of its content, like he does in many of the other things, including matters that were actually said and spoken by his client. But, I mean -- that's not my problem. The document exists, there from the evidence unit, they're K'ed as you have rightly observed and we want to put it to this witness. </p>

            <p>Yes, it was a speech like many others of the time, which can be read at different levels. First of all, I find it interesting that he does refer to a document which is an authenticated document, a real document, and that is the instructions for restoring security dated April 27th. That is a document that I collected myself and I am convinced with its authenticity, and he speaks about that document, which was a document that was attempting to organise the so-called security measures which were being imposed to control the movement of Tutsi and to track them down. It's a speech which, on the one hand, talks about the need for peace and for the negotiations, but on the other hand, repeats a number of pernicious ideas, i.e. including that there are RPF soldiers throughout the country in every commune and that they are posing an imminent danger to the population. This is of greatest importance because, perhaps the strongest argument that the government authorities made to the civilian population was: "You are in danger, the RPF is going to exterminate you if you do not protect yourselves". And it was this appeal to self-preservation which made, in the eyes of many people, made their behaviour legitimate, the idea that they were doing what they were doing, they were killing only to protect themselves. It was a measure of self-defence, and, therefore, it's legitimate, and that is the basic thrust of the prime minister's remarks that this is something you must do to protect yourselves. </p>

            <p>The argument that the RPF had always intended to resume the war, and that evidence is given of this in terms of documents that were said to have been found with its members that showed how this war was planned in 1993 and early 1994. I think that is what this translation is meant to say, although it's awkwardly worded. This is important because in developing the theme of self-defence, local authorities often would find "evidence", that is objects which had been deliberately planted with people in order to prove their allegations that these were RPF infiltrators and that there was an immediate danger to the population. So often you would have cases where a bourgmestre would, for example, come out of the home of someone who had been killed and hold up a piece of paper and say: "You see, here is the list, here is the list of RPF people in this community. They have paid dues, you can see that this is written on this paper, and these are the people who must be killed". In other examples, you would have, for example, the discovery of arms which had already been planted -- which had previously been planted by the authorities, and so, soldiers would go -- and there was a case at Kibungo Cathedral, where they went and discovered arms in the bushes behind the Cathedral, arms they themselves had placed there in order to prove to the population that the danger was real. So this kind of cinema -- this kind of play-acting was something that was carried out on a systematic basis in many parts of the country. We have reports of this from many different places. So, I would draw your attention here to this reference to documents which were found supposedly and which proved the existence of plans for war. In the next paragraph, the assertion that the RPF never wanted any power sharing, but what it wanted was exclusive power for itself. That was also a frequent allegation made. The paragraph after that, the RPF wanted the Rwandan government to remain paralysed from December '93 until the time it would seize power. It was true that the government was paralysed during that time in part because of disagreements between Habyarimana and other members of the government. But here, it is also attributed to an RPF plot, everything is seen in terms of an RPF plot, all of these events. The allegation again that it was making preparations to take over the country. And then comes a very important paragraph saying, no Rwandan leader will ever again be negligent, will never be deceived again. And if there had been no accomplices among Rwandan leaders, if there had been Interahamwe, Rwanda would not have fallen so low. The official position was that there had been "accomplices" among those members of the government who had negotiated the Arusha Peace Accords, and it was because they were RPF accomplices, that they had signed away the kind of concessions that had been agreed to, and the point here is that if these people had been Interahamwe, a reference to the MRND militia group that was then engaged in killing Tutsi, if we had had people of that quality in our leadership, then there would have been -- Rwanda would never have been in the position it is in now. And then once again, coming back to this theme of the found documents -- the retrieved documents, it is no longer a secret as evidenced by retrieved documents that the RPF had soldiers in each commune, whose objective was to exterminate us one day. Clearly, this is a false statement. Clearly any responsible politician would have known it was a false statement. It led the population to believe that ordinary civilians were to be identified as "soldiers", and, of course, it was legitimate to attack soldiers who were intending to kill you. On the radio there were a number of messages which said: "You must be aware of the RPF, they are found out throughout the country. They are wearing civilian clothes, so that you must not believe that a civilian is necessarily a civilian." In that context, this kind of message telling people that in each and every commune of this country there are RPF soldiers, that is a very dangerous message to communicate, and particularly when you then add to it that the objective of these people is to exterminate us. That was a message that went back to 1992, even in 1991, for the first time, you guard MRND pamphlets circulating, saying the objective of the Tutsi is to exterminate the Hutu, to carry out a genocide of the Hutu. Improbable as that seems, given a relative demographics of the country, this was the argument that was made, and here the speaker has taken off that theme and is presenting it to the audience, saying to them: "You must remember that all around you there are these "soldiers" who mean to exterminate you". And then dropping down two paragraphs, the RPF has become too confident about its strength. It has openly stated that it wants a ministry for Tutsis, that of justice. The ministry of justice was at that time held by a member of the power branch of the Liberal Party, Agnés Ntamabyaliro who was from Kibuye. So here he is saying the ministry that belongs to one of our Kibuye citizens is going to be taken over for the Tutsi, which is quite remarkable because according to the peace treaty, the RPF had the legitimate right to a number of ministry seats, but they were not seats for Tutsi, they were seats for members of the RPF political party. So, you see that the shift in speech -- the shift in discourse so that the RPF becomes the Tutsi. The ethnic group is the important reference here not the political party. And then the speaker called on PSD members to join others, again the Hutu power theme. We must all join together in fighting for the country's security, even if many accomplices were from their party, it's a kind of apology. You know, it is unfortunate that some PSD people were actually supporters of the peace treaty, were supporters of an alliance with the RPF. Those people, of course, have since been killed. But here, the sentiment expressed, you know, even if some of your party members had been on the wrong side, it's all right, we will go forward and continue to fight this fight. It happened also in other parties, some reassurance to the PSD members: "Don't be ashamed". People in other parties also held those ideas which did not mean that this party should stop working. There I would have to refer to the Kinyarwanda text to see if this is really a use of work in the sense of killing people. I can't make that conclusion without looking at the text and thinking about it. But in any case, the speaker then calls upon PSD members to join the civil defence in big numbers. Now, the civilians of defence movement was an effort organised by the national government to channel and control the killing of Tutsi which was threatening to spin out of control, and here he is asking members of his party to join in that effort. And the final paragraph, asking the people to point out any leader who might lead them astray. In other words, asking for popular denunciation of any bourgmestre, cell leader, conseiller, who was not actively participating in the government programme, and this fits with an effort that was made throughout this period to remove those officials and authorities as the préfet of Butare had been removed; as the préfet of Kibungo was removed, as the préfet of Gitarama eventually, because they were not sufficiently active. So here is an open door to popular denunciation of authorities who were not actively involved, because it's now clear which side each supported, and you will be able to see clearly if your bourgmestre, conseiller is on the right side or not, and if he is on the wrong side, then you should denounce him.</p>

            <p>At page 25 of your expert report, you describe both these meetings of 3rd May and the meeting in Butare under the heading of "Pacification". Now, why would you describe these two meetings as in that context, why the word pacification? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>That was the term that was used by the authorities themselves to describe their efforts. And it's important to come to terms with the word and to understand its meaning, because on the surface, one would say a government engaged in pacification should be congratulated, but that was not the case here. As you will see by examining these speeches and not purely the one I have just referred to, but if you look back at the speech of Mr. Murego, which is very interesting, the MDR person, on page 11, you will see that he says very clearly: "The enemy is the RPF and its accomplices, not all Tutsis are accomplices". So you have a message which is ambiguous, which is a double message, and throughout the whole pacification effort, it is a double message but often it is the militia leaders engaged in the worst killing, who are the ones in charge of pacification, which gives you a sense of what the term meant. It was a policy adopted by the government for several reasons: One, because they needed to try to convince the international community that what they were doing was not a genocide. For another in some places, it was clearly used to lure Tutsi out of hiding, to say to them, the killing is finished, it is safe to come back and then they were killed. And then, in other cases, it needs to be understood in the complex dynamics among Hutu themselves because what happened eventually was that the killers began killing each other. And pacification was meant to make clear who the target was and to say to people, you may not kill for jealousy or greed or personal motives; you must kill only for the right reasons and the right people. So pacification was meant also to persuade, particularly those young men who had now been given guns and grenades, that they were not to use them on other Hutu who happened to be members of other political parties or people with whom they had quarrels or people they just intended to rob. So it was an attempt to take control of the violence and to channel it and to make sure it reached its object. </p>

            <p>Now at some stage during the genocide, Madam Witness, were there Tutsis married to Hutus who were saved? Now, do you know, first of all, why that was the case? Why were Tutsis married to Hutu men -- Tutsi women married to Hutu men not killed in the early part of April, and did that policy change at some stage, and, if so, why? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>There are many Tutsi who survived because Hutu protected them. In some cases, husbands protected their wives. In this particular instance, there is another aspect to the situation, and that is that women have been received -- that men have received their wives in return for payment to the bride's family. They have paid in a sense for the productive and reproductive services of that wife. If Hutu men are permitted to kill the Tutsi wives of other Hutu men, those men -- those other Hutu men, are deprived of their investment and will feel justly aggrieved. What have they done to lose this wife in whom they have invested? So it was in order to avoid conflict among Hutu, that in many places there was an actual instruction given that Tutsi wives were not to be touched. That policy changed eventually, although we have no official declaration of it, but if you look at the facts from mid-May on, there is an increase in attacks on women and children; also on people who had been generally protected by communities, nurses, teachers, others who rendered service to the community had often been protected. But from mid-May on, there was -- it appears a change in policy and the directive to kill was to kill all Tutsi regardless of age or gender.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>I don't know, Your Honour. The genocide is an enormously complex phenomenon with many dynamic turns and twists, and what motivated this particular one, I am not absolutely sure, but there are two possibilities; one is that there was -- the RPF was advancing very successfully on many fronts and there may have been a fear. There was a fear that the war could be lost, and if it were lost, that those people responsible for the killing could be brought to justice, and women who were left could testify against them. And we see, for example, that on the radio, at about this time, there were some very strong statements about "you need have no fear, all you must do is win this war and then there will be not all of this talk of international justice of commissions and tribunals. All of that will fade away if only you win". So there may have been a fear that, in fact, they were losing and that these women could be witnesses. The second consideration is that it was in mid-May that the French were originally -- were first talking seriously about an intervention that eventually becomes operation turquoise -- it doesn't actually arrive in Rwanda until the third week in June, but it was already being discussed and known to Rwandan authorities at that time, and perhaps the fear that outside observers could also come across witnesses who would then convince the French to change their policy and could make known to the world what was happening, perhaps that was part of it.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Madam Witness. Finally, Madam Witness, if we go to the area of your testimony described on page 26 as governmental control, certainly the events and the massacres that took place on 11th April to 1st May 1994, happened while the government was either in Kigali or Gitarama, and you say here that the government continued to function. When I look at page 3 of your report and contrast what you say in relation to the attacks in 1990 at Kibilira commune, I wondered if you'd have any comments on the reaction of the government in 1994 to attacks and the reaction of the government as you outlined on page 3, in 1990? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>At the time of the Kibilira massacre in 1990, the authorities waited three days to intervene during which time some 300 people were killed. When the authorities finally did decide to intervene, it took only the arrival of the national police and their blowing of a whistle to stop the killing. Now in 1994, the situation was considerably more complex. The number of actors was multiplied enormously in scale. The wartime situation was far worse; people were suffering from real hunger and dire poverty, so that the economic impetus for involvement was greater than it would have been for the people at Kibilira in 1990. But it is important, I think, to underline that the killing after April 1994, like the killing in Kibilira in 1990, was not spontaneous. In most cases, it was organised and directed, and there is no better proof of that than the information that I have presented already today about how the killing in the centre and south of the country had to be sparked by government action, by pressure from the radio, by the movement of militias into areas that had previously been peaceful. Had the government pressure not been there, had the directives not come from government officials that you must join, you cannot stay silent, you cannot be inactive; had those messages not been given, it is highly unlikely that we would have witnessed anything like this genocide. So the role of the authorities, the legitimisation that they gave was of enormous importance. </p>

            <p>Many roadblocks were located outside of bars or restaurants and little drinking places, places where beer was brewed, for the simple reason that that gave the people at the barrier easy access to drink. In a somewhat grizzly analogy, you might think of the phenomenon of businesses that support a football team and give their sponsorship to a football team. In some cases there were businessmen or bar owners who gave their sponsorship to a barrier, then the barrier would be set up outside of their bar and they would provide the people at the barrier with drink and with food. That was their contribution to the cause. This meant that people at the barrier, many of them were drunk or in some cases high on drugs. </p>

The concern to pay people at all levels and to pay them regularly was an important one, we can see it reflected in the speech of Prime Minister Kambanda in Butare in mid-May, when he made a great deal about a promise to give some form of compensation to the lowest level of administrative cadres, political leaders who had not been paid. It is clear that if the government intended to ensure the execution of its orders among its administrative cadres, it would have a far better chance of doing so if those people were paid and thought that they were representing a functioning, legitimate government. </p>

            <p>Finally, Madam Witness, on page 5 of your report, you outline the administrative structure in Rwanda as it existed in 1994. In your submission on page 5, you indicate that although the bourgmestre ranked below the préfet or souspréfet, he exercised more immediate and persuasive power over ordinary people than did his superiors. Now, can you explain how that happened and what the significance of that was in 1994, in relation to the killings? </p>

            <p>The bourgmestre was the authority whom ordinary Rwandans saw most often, that is the authority of importance. They saw other authorities more frequently, for example, conseillers. But the bourgmestre was the nearest really important person to ordinary Rwandans. He had the power to mediate disputes, to settle all kinds of conflicts. He had the power to lock them up in the lockup, in the cachot, to impose fines and he also had control of the distribution of land, and for an agricultural population, there is nothing more important than access to land. In theory the property -- the land of the nation belongs to the government, and it was the bourgmestre who had the right of distribution. During the genocide the bourgmestre was the senior local authority who was the most important one in mobilising the population, giving directions, punishing those or authorising the punishment of those who did not obey directions, and rewarding those who did. It's remarkable how soon after the first violence we have proof of attempts to control the distribution of the property of the people killed. Within days committees were set up to supervise the various forms of property and to organise the distribution of land, in particular, to those who have participated. So the bourgmestre as the senior local authority in charge of all of this, and as the person who was the bridge, the liaison from the population to political party structures, to administrative structures, and eventually even to military structures, it was the bourgmestre who channelled all of those orders to the population and ensured that people obeyed them.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, a clarification for the Tribunal. I mentioned a session which took place in the Niyitegeka case on the 12th -- on the 20th of June 2002. I think there was mention of transcripts from audio cassettes of the meeting of the 3rd of May, so maybe it's not quite the same thing. So, since these audio cassettes do exist and that they appeared in the Niyitegeka case, why not listen to them so that we can determine the authenticity of words attributed to Mr. Ndindabahizi? If the Prosecutor does not take that initiative, the Defence will do so, and I wish to bring this to the attention of the Bench. As for my cross-examination, Mr. President, Your Honours --</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. As for my cross-examination of Dr. Alison Des Forges, I wish to say that her testimony does not directly concern Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. We have gone through history; we have done sociology and politics, and now we need to go into law. When I was contacted for this case, I received an indictment which was dated 7th July 2001 in which my client was accused for conspiracy to commit genocide, and the individual responsibility of the Accused was taken into consideration under Article 6 <stage>(3);</stage> in other words, command responsibility. In the two indictments, paragraphs 20 to 23 concern exclusively the meeting of 3rd May in Kibuye. And this is very different from the current situation, Your Honours. In the indictment in its last amended version, there is nothing said about the Accused as a member of the government. The meeting of the 3rd May disappears from the indictment; it is no longer included in the indictment which was amended pursuant to your decision of 3rd June 2003. As for the activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as minister, we find traces of that at page 1 of the indictment; in other words, the general presentation of the Accused person, but in no paragraph whatsoever of the indictment do we find anything whatsoever concerning the activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi within the government or, of course, his participation or attendance of the meeting of the 3rd of May. Consequently, the Defence believes that Miss Alison Des Forges's report can be considered as a piece of information, but the Defence would consider it superfluous in this case, given the allegations against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. That is why, Mr. President, Your Honours, that I have only one question for Dr. Alison Des Forges, and the question is as follows.</p>

            <p>Good afternoon, Madam Expert. I think you have written this important document, that Let None Be Left to Tell the Story <stage>(sic).</stage> I think this document -- this is a very document -- an important book which has more than 900 pages, and I would like to know in how many instances do you refer to Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in that book. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Without referring to the book, I could not be absolutely sure because, in fact, the index unfortunately is not reliable. So, there is no quick and easy way to ascertain whether there is any mention anywhere of Mr. Ndindabahizi, but I can certainly say that if he is mentioned, it is only in a relatively minor role and perhaps, for example, in a list of members of the government. This is not surprising, given that the focus of the book was predominantly Butare préfecture and, after that, activities of the national government, and only occasionally drew information from Gikongoro or Kibuye for comparative purposes. </p>

            <p>Do you have any knowledge about this document from the 3rd of May; in other words, its origins, where it comes from?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-des-forges">
            <speaker>WITNESS DES FORGES:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Your Honour, I have some knowledge of this document. I had previously seen the attached list of persons who attended the meeting; that is, not the minutes themselves but the attached list of names of persons who attended. This was in conjunction with a deportation proceeding in the United States where I served as an expert witness and where that list was used to establish that the person in question had attended that particular meeting. I do not recall having seen these -- the minutes themselves before they were shown to me by the Prosecutor perhaps a month ago. I, of course, knew about the meeting. It had been described to me by a number of witnesses. And I have since looked at some other documents that I know to be authentic from Kibuye. I know them to be authentic because they were gathered by my colleagues from the local offices. And I note certain surface similarities, in any case, that would lead me to conclude that this is in its presentation certainly an authentic document. There is a similarity in the signatures -- although this is obviously a very poor sample -- and in the seal, but more interesting perhaps are the serial numbers, the identification numbers in the upper right-hand corner of the documents. In the exhibit presented to the Court today, it appears to me to be No. 325, perhaps -- although that may have been corrected -- /04.09.01. And I have previous documents from a month earlier that bear the same classification number at the end but at the start have the classification number 0280. So that would mean if this were 0325, in approximately a month's time, that would be perhaps a reasonable number of letters to have been sent on the subject of security. This is the category that has to do with security, I believe. In addition to that, I would say the procedure as I am familiar with it would have been for someone to take the notes at the meeting, and that was apparently Mr. Bugingo, and then to write them up. We have no indication of when he wrote them up. He might have written them up the same day. What we have is the date on the letter when the notes were forwarded from the prefect to the prime minister, which was obviously approximately a month later, but that does not establish the notes were made a month later. My other comment would be based simply on a reading of the text, that the use of words, the kinds of themes, to me, fit well with other similar speeches given in similar circumstances. And in this regard, if you recall, I mentioned -- I pointed out to you the phrase in Mr. Murego's speech where he said, "Not all Tutsi are accomplices." Had the document been completely fake and an attempt to establish a totally biased document, a phrase like that would not be found. It's too contradictory to the sense. It's in reality that we find contradictions. Things which are false are often too simple. So, that would lead me to believe it to be authentic, as well as the identification numbers, the signature, the presentation of the document. But, of course, I cannot attest to the accuracy of the notes taken, whether the note taker actually paid attention and did a good job.</p>

And the date is the 8th of June '94, as you said, about a month after the meeting. Now, the method is number and then possibly "325" or "B25" written by hand. Now, this mixture between handwriting and typewritten versions in that part of the document, would that coincide with what you have seen in other documents from Kibuye, or is it different? </p>

            <p>Your Honour, it is exactly the same. If you would like to take a look at this other document which I simply happen to have on my desk, it's very similar in appearance. It's also -- I don't know if it has a K-number or not, but it is a document from the Office of the Prosecutor in any case. But you'll see that the format is very much the same; it's the same mixture of handwritten and typewritten. It is not produced by the same typewriter, however. That is different. </p>

I don't think I will ask you anything about the other document in dispute. And no decision, of course, has been taken as to whether there is any kind of relevance by this document. Whether it's relevant is quite a different matter and I have certainly noted, together with the two other Judges, your statement, Defence Counsel, that as the indictment stands now, according to you, it is of limited relevance.

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>No, no. You've asked the question that we would have posed to the witness. Just to draw Your Honours' attention to a matter raised by the Defence in relation to the annotation on the English version of this list. The issue raised by the Defence which forms, to my mind, the basis of his challenge of the authenticity of this document is as follows: if you look at the list of participants in the English version, which is in tab 3, at the end of tab 3, you would see that against the names of Joseph Bugingo, listed on No. 11, and Augustin Karara, which is listed on No. 26, there is a notation on there that that -- or those persons, apart from being in Kibuye préfecture, are also in Kibuye prison, and the argument runs thus, that, well, if this document was prepared in 1994, those guys were not in prison then, why is it indicated thereon that they are in Kibuye prison? Well, that's true and it's a legitimate point to make. What I would then do is to draw Your Honours' attention to the original document in Kinyarwanda which is under tab 1, and then if you cross-reference and look at the list, the original list, all these are translations, English-French. If you look at the original list under tab 1, at the end of it, and you look against No. 11 and No. 26, Karara, Augustin and Bugingo, there is no indication on there that they're in Kibuye prison. The reason is obvious: the English translation must have been translated at a later stage beyond -- well beyond 1994. Whoever did it probably knew that those two people were in custody and made the notation. The operative document is the one in Kinyarwanda. I don't speak Kinyarwanda but it's pretty obvious from the level on 26 that there's no notation on there of Kibuye prison; therefore, it defeats the argument. The operative document is in Kinyarwanda, not in English, and I just wanted to bring that to Your Honours' attention.</p>

Now, on the one hand, I see that there are K-numbers both in the English and French versions in this document, but it doesn't really transpire except from -- for instance, to use the English version, after the blue separator, after this blue paper, this blue stuff here, you find K0217398 and, there, there is a reference I see to a date: "Today, the 30th of November 1996, I interviewed Mr. Emmanuel-ndindabahizi", but there is -- usually, when there are interviews previously, Mr. Phillips, then we have a cover page, something explaining who were the investigators; there may be an introduction about the witness being informed about his rights, all that kind of stuff we usually find. We don't find it here. Is this an excerpt? Where are we here? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>The explanation is very simple, Your Honour. In 1996 Mr. Ndindabahizi was in the Republic of Kenya, in exile. Our investigators knew he was there. He was not at that time a suspect, and he was cooperating with the office of the investigator in relation to other persons who were subsequently arrested in that country. That is the basis from which he was often contacted by investigators, and these were notes of those meetings that were held with him at various periods between 1996 and 1997.After some time the subject matter left Kenya and went to Belgium. In between, investigations had revealed that the Office of the Prosecutor might be interested in indicting him, but that was several years afterwards. At the time they were talking to him on these matters, he was not on our suspect list, and these were exploratory meetings with Mr. Ndindabahizi. It was not even proposed that he would be a witness in any particular case; rather, they were just asking him, "What are you all about and what's your story?" They were clearly exploratory. The statements and the interviews are not disputed, at least as far as my learned friend and I are concerned. We have talked about this on several occasions before today. It is not in dispute. Whether or not he has issues with the procedure, the legalities of it and the procedure under Rule 42, that's a separate matter but, in essence, the Defence don't dispute that Mr. Ndindabahizi was in regular contact with my office in the early days after the genocide whilst he was exiled in Kenya. That is not in dispute. So, to answer Your Honour's question, these are the circumstances that form the background to all the notes contained in these interviews. He was helping my office with investigations concerning several other people that are mentioned there, and if you actually read the first interview, you will see it talks about everybody else, apart from Mr. Ndindabahizi, because that was the context in which it was obtained. The first one talked about him because they wanted to explore and find out the extent of his possible culpability in genocide, so they asked him all these general questions about what he was doing, and then went back and started working with him in relation to the finances of the interim government and other people who might have been involved in the transaction of arms and other matters. And that's how this -- that's the long and short of how these interviews have arisen. They then were stored into our database, our evidential database, brought to our knowledge, promptly disclosed to the Defence in all the languages. There was no issue raised. I met with my learned friend in Paris over this, no objections, and the authenticity of the document is not in dispute. I see Your Honour's point that it is not signed, it doesn't have the -- but they were not generated in the context of -- in that context; they were just statements of, you know,Mr. Ndindabahizi. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Are you able to confirm this, Defence, that the substance of these -- I understand, actually, that there are only two interviews in these folders: one rather voluminous, one typewritten; and one more limited which seems to be an excerpt because there are three dots at the beginning. Now, is it true that there is no dispute concerning these two documents? The point is taken about Rule 42, of course. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>No, Mr. President, the issue is not the authenticity of this document. The issue is to determine if the rights of the Accused were violated, if any of the investigators had the possibility of interviewing the Accused at the time he was a suspect. I think this interview or discussion was such that they do not -- such that it is not possible to enter these documents into evidence. The issue was to know whether Mr. Ndindabahizi was a suspect at the time he was interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal. At the time, indeed, he was a suspect because the list of witnesses as was presented for confirmation by the Prosecution, Witness No. 1 testified 19th August 1996 against Mr. Ndindabahizi and Witness 25 testified against Mr. Ndindabahizi 10th November 1994. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>So, obviously, he was a suspect. The second thing is to know the content of what Mr. Ndindabahizi -- is it accusations against other accused or is it some biographical material. Defence thinks that it is the biographical material against the Accused and we believe these documents have been tainted by the violation of Rule 42 against Mr. Ndindabahizi. It has to do with the protection of the rights of the Accused, protection of the rights of the suspect. </p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>You see, often when -- it's often usual to see matters in context. And I just want to clarify whether behind this procedural discussion, this question of the rights under Rule 42, whether there is something else; in other words, whether there is a dispute as to whether these two documents are authentic -- I understand that they may well be so - and, secondly, whether there is a dispute as to the substance of the document, and it would be useful for the Bench to know that even if that's not the key issue here because otherwise the whole question about the procedural rights becomes a little bit abstract. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>The answer to your two questions is no, I'm not challenging the substance of these two documents. But the protection of the rights of a suspect is not only an abstract issue, it's a question of law and a question of justice.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>And there I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly, but it was a little bit difficult to see what this procedural issue was about without knowing whether this was linked to some other matters; namely, the two issues I raised now. But now the situation is clarified. That was helpful. Thank you very much. Then we will come back to these two documents later on, after having looked at them and possibly having received anything from the Defence in the same context. Then you made an application, Mr. Phillips, on Monday that we should review a decision we made concerning the admissibility of a witness statement of a witness, and the question was raised in connection with P20. The Judges have deliberated and we have looked carefully at your arguments, but our inclination is that we will not review or decision and we stick to that one, even after having considered your arguments under Rule 92bis. So, what you therefore have to do is possibly, if you really think that element is necessary to your case, then you must envisage to call that witness -- I think it was CGD, or whoever -- who had that reference to the father where someone may have hidden, but whether you will wish to call the witness for that purpose is, of course, another matter. So, that's the decision of the Chamber. Could we now, then, finally hear anything about the witnesses? I assume that even if they were planned to come on Friday, you may, in spite of that, have some indications and more recent information, or is that not the case? </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Regrettably not, Your Honour. We have no indication in relation to the detained witness, which is No. 11 on your list -- who is No. 11 on your list, and the witness No. 14, the one with the mistaken identity -- the mistaken identity case -- will come on Friday and hopefully -- hopefully, witness No. 11 on your list would come on Friday as well and in that case we'll be able to wrap our case up by Monday. But I was actually hoping they could have brought them today or tomorrow, but it's not possible.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, all right. Now, there will be a need for a pre-Defence conference. We will need a status conference then early next week in order to plan the next stage of this trial. Do you have any information to provide as to the timing of that conference, for instance, and substance matters that you would wish to raise? </p>

            <p>Mr. President, I'm at the disposal of the Court to hold a pre-Defence conference. We've already worked in collaboration with the witness protection section, as we committed ourselves; we are ready to call our witnesses within a period of three weeks beginning from the end of the -- the end of the Prosecution's case. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">

            <p>That's good, and then we can discuss the exact timing and the number of witnesses and other related matters, shall we say, on Tuesday? Would Tuesday be good if we finish the witnesses? Because now if only one witness would arrive on Monday, then we will actually have spare time on Monday so then we could all be ready for the pre-Defence conference on Monday. Would that be all right? </p>

        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Good afternoon, Your Honours. We propose to call first, Witness CGP -- Charlie, Golf, Papa -- who is now known by the name on the witness statement which is on your desk. That document, Your Honour, is in French. We only received it today -- at least over the weekend. I only got it today, and it is a statement that confirms the circumstances that form the background to the mistaken identity of this witness and the person listed on No. 14. Essentially, it is the witness confirming that the interview did occur as indicated on the 4th of April, and that the signature on the witness statement contained on pages 152 and 158 relate to him, Your Honour. I don't know what my learned friend's position is -- latest position is in relation to this witness, but in anticipation of any issues that you might have, we have the investigators that took the original statement here in Arusha. We brought them in over the weekend so that you can hear directly from them the circumstances that led to this mix-up, and to also afford my learned friend of the Defence opportunity to put questions to them prior to hearing the witness himself.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Now, these investigators that are not on the witness list, are they Mr. Amahumisiliza and Ms. Julia Watson?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, that is correct. Both of them are present, but only one of them needs to give evidence, and that may be Julie Watson.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>So, you are offering Julie Watson?</p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>I am offering both of them, Your Honours, but either of them can give evidence.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Yes, all right. So there are two issues, one starting with CGP and the other one whether we want to hear the investigators.Defence, please.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Defence cannot absolutely work under such conditions, and Defence would like to oppose the calling of Witness CGP.We base this on two arguments. First of all, the combined provisions of Rule 20 -- Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure obligate the Prosecutor to disclose the name of the witness at the very least 21 days before the beginning of the case. In respect of CGP, this has not been done, and his identity was disclosed only on the 26th September 2003. However, the name and address of the witness are an extremely important element. Indeed, Defence could have interrogated -- examined, cross-examined the witnesses of Prosecution who have already appeared on the possible presence of CGP at the sites in Gitwa.Until now Defence has tried to assess the credibility of witnesses by cross-examining them on the presence of other witnesses and sometimes by even giving their names on a piece of paper, so that Defence could have verified if the witness has not already testified in judicial proceedings in Rwanda, or more generally, on any relevant investigations on the file.Defence is therefore of the opinion that this would prejudice its case pursuant to Rule 66, and also that this runs counter to Rule 85 <stage>(B)</stage> and 90 <stage>(G)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure if this witness was allowed to testify.Secondly, the Defence is of the view that the Court should examine this issue in relation to Rule 95 of the Rules. Indeed, the context in which this witness is being called appears a bit strange to us.In October 2001 Defence received 26 statements -- redacted statements and under No. 13 there were two statements for Witness CGP dated 4th April 2001 and 2nd June 2001.Registry, can you please hand on this document to the Court and the Prosecution. The first of these statements appear in the bundle of documents disclosed by the Prosecutor, and this is the second statement. The similarities between these statements are extremely worrying. First of all, in both cases the witness refers to events that occurred at Gitwa in Gitesi commune. Secondly, in both cases, it is claimed the Accused was distributing machetes. Thirdly, in both cases, the witness points out that the presence of a certain bourgmestre who has already been mentioned, and the préfecture Kayishema. Fourthly, the witness leaves Gitwa to go to Bisesero.In conclusion, it is impossible to say that there are two separate witnesses or one and the same witness. Finally, which one did the investigators investigate? And it is surprising that the error of identity persisted until last week when the witness was transferred to Arusha. All this discredits the testimony such that if they are admitted they will go -- they will run counter to the integrity of the Court.Defence therefore concludes that Witness CGP should not be allowed to testify. Thank you,Mr. President.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, I hear what my learned friend for the Defence has said. But a lot of issues that he raised, unfortunately I am unable to answer to because I did not take the statements, but in terms of the legal issues that are raised, to my mind there are two issues here, and the main issue is, what prejudice, if any, have the Defence suffered by this unfortunate mix-up.Now, one matter is the question of notice. Have they received adequate notice of the allegations being made by this witness? That has to be answered in the affirmative. Clearly in the pre-trial brief, the disclosure does contain the evidence of the witness, and that has not changed in any manner or form.What is in issue here is the identity of the witness, and, of course, they do have legitimate rights. And the Accused has a legitimate right under Rule 20, to know who his accusers are. The issue is, have they suffered any prejudice at this stage, not knowing before Friday for sure, what the name of this witness was? They certainly have a right under Rule 66, which we certainly concede, and we did make disclosure to them well in advance under the requirements of that Rule. There was no deliberate attempt to hide the identity of the witness. It was an honest mistake, and the investigators are here to explain it. Now, if they have suffered any prejudice, then the Chamber is at liberty at any stage to recall the witness if indeed any sort of allegations arise following his testimony here to put those allegations to him.I did point out when this issue arose that I personally am very embarrassed at the developments, but this is the situation and I would offer the investigators who took the statement to address the Trial Chamber so that you can make your own assessment of whether or not this was a genuine mistake or a deliberate one on the part of the Prosecutor. Those are my submissions.And then in relation to the statements that have been handed out, there are two separate -- it's not correct for me to say there are two separate people with the same identity, it is just one person, and it is this witness with the statement dated 2nd June 2001 that is responsible for the mix-up in the first place, and you will hear it more directly from the investigators. It was the witness with the statement dated June 2001 that the investigators went to interview in the first place. However, they interviewed somebody else because he was not available, but they had anticipated meeting him and had entered the name prior to the commencement of the interview on their computer, and they will testify as to how that happened.So, to answer my learned friend's question, it is not the same person; there is only one person by that name. He is the person whose statement is dated the 2nd of June 2001. We were not interested in calling that person. However, it was in attempt to locate the person dated -- the person with the statement dated 2nd of June that the mix-up arose in the first place. And that is the explanation. There are not two people, just one person.</p>

          <p>Yes. And, in fact, both the statement of the 4th of April 2001 and the statement of 2nd June 2001 contain then the wrong name?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>No. The statement of the 2nd of June 2001 belong -- contains the right name, that is the name and statement of the person who rightfully has that name. The problem is with the 4th of April 2001 statement, and the explanation is this: It was with a view to procuring the 2nd of June 2001 statement that the investigators went out into the field through an intermediary. Unfortunately, they were meant to meet him in April; he didn't turn up. Somebody else turned up instead. They took a statement thinking it was the 2nd of June man they were talking to. It turned out not to be, Your Honour, and we only realised that this year, four years after the fact.</p>

          <p>Mr. Prosecutor, the name mentioned at file No. 14, CGP and CGP2, they are one and the same person?</p>

        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>That is the confusion. It is my learned friend for the Defence that has called that person CGP2. He is not CGP anything, because he is not a witness in this case. Do you understand, Your Honour? We never gave him this pseudonym. As far as we are concerned, the pseudonym CGP applies to the name on the statement dated 23rd September 2003. However, it is misleading because my learned friend has called this other man as CGP2. There is no such person as CGP2. I guess he has just done that just to illustrate to Your Honour. I mean, it is not from us, it is from them.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>And then now when we look at this document dated the 23rd of September 2003, there is a person identified. What about that name then?</p>

        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>That is CGP -- CGP, that is the name of CGP. That is CGP, that is his identity -- those are his particulars.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Yes. And that is what I meant. So the real person, CGP, the one who is being offered now as a Prosecution witness, that is the person under Arab <stage>(1)</stage> in 23rd September 2003. Is that correct?</p>

          <p>And then when we compare that to the names in the 4th of April statement and the 2nd of June statement, we see that the names in those two statements are the same, in other words, it is a different name, and it is the same name in both these statements.</p>

          <p>That is the first observation, and that observation is correct. Then, the second observation, Your Honour, and that based on your question, is that the details that are listed in paragraph 7 of the 4th of April 2001 statement should, in fact, have been the details listed in paragraph 7 of the 23rd September 2003 statement.</p>

          <p>Yes. There were three essential problems with that 4th of April statement, and I can take Your Honours through what the problems were.Paragraph one, the name is wrong. It should have been the name in paragraph 1 of September 2003. That is the first problem. However, having said that, if you look at the French version in your bundle of the 4th of April statement, you will see that it has the same nickname as the same nickname listed under 23rd September 2003.</p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>That is the first observation. Now, the second observation is paragraph 7 on the 4th of April statement, be it French or English, is incorrect -- it's incorrect. Those details belong to the real person and not the person on the 23rd September 2003. And again you can cross-check that, because if you look at the 2nd June statement, 2nd June 2001 statement, you will see that the place of birth coincides with that person. So what had happened there was that they had -- the investigators had some prior information before they met -- the investigators had some prior information to identify witnesses. That information consisted of name, place of birth. In anticipation of meeting the person that is indicated on the 4th of April 2001 statement, they, before the interview, filled in some of those columns. It is a pro-forma form on their computer. So in anticipation of the meeting, they filled in the name, the place of birth and all the things you see in paragraph 7. However, that person did not turn up, and someone else turned up instead. Also, someone they wanted to see, but not the person they were expecting at that time. Forgetting that they had entered column 1 and column 7, they just continued with the interview and entered column 2, 3, 4, 5, et cetera, and that is really where the confusion arose. They forgot to delete the name they had entered there before. That is why we have this problem.So paragraph 1, paragraph 7, are not correct on that statement, and also paragraph 13 is not correct. This man is not a member of that organisation in paragraph 13, but the real man is.</p>

The 2nd June -- there is no problem with the 2nd of June statement. It belongs to the man indicated on that statement and it is intended to be his statement. It has no bearing whatsoever here. The only problem is between the April and the 23rd September.</p>

          <p>But you see, the Bench also has to see this in the perspective of how this must have looked for the Defence, and the Defence was confronted with a situation where the names in the two documents were the same, namely, under Arab <stage>(1),</stage> and now I understand that the substance now on page 3 of this document of the 2nd of June 2001, is that right, that it belongs to that other person but not this witness that is now being offered?</p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>So that is why you are saying that page 3 is not really relevant or has no bearing, but it was disclosed as the other statement of this real CGP?</p>

        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>No, it wasn't, Your Honour. That is exactly why I say it is confusing. It was not disclosed that way. As far as we were concerned, up until last week, I would have sworn on oath that I had two witnesses with exactly the same name. That would have been my position. I had two witnesses in this case. Now, I only wanted to rely on one f them in trial, and that has been very clear to my learned friend for the Defence. Now, that is why I say the 2nd of June man is irrelevant, because I never indicated to him that I was calling the 2nd of June man. Even if they had the same name, assuming two witnesses have exactly the same name, but different particulars, I at some stage had made a choice between one and the other, and it was not the 2nd June.</p>

          <p>Now, there, there are two statements. One, dated 4th April 2001, and one 2nd of June 2001. That would seem to give the impression that there were two statements disclosed as being CGP statements.</p>

          <p>A very dreadful error which is terribly regretted. I haven't -- it is the first time I have seen that. But then, let us talk about this list. This is a list that was handed to my learned friend in the early days when the indictment was confirmed. This document must have been prepared by the people who handled the case before I did. But then in any event I see Your Honour's point that the way it is written -- and it is the first time I have seen this document, actually -- it looks as if the person CGP has two statements. It is indicated like there are two statements obtained from the same person. Well, it is understandable because, I mean, everybody at some stage thought that them having the same name, they were the same people, but having taken over the file we realised that they were two separate people, but we didn't actually realise there was even a further complication, that there was an error.So my learned friend is actually correct, in that at the time the disclosure was made to him, our office had indicated that CGP had two statements. That is wrong. That is not so. That is regrettable.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>All right. But tell us, what you are saying is that when you look at the binder which you have been using in this trial, you only offered one document, and that was the 4th of April statement, and that is where the name is wrong, but where the substance is right?</p>

        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>In other words, between the time we had prepared this statement, this list, and disclosed it to my learned friend, and the time we had prepared the pre-trial brief in anticipation of this trial, we had realised that those two statements belonged to two separate people, and had therefore chosen to rely only on one of them which was the 4th of April 2001. We made that very clear, that we were relying only on one of them. I had no idea that he had been misled prior to then, that the same person had two statements, and now I understand why he keeps saying that CGP had two statements. Now I understand, I didn't understand that before.</p>

          <p>Yes. Now, I would like to hear your opinion on the following questions. Is article -- is Rule 73bis <stage>(E)</stage> applicable here, since, in fact, the name of the witness originally in the bundle and the name in the 4th of April statement is the name of a different witness? In other words, in your view is -- what you have to do now is to vary under 73bis <stage>(E)</stage> or is it your view that since the person has all the time been the same and it is only this unfortunate error in terms of the name, that you don't have to go the way of 73bis <stage>(E)</stage> ?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, I would argue on behalf of the office that the provisions of Rule 73bis <stage>(E)</stage> relates more to the substance of the testimony that is being adduced as opposed to the identity of the witness. The intention clearly there is to cater for events where you do want to add or vary the nature of the testimony. Well, testimonies are made by witnesses, they are made by bodies. Certainly, the intentions of the people who drafted 73bis could not be to cater for the bodies minus the testimony. What we have here is different. We have the testimony being for the most part consistent -- entirely consistent. There is, therefore, no prejudice, because notice of that testimony has been given way above schedule. The problem now is with the body -- the human body which I respectfully would submit, is not what Rule 73bis is trying to address.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>And when it comes to your argument about prejudice, the fact that the Defence has been unable to investigate and prepare until the 26th of September, it is true that the Defence can always start investigations after the cross-examination. But still, how do you say that this is no prejudice?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, there is -- I can't say there is no prejudice. I mean, clearly there is an element of prejudice, because I accept that an accused person has the right to know those who accuse him. So I certainly cannot argue that there is no prejudice. But, can the prejudice be cured? I believe it can, Your Honour, and I believe that we can cure that if any material evidence comes to light by recalling the witness.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">

          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Mr. President I think the prejudice is irreparable -- incurable, because it is important for the Defence to have investigations before hearing the witnesses.Now, we have done this throughout the trial, and we have compared testimony of witnesses. We have looked at the recognition of the Accused by the witness. If we don't know the name or the address of the witness, how are we going to question the witness under conditions which he got to know and recognise the Accused?We didn't have any verification which was possible to us. There are errors which are completely irreparable, particularly in the fact that in one situation the witness belongs to a political organisation and not the other. And therefore the cross-examination turns out today, the 29th of September 2003, practically impossible to carry out, given the error, even if it was an error committed in good faith by the Prosecutor.Therefore the Defence believes that this is an irreparable damage which has been caused, and the only solution would be not to admit any testimony from Witness CGP.</p>

        <stage>Court recessed from 1454H to 1530H)</stage>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Well, we took a moment to deliberate because this is an unusual situation. The Judges have reached the following conclusion.It follows from Rule 69, protection of victims and witnesses, that, subject to Rule 75, the identity of the victim or witnesses shall be disclosed within such time as determined by the Trial Chamber to allow adequate time for preparation of the Prosecution and the Defence. Moreover, we have a relevant provision in Rule 73bis, which provides in connection with a pre-trial conference that there will be a pre-trial brief; there will be a list of witnesses the Prosecutor intends to call, with the name or pseudonym of each witness; and that the Trial Chamber or the Judge may order the Prosecutor to provide the Trial Chamber with copies of written statements of each witness whom the Prosecutor intends to call to testify. Now, in conformity with the system, the bundle of witness statements was then provided both to the Defence and the Trial Chamber shortly before the trial started. As soon as the unredacted version of the witness statements were disclosed, the Defence must have been under the impression that Witness CGP had the name listed under No. 14 in the bundle, and that would be confirmed by looking at the statement itself. Moreover, in a previous list provided by a previous team within the Prosecution, it was stated that this witness, CGP, had not only the statement of 4th April 2001, which is the one reproduced in the bundle, but it also follows that there is a statement dated June 2001, and also in that statement the same name as No. 14 in the bundle was listed. So there were two documents, then, indicating the wrong name of the witness. In addition to this, as mentioned by Mr. Phillips, the location of the witness was wrong in the 4th April statement; in other words, his particulars as to his commune, cellule, secteur and so forth, which are important elements to identify the witness, were misleading. It is true that in that statement there was a reference to a nickname, but a mere reference to a nickname cannot replace the full name of a witness. Consequently, the Chamber has to conclude that the Defence has been unable to prepare for the preparation of this witness, and it was only in connection with the latter part of this trial when the mistake was discovered, and in particular on the 26th of September, when I understand that the real name was disclosed to the Defence. It was only on that occasion that the Defence was able to understand that this witness actually bore a quite different name. Now, this certainly constitutes prejudice to the Defence. The question is how grave it is; can it be cured? And it is true, as stated by the Prosecution, that the witness may be recalled and that further investigations may be carried out until the commencement of the Defence case. But we are now at the end of the Prosecution's case. We have heard virtually all the witnesses. It is obviously of interest to the Defence to know the identity of all the witnesses in order to compare their statements and also the testimony in order to check their credibility.So, therefore, we are of the opinion that we cannot now say that this prejudice can be cured. Consequently there is a breach of Rule 69 <stage>(C),</stage> and it would not be in conformity, in our view, to allow this witness, bearing in mind the provision of Article 20 paragraph 4 <stage>(b)</stage> of the Statute.Let me stress that it does not in any way imply any criticism against the Prosecution. The Prosecution did not know what was happening. This is a human error, a genuine mistake, but when it comes to balancing the interests against each other, the Chamber had to reach this conclusion. So, Witness CGP, with the right name, will then not be allowed to testify, and we do not see that there is any need to hear the two investigators. That is the ruling of the Chamber. Are there any other witnesses in the trial, Mr. Phillips? </p>

            <p>I am unable to tell the different makes of vehicles, but it was a vehicle with a long chassis. It was the kind of vehicle on which one normally mounts antennae.</p>

            <p>I really don't know how to differentiate makes of cars. All I noticed is that it was a long chassis vehicle. But it was sort of like a Pajero kind of vehicle, but it was not the same vehicle as those which transport merchandise, for instance. </p>

            <p>I'm quite sure that that was the use for those machetes because, first of all, Ndindabahizi said something. He asked them why they were not killing the Tutsis, why they were allowing them to go. That is why I was saying that there was no other use for those machetes except that of being used for killing. </p>

            <p>It was actually a small structure, a small kind of house. It wasn't a house as such. You need to make a distinction between normal houses and this little structure in which the attackers lived. </p>

            <p>Yes, it's for that reason, but I think that even if he had not given that amount of money to the people manning the roadblock they were linked by a bond of friendship. I think there must have been some kind of exchange between some of those people manning the roadblock, maybe an exchange of cattle or something like that. So he didn't need to offer that amount of money in order to obtain my release.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, since Defence did not know until now the charges brought against the witness in Rwanda, we believe it would be proper to obtain the criminal records of the witness. However, I don't know how we are going to proceed, how we are going to go about it. I don't if it's the Prosecutor or the Defence or the registry should be taking that initiative, but I shall leave it at that for now. We can bring it back. They are just thoughts that are coming into my mind. I have no clear idea how to deal with it, but I just want to mention it this evening so that we can possibly come back to it.</p>

            <p>And in the first sentence of your written statement dated November 2000, it is the second sentence, "In April 1994 and throughout the war, except for a few times when I hid to escape death, I remained in my commune of origin." Am I to understand from that that you left your commune of origin to hide or did you mean something else? May I repeat the question, Witness?</p>

            <p>But the question is that in your written statement, I understand that you left your commune to hide, whereas you are saying today that you never left your commune. I therefore realise that there are two different things. Which one is correct? Just hang on a minute, let me finish with my question. Have you understood my question?</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Defence counsel gets that from the statement you gave to investigators. Do you understand where the investigators got that from?</p>

            <p>Yes. You did say in your examination-in-chief that you knew them all, but you mentioned only these names, whereas you say that they -- those who manned the Gaseke roadblock were 20, in your written statement. Do you remember other names of these people?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>I told you they were many and that I was only to recall the names that I have given you. I gave you three names, but you will understand that a roadblock is not manned by just three people.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>It is not true that I gave that number in my testimony here. I think I mentioned 20 people in my written statement, but I'm not saying that that is the absolute truth. I mentioned the name of some of these people, and regarding the number of people that I mentioned, it was just an estimate.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>You are asking if they were carrying weapons? Well, I saw only one person among them who was carrying a spear. The other weapons were the machetes that were given to them at that roadblock. That is what I managed to see.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>Possibly they could have been carrying weapons but I did not see them.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, what do you want me to tell you? I have told you that even if the attackers were not carrying weapons they can kill through their mere presence given the furore in them. But I am saying that the only person I saw carrying a weapon was the one carrying the spear.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Witness, Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, when he came to the roadblock, as you claimed, did he really say that, "There are a lot of Tutsis going through here, why don't you kill them?" Did he say that?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>He added the following: "Why do these people -- Tutsis go without being harassed?" I think he himself is aware of this unless he is trying to be smart.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">

            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>I am unable to tell you if he met some but I can tell that you Tutsis were killed at that roadblock. Maybe he got it wrong or he got to know that Tutsis were able to go through without being harassed, but what I'm telling you is what he said and which I'm recounting.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, don't you find it strange that the Tutsis <stage>(sic)</stage> who were at the roadblock did not immediately point you out to Ndindabahizi as being their most recent discovery of a Tutsi and did not try killing you immediately in the presence of Ndindabahizi?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>You find that strange? But I told that you that from among those manning the roadblock there was one influential person and that a message was sent to that person and they knew that that person was coming to release me -- or to free me from that roadblock. That is why those manning the roadblock did not harass me.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, if I should go over what you said in examination-in-chief, they arrested you, took you to the roadblock and you stayed at the roadblock for just a few minutes, then you see Emmanuel Ndindabahizi arrive and he stayed for just a brief moment. Within that short period you are saying that somebody circulated the information to the effect that you would be saved and at that very time the minister comes to the site. Is that what you want the Court to believe?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>There were even screams or shouts that I had been arrested, and that person heard that I was at the roadblock and he sent a message to say that, "Don't kill my son". He was somebody who was very -- who was well listened to by the people mounting the roadblock, and that is how come I was saved.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>In my language what I said, it wasn't only one, it could be one or many, and now you are clarifying that it could be many. All right.Now, how are you then able to remember that this happened particularly on the 20th of May, this event, after having stayed about for four weeks hiding in the bush? </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>When one goes into hiding, that doesn't mean that one loses one's mental capacities. I cannot forget that date. It's true that I was living in the bush, but I had contact with the outside world, and I must tell you that there were obviously bad people in 1994, but there were also people who were good.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>In the beginning of the testimony you said that you were not certain about the date; later in your testimony you said, "I can never forget that date". Can you explain those two remarks for me? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>It's a fact, the memory of an individual retains certain facts and forgets others. I think that this is a normal process when we are dealing with retention of information.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Witness, one of your first remarks in the testimony you gave today was, "I may be wrong about the date", and later you said "I'm absolutely certain about the date". That is what I want to put to you now: what is your answer now? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>The explanation I can make is that when you have students in a class, there are some who will have a good memory and others who have poor memory, who do not retain what they are being taught, and if you are being taught a hundred lessons, you can, for instance, maybe only remember one lesson.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Around '91-'92 you saw Mr. Ndindabahizi, you were still a child, you saw him from a distance. Do you remember telling us that? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, but obviously it was a distance which was not very far.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So what kind of distances are we talking about here? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>You see, you can take as a point of reference a road used by vehicles. You know that vehicles are parked to one side of the road. Now, put yourself in the place of someone who would be standing by the road on the opposite side of the place where the vehicles are parked. That's where I was.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So did you see him always in a vehicle or outside the vehicle? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>I wouldn't be able to tell you that he was outside the vehicle. In fact, I could say that he never left the vehicle, but it's true that when he came to visit his sister, he came out of the vehicle and he would go to see his sister, and after the visit he would go back to the vehicle and leave.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>And when you observed him, did you see him when he was in the vehicle or when he went out of it to visit his sister? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>I am unable to be more specific about that. I cannot -- I can tell you that I saw him when he was walking, going towards the sister's house. In fact, as far as I know, he didn't go to the sister's house because the road was quite steep and he would park by the road, and I think he never went to that house because he could never have gotten there on foot. The place was steep, and I don't think he could have reached the house.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So did you see him leave the vehicle on his way to his sister's house or did you not? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>No. No, I never saw him go up that walk in order to reach his sister's house. Maybe he would go there at times when I didn't see him, but personally I never saw him actually making that trip.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So you only observed him while he was inside the car; is that your testimony? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, it was only on those occasions that I would see him, only then. Maybe he did indeed go to his sister's house, but I cannot confirm that because I never saw him walk towards his sister's house. I can therefore not testify to something of which I was not a witness.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, how can you be certain that the man you saw in '95 was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, when in '91-'92 on a limited number of occasions you had only seen Emmanuel Ndindabahizi inside the car? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>I can confirm that, and I have no doubt whatsoever about that, because, firstly, in other words, in 1992, it was said, "The brother of one such lady has come", his name would be mentioned by the people, and then on the 20th of May, 1994 some people who were at the roadblock asked who was that personality and his name was mentioned. People were asking questions about where that man was working, and these people were saying amongst themselves that "He is now minister for finance", and it was at that point in time that I realised that it was Emmanuel Ndindabahizi they were talking about.Now, as for the occasions during which I had seen him earlier, I had seen him two or three times, so when I saw him at the roadblock it wasn't the first time I was seeing him.</p>

            <p>Well, we have one contentious matter as things stand, and that is very important to us. It is the 3rd May meeting, I believe, and that is very contentious. That is a major part of the Prosecution's case, and it is a Prosecution exhibit that is very important, so unless we have some way forward with that, it is very difficult for us to actually make a decision as to whether we are able to close our case at this stage or not, Your Honour. It is an exhibit that cannot really be entered outside the Prosecution's case. It can't.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, but is there any other problematic issue than the 3rd of May? </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>No, it is the only one outstanding, to the best of my knowledge, as far as our case is concerned. For the Defence case, I have no knowledge as of now what the issues are.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>When do you think, Defence, that you will be able to clarify the issue about the 3rd of May? Can that be done tomorrow? </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>With the cooperation of the registry it would certainly be able to be done during tomorrow. I know that we have in the Niyitegeka case a transcript in French, in Kinyarwanda and in English of that document. If I can consult that document tomorrow morning, I think towards the end of the morning or in the afternoon I would be able to express myself on these transcripts with regard to what the Prosecution is saying about the same.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">

          <p>Good afternoon. Now, let us start in an open session to deal with the public matters, namely, whether there is anything to be said about the last exhibit and possibly to hear any announcement once the exhibit issue has been sorted out.So who will start on this issue about the exhibit? </p>

        <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Good evening, Your Honours. We just renew our application to enter this 3rd May document as a Prosecution exhibit in connection with the testimony of Madam Alison Des Forges. The -- if we revisit, my learned friend certainly has not made any -- has not laid any foundational basis for which this document should not be admitted in evidence. The only observation that I recall him making was the notations on the English translation on pages -- page 25, namely, number 11, and the notation there that that person listed there is in Kibuye prison, and also on page 26 where the bourgmestre is also listed as being in Kibuye prison. And he says, well, they were not in Kibuye prison when this document -- when these minutes were taken, so where did those notations come from? And therefore, the document is, for the most part, unreliable.Now, in response, our submissions are as follows: First of all, it is the Kinyarwanda translation under tab 1 that is the operative document. The notations that my learned friend talks about concerning number 11 and number 26 actually exist in the Kinyarwanda translation. And I have only just found out this evening that if you look at the list of those who attended the meeting, there are two separate copies of the first page. In other words, list number 1 to 43, there are two copies of it with two separate tab numbers. So if you look under tab 1 where the list of those who attended, K0248675 is one list, and if you flip over, K0248676 is exactly the same list. The only difference is that 675 has handwritten notations against certain names. If you look at 11, there's an underline there with "prison, Kibuye" written; 15, "deporté"; 26, "prison, Kibuye," and so forth. Now, it's very obvious that whoever then did the subsequent translation from Kinyarwanda into English just translated those words that were written. And that's the explanation for why, in the typed version under tab 3, you then have the extra notations there that say "Kibuye prison," et cetera, in brackets. That's where they got it from. And I actually didn't realise that this document was in the bundle at the time, but I've just seen that some commentaries have been made. Therefore, the very essence of the challenge is defeated. There's no -- nothing to suggest that this document has been tampered with. As to the chain of custody, well, it's obvious from the reading of tab 1 that these were minutes of the meeting taken by the préfet and forwarded by the préfet to the minister of the interior, or whoever it was forwarded to, and there is a covering letter at the beginning of tab 1 to that effect. The document originates from the evidence unit of the Tribunal, of the Office of the Prosecutor. It's been serialed <stage>(sic),</stage> and there is no impropriety in relation to the documents whatsoever.The 3rd May meeting have been used in a variety of cases in this Tribunal, especially the Kayishema trial, and I'm sure that this matter was raised or this document was brought to their attention. If it wasn't, it doesn't depart, anyway, from the veracity of the contents of this statement. And I would be very eager to see what my learned friend has to say following my submissions. I'm grateful.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Thank you.Defence. </p>

        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. President. The Defence is not against having this document admitted as a Prosecution document, but I think we can deal with this rather quickly. I would wish that the Tribunal can take note of the reservations which I have expressed. My main reservation is that we are not formally contesting or challenging the authenticity of the document but its reliability. We know that this document was drawn up by a préfet, Kayishema, or his secretary maybe several weeks after the meeting was held, and we are wondering about the sources available to the préfet or his secretary to enable him to write this document. Was it from memory or was it from a private recording or was it from notes which were taken during the meeting? We do not know. Consequently, we are insisting on the fact that we do not know how this document is a reflection of what was said during the meeting.If these words I have said are taken into due account by the Chamber, I would not be against this document being admitted as an exhibit for the Prosecution. Furthermore, I have here today, thanks to the registry, Exhibit P5 -- P5, I repeat -- which was filed in the Niyitegeka case. It's an exhibit from the Office of the Prosecutor which constitutes the transcripts of a cassette which was, itself, a recording of a broadcast of Radio Rwanda during that famous meeting of the 3rd of May. So here we have the transcripts which are quite different, in fact, from the document issued by the Prosecutor. It's different in its form and in substance. I think the Chamber should have these two documents which may supplement one another. Let me underline the fact that it has been indicated that this document, in other words, the transcripts of the cassette from Radio Rwanda, was somewhat incomplete.I am now requesting that this document, which is available to the Tribunal in English, be also admitted as a Defence exhibit and therefore be -- the Chamber will have at its disposal the two documents, and they will be available for any assessment necessary when we come to closing arguments. I thank you.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Thank you for placing this on record, Mr. Besnier. So the Chamber has noted your remarks in relation to the interview, and you will, of course, in addition, be free to address this when we come to the merits and the closing arguments. So that's noted.We will then enter this as P26. Is that so, registry? Thirty? P30, that's where we are now. All right, P30.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>And then we had the issue of the transcripts. Do you have the document made available to all of us here? Mr. Phillips, any comments on that, please?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, we have a preliminary objection to these transcripts being entered. First of all, as a matter of procedure, I don't see the basis for my learned friend entering transcripts, wherever they have been derived from. There's no witness in the box. There's no foundational basis for entering those transcripts, and he can't seek to enter transcripts in limbo. The right procedure would have been to enter the transcripts when Alison Des Forges was there and give her a chance to comment on the transcripts. We gave Alison Des Forges a chance to comment on the 3rd May meeting documents. Now there is no witness in the box, and we're now entering transcripts in limbo. I mean, that's something that I have great problems with. That's the first thing.The second thing is the representation to Your Honours that they're transcripts. They may well be transcripts, but they're not a contemporaneous record. They're not a contemporaneous record of the proceedings on the day. Rather, what my learned friend seeks to enter, and refers to as transcripts, are bits from a news broadcast following the meeting of 3rd May where reference is made to various speeches that are made there. So it's news broadcast on Radio Rwanda which was recorded, and the transcripts are derived therefrom. So it's a different thing to have a recording of a live broadcast, which is a contemporaneous broadcast, it's a different thing to have a reporter reporting on what may have happened and summarising what took place. So that's the nature of the document, because I'm very familiar with the document that he talks about. But well apart from that, it's the evidential basis and the procedural difficulties in entering documents into evidence without actually having somebody giving someone the benefit to comment on those documents. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Could we have your comments on those two matters, please, Mr. Besnier. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Mr. President. I don't see why that shouldn't be done, because this matter came up after Mrs. Alison Des Forges testified. That's when the document was filed. It was after that that we questioned its reliability, and we were able to carry out research investigations to verify and obtain, with the assistance of the registry, the document in question.Secondly, I believe that the Tribunal is free to admit as an exhibit anything which could help us find the truth at the appropriate moment, and this is why the -- it's because the Prosecution provided evidence that we are providing evidence which will supplement that which is already on the table. And I think it is a good idea for the Chamber to have the two documents.Finally, the Prosecutor and the Defence will be able to argue on the reliability and the authenticity of these documents in their closing arguments. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Besnier, do you have any Defence witness testifying about the 3rd of May? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Truly speaking, no, Mr. President. As matters stand, given my list of witnesses, I don't have a witness which will -- who will testify on that meeting of the 3rd May. Let me remind the Tribunal that this meeting of the 3rd of May is not part of the indictment, and it -- it's not a document in dispute, given what is available in the Ndindabahizi case file. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Phillips is right that this is a slightly unusual situation. On the other hand, this unusual situation came up because there was discussion about these minutes at a very late stage in connection with Alison Des Forges's testimony. The issue of the minutes was raised just before her testimony in the witness stand, and then the Defence said that they would come back and, after inquiries with the registry, look into the matter.Now, this is a matter -- the transcripts have been tendered in previous trials. Even if there is no -- the witness Alison Des Forges was not given the possibility to comment directly on this, that is due to the particular sequence which we have outlined now. It was only later that this -- rather late that this came up. So we will, in the interest of fairness, receive both, then P30, as we have accepted from the Prosecution, and these transcripts, which we will now receive from the Defence, it being understood that in relation to both documents, the parties will be free to address us on the reliability of these documents. The Defence asked us some time ago to exercise caution in relation to the -- with the minutes. Mr. Phillips just asked us or drew our attention to the fact that this may be rudimentary and not complete, and that they are news reports. But all this we will come back to on the merits stage.So then it's also admitted as an exhibit, namely, D17. Now, is this both transcripts and tape? Are we talking about two different -- are we talking about A exhibit being the transcripts and then B exhibit being the tape or vice versa, or are we talking about only one exhibit? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>For the time being, I only have the document, the hard copy, in English. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Right. So, then, the right sequence would be, then, P -- did you say 17, registry? D17. Now, D17A will be the sound version, if it's ever found; D17B will be the transcript in French; and D17C will be the transcript in English. So that would clear the matter.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Another observation in relation to the witness Your Honours heard yesterday, Witness -- I'm just trying to find -- CGC. I've heard mention being made of obtaining the criminal antecedents of this witness. Whilst I don't have any objection to that, and neither does the witness, I would ask that the witness be recalled if those antecedents are going to be made use of during the deliberation so that he's given an opportunity to comment on the document. So in other words, if we are going to obtain documents concerning this witness, then in essence we are going to have to make provision to recall that witness, have that document put to him, and give him and afford him an opportunity to comment on the contents of that document, if any reference is going to be made to that document in these proceedings. So that's, that's the first observation.In that case, because he's a Prosecution witness, then that leaves us with the practical problem of whether or not we're able to close our case if we are still recalling Prosecution witnesses, and I'm in Your Honours' hands in relation to that, but that's a procedural matter that we have to bring to your attention at this stage, Your Honour, and -- yeah. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. You will, of course, be free to raise this issue should this document ever appear, and you will then ask a request -- request the Chamber to call this document, and maybe a practical way to do this would be that you could do it in terms of a possible rebuttal. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>It wouldn't strictly be a rebuttal witness, especially if -- I mean, strictly speaking, it wouldn't be a rebuttal witness because rebuttal testimony has to be limited to matters raised in the Defence case, and if there's nothing to rebut, it's just a question of --</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>No. But I'm envisaging a situation where the Defence will receive these documents -</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>-- and then tries to use them and show that the witness is not credible, and that's where you will come back and say, listen, this is not a good argument because the witness was never really given the opportunity to comment upon this document, and in that perspective, it is some kind of a rebuttal. So we can do this two ways: Either call it rebuttal, or you can close your case subject to the issue of recalling that witness. These are the two ways to do it. I think I'll leave that, actually, to the discretion of the Prosecution.</p>

During those 11 days, until yesterday, we had heard 15 witnesses for the Prosecution, and this marks the end of the Prosecution case, and we will then resume at a date to be decided after consultation with the parties to hear the Defence case.So thank you to both parties for their expediency, and now the Prosecution case has come to an end, and we will go from an open to a closed session. Thank you very much. And I think maybe I would say, I think the parties -- but actually, it's the Prosecution witnesses, so you, Prosecution, you presented the 15 witnesses in 11 days, and I think that's very efficient.</p>

This sentence is not from survivors or from history books; it was said at 25th October, last 25th October, by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi when I visited him at the detention centre. In April, May and June 1994, death lurked in the hills of Kibuye. Yet all the Hutus did not become demons, even if all the Tutsis were potential victims. Several Hutus themselves fell under the true barbarism, others did the best they could under the circumstances to save lives, to preserve their dignity or simply to protect their family. It is one of the tasks of the Defence before this Court to demonstrate that the Accused was one of those who went through hell without losing their dignity, those who faced up to their responsibilities, these civil servants who remained at their posts to ensure the survival of the state, without their work, meaning their support for killings, without their signature at the bottom of an administrative document, meaning their signing up to a crime. Defence is not obligated to supply evidence; in law, it should simply draw the attention of the Judges to the doubts which attend the demonstration of the Prosecutor, and we believe that at this very stage, the charges brought against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi are not solid and true. But in the case at bar, the Defence will go beyond refuting the evidence of the Prosecutor. We on this side of the courtroom are not afraid to face up to the facts. And let's keep to the facts. It is a judicially -- judicially proven truth, since the judgement of this Tribunal on 21st May 1999, in the Kayishema case, that tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed in the Kibuye préfecture. It is a fact, judicially proven, that a great number of them were collectively killed at the Gatwaro stadium on the 18th April 1994. It is also a fact, judicially proven, that several survivors took refuge in the Bisesero region and were massively exterminated, particularly on the 13th and 14th May 1994. The suspects of these killings were sought and arrested by the Rwandan authorities as well as the Prosecutor of the ICTR. Some were sentenced. The judicial records of these proceedings cover several thousands of pages, witnesses were heard for hundreds of hours, and in the ICTR, five judgments have been rendered, covering more than 800 detailed information on the Kibuye killings. But is it not strange that the name of Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel, never appeared in these proceedings, not in Rwanda and not in the ICTR? In the case that I referred to, more than 100 Prosecution witnesses were called, and they testified against a number of people, outside the Accused, but never this man. Dozens of businessmen, bourgmestres, low-level civil servants, were accused and names were revealed, their roles were specified in the case of this event, and never was the name of the Minister of Finance mentioned. Is it not strange that while -- that according to the Prosecutor, his presence alone will amount to incitement to kill? Is it not also -- does this not cast doubt on the fact that -- is there not doubt in the fact that this man was accused only seven years after the events, whereas he was regularly in contact, and for several years, with the investigators of the Prosecutor? Is it not curious to see the Prosecutor, a few weeks before the trial, divest Ndindabahizi of his political position and to retain against him the simple crime of individual responsibility? Is it not surprising that observers, experts, historians, specialists of genocide and human rights, never mentioned the name of Ndindabahizi, never write his name, whereas they do not -- they always mention individuals whose functions were less important than his? Even Madam Alison Des Forges, who did not honestly answer the only question I put to her, never wrote the name of the Accused, never once, not even once, in her book, which is an authority, "Leave None to Tell the Story." Are these not objective elements of doubt, even before we start examining the evidence of the Prosecutor, which we are going to be doing at another stage? In Rwanda, on the crime sites, names -- which the names are familiar to you -- Gasharu, Gitaka, Gitwa -- nobody accuses Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. Preliminary reports on the massacres perpetrated in Kibuye, the first of which was published in 1996 by the Rwandan minister of higher education, does not mention his name anywhere, whereas dozens of suspects are mentioned. On the hills, nobody does not take serious these charges brought against him, and I do not think that the witnesses or the Prosecutor themselves believe in that. You don't have to limit yourselves to my assertions. The witnesses, our witnesses, in the days ahead are going to be called before you. The first batch of them are mainly Tutsis, genocide survivors. Their names or their parents' names are known to you. They are sons and daughters of persons who have been assassinated and who Prosecution witnesses have already made mention to. You will then be able to finally put faces to the victims. Before you, and before the Accused, these people, whose families sometimes have been killed, will tell you what they think about the charges brought against Ndindabahizi. Other witnesses are well-placed to know the truth. They themselves are the killers. Most of them have pleaded guilty. I pray the Court to allow me to bring this evidence before you, because sometimes the recounting of these facts are difficult, but it is a necessary state to finding the truth. In April, May, June 1994, death was in the hills of Kibuye, and I did not see the face of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi there. Thank you, Mr. President. </p>

          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Besnier. I have two questions for you in light of your opening statement. The first question relates to the matter that none of the witnesses in previous cases have referred to Mr. Ndindabahizi. That sentence, does that refer to the finding in the five judgments which you referred to, namely, the Kibuye judgements, or does that statement refer to their testimony also in the transcripts? That's one question. And the second question was your reference to Alison Des Forges. There you said that Mr. Ndindabahizi's name does not figure in her book. Her answer was that it didn't figure in the registry, in the registry of the book, in the index, but that she wanted to reserve her position because there may be mistakes in the index. So your statement, does that imply that you have checked the book itself and that you have not found any reference to Mr. Ndindabahizi? </p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Yes, Mr. President. On the first issue, we have carefully examined judgements which have been rendered in the case of Kibuye and we realise that Ndindabahizi's name never appeared in these judgments. We then looked at the transcripts, and witness statements. I'm not asserting that we have absolutely checked all the transcripts of the testimony of witnesses. We have gone through some of them and I believe that should account for about half of the testimony, and I'm sure the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein. Regarding the second question, Mr. President, we have also carefully examined the totality of Madam Alison Des Forges's book and not only the index, and I can assure you that the name of Ndindabahizi does not appear therein, not even when the expert is talking about the formation of the interim government. </p>

          <p>Your Honour, so far as the judgement <stage>(sic)</stage> is concerned, there is something concerning Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence that I should like to mention. As far as that witness is concerned, she will talk about things that occurred in a small cellule of the Kibuye préfecture. It's a cellule where she always lived in, and she lives there still, and it's a location of crimes described in the indictment. Now, the person we are referring to could be easily identified. That person is one of the survivors, and there are not many survivors from that préfecture -- from that cellule, but I do remember that the Prosecutor, on the basis of these very same circumstances, had applied for a sitting in camera, which was granted. I shall therefore question the witness concerning the location at which the witness was, and probably these questions may reveal the witness's identity, so that I will be compelled to apply for a sitting in camera for this particular witness as compared to the others. We shall try to limit ourselves in time to ensure that the sitting in camera is done properly, but I would not be able to assure you that we will exhaust all the questions in this sitting in camera, sir. </p>

So Registry, make sure that the public gallery is being closed. Thank you very much. </p>

It was from that day that they started killing the Tutsi. It is to tell you that all the Tutsis were not hiding at that time.

            <p>That is due to the fact that when we are in our various cellules, we talk. We talk about names of persons that killed other people during the events and names of victims for the purpose of reassuring ourselves as to what -- as to whether what we say about the responsibilities of such and such a leader is true or not, because some of the attackers are now in prison or at the time were in prison.

            <p>I have another question. You stated that you had two hiding places, in the ceiling and in the garden, and that you left one, the first one in June after Accused's visit and the second in July, is that what you said?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>After his departure, I left my first hiding place and I went to the house, and nobody came into the house to look for anybody after that. He had already made the statement and after his departure, we couldn't have been absolutely sure that we were safe. We could not therefore go out, but what is certain is that after his departure, nobody went around seeking people out in houses any more. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-cgc">
            <speaker>WITNESS CGC:</speaker>
            <p>Well, let me explain. I didn't go hiding in the ceiling; I was in the house. I could move around the house but I did not go out of the house. I went out of the house and remained in the compound. I remained in the compound. I never went outside the compound, and after that, I no longer hid in the ceiling as was the case before. </p>

            <p>So you are simply asking for about ten minutes. Any problems with that, Prosecution? No.And we have to grant that motion, but the public will note then that in about ten minutes we will revert to the open session. And the purpose of this closed session is simply to protect the identity of this witness. Thank you very much. </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>I have three more questions for you, Mr. Witness. Witness, did the investigators of the Prosecutor contact you after the genocide to find out from you the conditions under which your father died?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, they contacted me.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>And did you tell them the same thing as what you said before this court?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that is what I told them.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Have you ever been called as a Prosecution witness in any trial in Rwanda?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, on one occasion I was called to testify against someone.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>And that occasion you are referring to, did it have anything to do with the killing of your father?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. Questions were put to us on the killing of our father, and on that occasion we went to Kibuye.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>In that case in Rwanda, the case you are referring to, did the name of Ndindabahizi come up?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>No, the name of Ndindabahizi was not mentioned during that trial.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Witness, you are a Tutsi, aren't you?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I am.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Do you know Emmanuel Ndindabahizi here present is accused of having very important share of the responsibility in the killing of your father? Are you aware of this?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>That is not true. I cannot come to testify in favour of somebody who killed my father. It is obvious -- it's not possible that anyone would testify in favour of the person who murdered his father. It's not possible.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Would it not be possible, Witness, that the Accused did this without your knowledge by inciting other people to do this without you knowing?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>I would have known in any event, because Ndindabahizi has good relations with people and I would have known anyhow.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Look me in the eyes, Witness, are you sure that Ndindabahizi had no hand in the killing of your father? Have you conducted your investigations, and you can say with a clear conscience that you know Ndindabahizi had no hand in the killing of your father?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dh">
            <speaker>WITNESS DH:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, absolutely. What I have said is the truth, Ndindabahizi played no role whatsoever in the death of my father. He did not take part in the killing of my father because he was not present. </p>

            <p>The information in your statement is a little bit more intriguing, Mr. Witness, because in your statement, you state clearly that you have no specific information to give about the owner of house No. 1.

            <p>Isn't it not the case, Mr. Witness, that the reason why you brought up staying in house No. 1 is because you know that that's where Tatiana stayed and you want us to believe that you know about Tatiana and what happened to her, is that not true, Mr. Witness?</p>

            <p>So your brother and yourself were taken to the Gitaka village centre -- I'm trying to reconstitute the events -- this is after you were flushed out of your hiding place, then comes in what you just told us about regarding how your brother was killed.

            <p>They arrested my brother but I was able to escape from them. But later on I said to myself that it would be better for me to go and look for him. And on my way I met a group of assailants who also took me to Gitaka centre. And it was at that point in time that Karara gave money to the leader of the attackers. They released me, and they said they were going to come back for me the following day to kill me but they didn't do so. </p>

            <p>Madam Witness, your conviction of the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi during the genocide, Prosecutor is trying to link that to the fact that the <stage>(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal)</stage> of Ndindabahizi gave you shelter. Will this conviction not, rather, flow from the totality of the information that you were able to gather on the conduct of Mr. Ndindabahizi, on information that you got, research that you conducted, which enabled you to assert that we're all victims of this genocide? We're in a better position to know the perpetrators, and I can assure that you Mr. Ndindabahizi is not one of them. Is this conviction this, and not a way of saying thank you, as it is being inferred?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-di">
            <speaker>WITNESS DI:</speaker>
            <p>It is not because somebody gave me shelter, who is related to him. I'm saying this because when he came he was very shocked by the killing of the people, and he was very angry. And they showed him one person who had killed a lot of people and he asked that person to be arrested, but that person fled. But subsequently he had Karara arrested, had him detain. But for me, this is evidence that Mr. Ndindabahizi did not have any responsibility in the genocide.</p>

            <p>This will bring us to the end of the day also. And tomorrow, Defence, we start with DL? </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, in fact, Mr. President, I'm in a position to give some information to the Court on the proceedings. We currently have 13 witnesses here in Arusha. We have called four. Things are moving very fast and that's very good. Out of the 13 witnesses, we have seen and prepared eight. The Defence team has not yet met the remaining five. Other witnesses should be arriving at the end of the week, and the expert can come here only from the 17th of November. If tomorrow we are able to hear four witnesses, we would have heard all the witnesses that we've prepare, and we would need a day or two to meet the remaining witnesses. Therefore, I think that if we are able to hear four witnesses tomorrow, to adjourn for a day or two, or a day and a half, to enable us to meet other witnesses so that before the end of the week we could hear other witnesses. Today, I can say that we'll be able to hear ten witnesses in the course of the week. It is possible that we would need a day of Thursday, Wednesday or Thursday, to be able to prepare the witnesses that we intend to hear on Friday. Will this be agreeable to the Court?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Well, if you do not have more witnesses, there is no choice. But as I indicated previously, this is exactly the situation that the Court would wish to prefer -- to avoid. Now, but what we note now is that we have four witnesses for tomorrow, and that is very well and good, and then let's see how it proceeds from then. But I'm a bit worried about next week. How many witnesses do you have for next week? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>The week after, it would depend on how many witnesses we are able to call this week. We are going to call Witnesses 9, 14, 15, 16, and 17, plus possibly some witnesses who are already here that we have not yet heard. But here I would not like to make any pronouncements on that. In any event, Mr. President, we have sufficient witnesses for next week.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>All right. So that's where we are now. Thank you very much for that clarification. And, tomorrow, could you just indicate the order for the four witnesses, tomorrow. Will you do that, please, the ones you have already had occasion to interview, please. </p>

            <p>With the exception of one day when the minister came to our cellule -- he's a native of that cellule -- when he came he realised that members of his family had been killed. He realised that his cousins had been killed and he got enraged, and he thought that perhaps I was one of the killers of his cousins. He wanted to arrest one of the murderers who fled, and he said, "I will arrest you. I will arrest you because I am not sure of your behaviour. I will take you back to the commune so that you explain what happened, because you were there." He took me to the commune and when we got to the communal office I spent a night in the communal cell, but I didn't have any problems. It was a matter of making investigations to ensure whether or not I was one of the murderers. And when he realised that I didn't participate in the killings, and that, rather, I tried to save a child from his own family, because it was the child of his cousin, I was released the next day. In the morning I went back home. </p>

            <p>No. When they took him away there was a good person who came and told me that, "Your boss has been arrested. He's been taken to the Buye secteur." There was a young girl that I was hiding, and when they took him they said, "These same people will come for the girl and kill her along -- together with Cyprien." I could not defend her. I run, took the girl and hid her elsewhere, and when they came to my house to look for her, they could not find her because I had taken her elsewhere. That was the only person that I could save.

            <p>No, but I saw Évareste take Karegeya away, and I believe he is the one responsible for his death, because he took him away to be killed.

            <p>He did nothing else. He got angry and told me, "You have to give some explanations and say how these people died, because they were your neighbours." We could see that he was very angry. You cannot get to a place, realise that your relatives had been killed and not get angry, and you say that the person who was present should explain the death of these people. So he was furious, but we understand his fury. You yourself would have had the same reaction if your relatives were exterminated. When you go to the site where they were exterminated, I believe you would have reacted in the same manner. Subsequently, he conducted an investigation and realised that I was not involved in the death of his relatives, and that's how come I was released. </p>

            <p>It was because I was living there. Most of the other people were just passing by; they were passers-by, and the other person had just fled.

            <p>Yes, the following day I was released. In fact, if I was arrested, it was to enable him to conduct his investigations for him to know if I knew how his relatives were killed. And I explained to him that I was able to save a child and that if we had the means -- if he had the means, he could take this child with him so that she's not killed. And when he heard that, indeed, I was hiding the child, and when he heard that the child was still alive, the following day I believe he ordered that I be released. A policeman came to tell me that I could go to him. I believe he was able to conduct his investigations. He found out that I was hiding the child, and so he sent a policeman to release me.</p>

            <p>The people came to greet him. Gatete did not know the minister and the minister did not know Gatete. But the minister asked, "Who ordered you to kill other people? Are you not ashamed to kill?" He told me, "I know you. You were a neighbour to my relatives, and you are going to explain to me how he was killed -- how they were killed." And people said, "This person is innocent. This is the guilty one; he is the one who killed the people. Gatete, Augustin, he is the one who killed a lot of people." When he heard that, when Gatete heard that, he fled immediately. He did not hail from that cellule. He went to his native Kayenzi secteur, and we did not see him again.</p>

            <p>So when your counsel -- when the Defence show in some documents that you were formally a responsable, they are not reflecting the truth of your position -- as regards your position; is that correct?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>I was a member of the cellule committee, but I was never a responsable of any cellule, so you need to make a distinction between a member of a cellule committee and a responsable of a cellule.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>My question was: If somebody showed that you were formally a responsable, they couldn't possibly be telling the truth?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, on the document mentioned that I was responsable de cellule, that wouldn't be correct.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Mr. Witness, as a member of the cellule, the committee of the cellule, it was part of their responsibilities to oversee security matters in the cellule; is that correct?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, but during the period in question, I was not a member of the cellule. Elections had been organised before the war, and I was no longer a member of the cellule committee.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>

            <p>As for the rest of the population, did you hold any -- did you conduct any night patrols because of the -- because of the war in April?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, we couldn't organise night patrols because there were thieves who came from more or less everywhere. Neighbours were trying to come together in order to protect the houses in their neighbourhood, but we didn't have any night patrols.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, there was no one really responsible as such. People could decide to remain by the house of one neighbour, maybe numbering five, and the next morning they would probably decide to go and spend the time next to someone else's house. This is because we didn't have enough means to ensure our protection. It's more by the grace of God that people were able to survive and protect their property.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>It's the Tutsis who were being attacked.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>It's because it is the Tutsis who were being pursued. They were the ones who were being sought.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>How do you want me to know that? Violence took place everywhere in the country. Sometimes you were told it's the Tutsis who were the target of the attacks, but I cannot tell you that it was for this or that reason. It was just bad chance which was -- it was just a curse which was playing in -- against the Tutsi.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>So it's your testimony that it was because of the curse that the Hutu were seeking for the Tutsi?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, they were the attackers who were attacking the Tutsis. I would rather say that it was the Hutus who were cursed because they were unjustly attacking the Tutsis.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, did some Tutsis seek refuge at Kirambo church? Are you aware of that, Mr. Witness?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, there were Tutsis who took refuge in that church, but when the bourgmestre came to fetch them in order to take them to Kibuye, all he did was to take some of them. But when he went back, he realised that there wasn't any security, and he was unable to move the rest, the remaining Tutsis. Given that situation, the Tutsis dispersed. Some tried to go to Kibuye on foot, others were killed, but there were some who managed to reach Kibuye on foot.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Mr. Witness, how did the bourgmestre know that there were some people seeking refuge in Kirambo? Could you help us with that, please?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>There was a telephone line in that place. The bourgmestre was called by phone.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, did you also go to Kirambo, to Kirambo church at any time during the course of the war?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Mr. Witness was it -- is it not true that the roadblock was part of the security measures that was taken by the cellule leadership to protect itself against the attacks?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, roadblocks were erected in order to limit banditry. And when you approached a roadblock, you were asked to show your identity documents, and people tried to find out who you were. But let me tell you that the Tutsis were afraid. They couldn't go near anywhere where there were roadblocks.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

            <p>Mr. President, I don't know what my learned friend is talking about. I didn't see this document -- it is in Kinyarwanda -- before the trial. The Prosecutor is asking whether the witness was interrogated as a witness by the judicial police. I see here written minutes of the interview of the suspect. I think it is a trap for the witness, and they want to confuse him, but I should like a translation made to me so that --</p>

            <p>Yes, three things, Mr. President. Firstly, this document was not disclosed to the Defence. Secondly, it is in Kinyarwanda, and we don't understand it. And three, there is only one word in French in this document -- one sentence. This sentence is, "Minutes of the hearing of the suspect," whereas earlier on, the Prosecutor asked witness whether he was heard by the judicial police as a witness. Now, the witness different from the Accused. I think that the question was not properly put to the witness, and if we are to come back to this issue, we should ask witness whether he was heard in the past as an accused.</p>

Investigations were carried out, and when you were proven to be innocent, you were released. You talked to me about an IPJ, a Rwandan IPJ. I did not understand that you meant the IPJ of the commune.

            <p>Okay. Now, let's turn to the visit by -- the alleged visit by Mr. Ndindabahizi in your place. When do you place that visit? When did Mr. Ndindabahizi come to Gishaka -- to your place of --</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>He came at the beginning of June.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, it was not in May. When he came, a few days later we were in July. That's why I'm saying it was in June. Maybe it was towards the end of May.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, how did the people -- how did people know that Ndindabahizi had come to that area?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>It was a Sunday, and to go to his house you have to go through the centre. So people coming from church went through the centre and they were able to see him.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, when you say that people said you were responsible for the killings in that cellule, did the people raise up their hands and point you out, or how did Ndindabahizi get that kind of information?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>This was when people were appropriating other people's property. In those days people said, "You have killed somebody." And even if later on the person who is supposed to be the victim is seen alive, they have already taken your property and you have already been accused. So there were people who were killed even though they were innocent.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Let me tell you, Mr. Witness, what the problem Mr. Ndindabahizi found with you was that you were protecting Tutsis in your residence. What do you say to that?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, that was not the reason. It was, rather, because when he came, he found no member of his family who had survived.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>You were reputed to be protecting Tutsi, and that is Mr. Ndindabahizi ordered your arrest?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>He was investigating, and he thought I participated in the killing of his cousins. And if indeed I were guilty, I would not have been a free man, and I would not have lived in that place and -- I would not have lived in that place together with those who had lived there for years.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>You were also accused of stealing his land that is why he arrested you, his land and cows?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No. If I wanted to appropriate his land, I would have started by killing his child who was with me. How could I have appropriated his land when his child was still alive?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>And that is why when you went to Kibuye, you had rested there overnight and came back?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, because he realised that I was innocent. People can lie, but he examined the situation closely and realised that I was innocent. Even children knew how their cows were looted, who looted and under what circumstances.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Mr. Witness, you testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi came from the cellule in which you are residence, correct? And that he aware that in April and May, the war was raging on in his cellule of origin, correct?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, at the beginning of the month of May the war had ended; there were no more killings. When he came, there were no more killings.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Why do you think Ndindabahizi would wait for two months to come to his cellule of origin when he knew that he had Tutsis relatives and Tutsis were being killed in Rwanda? Why taking two months and not just a week or so if you are late?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>I think where he was he had friends and the situation was serious. Maybe he was taking care of his friends. I don't know what he was doing where he was because I was not there. I have no way of knowing.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>From my place to Kibuye is a long distance. Kibuye is a town. Even if it is in the same Gitesi commune, we were on the border with the Mwendo commune. Our secteur is neighbouring to the Mwendo commune. So you see that there is a long distance between our locality to the town, and without the means of transportation, there weren't a lot of vehicles to enable us to get to the town. It was difficult going to town.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>I also want to ask you a few questions about the roadblock erected to get money. You stated initially that the roadblock was erected to get money by two people, by the two people you mentioned, and then later on you said it was to check banditry. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>It was the bandits, the thieves who erected the barriers, the roadblocks. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-bossa">
            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>Was it to check property taken from the Tutsi or Hutu who were being robbed of their property during the war? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, they wanted money. When they saw somebody who had money who was passing by, and because nobody could protect that person, he was asked to give all his money. They were strong, they were carrying weapons, clubs, spears, and when you see the club, you have to give your money, because you might die in the process if you don't. So you will understand that a Tutsi couldn't go through this roadblock; they were hiding. </p>

            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. And that is exactly my next question. Why were they afraid to go on these roadblocks, to go through them, if they were to check for money? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>People were passing by and when they got to the roadblock they would take their money, but they were not able to take money from a lot of people because when they realised that that was the purpose of the roadblock, people were going through the bush. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No. Before the war, elections took place, and I wasn't elected because I did not have the time to deal with administrative issues, given my trade, my business.</p>

            <p>I spoke of a roadblock which was at a place which I could see; that's the one I mentioned. I couldn't move around to see what was happening elsewhere.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, I told you that I was no longer a member of the cellule committee. When the war broke out I was no longer a member of the committee for the cellule.Those people were coming from other secteurs, but they were stronger than we were. We didn't have any means of defending ourselves; I'm referring to people who lived in the cellule. The people who came from elsewhere were stronger than us.</p>

          <sp who="#judge-khan">

            <p>Okay. You said that Karegeya was taken away by a man called Bapfakurera in your presence? </p>

          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I saw him. Before I didn't know Bapfakurera's name, but later on I informed myself and I realised that the people -- the person who was taking away Karegeya was called Bapfakurera.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE KHAN:</speaker>
            <p>Karegeya was your well-wisher, he was your boss, he had given you the land free of cost. Did you take any step to save him from that man? </p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Witness, when you were asked by the Prosecution why there was a discrepancy between, on the one hand, the information concerning the Karegeya killing in your statement to investigators and, on the other hand, your information in your '98 interview to the Rwandan prosecutor, you said that you later carried out investigations. Did I understand you correctly? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>I was able to obtain information, and that was necessary. When you see someone leading attackers, you should be interested in knowing who that person is, so that later on you can say who that person was exactly, the person leading the attackers.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, when did you proceed to obtain such information? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>When order was re-established, when the authority began to become operational, before one could meet people who were bragging about having done this or that, so when you heard that you would say to yourself, "There's information which is circulating. I should collect it and know what really happened". And that's how I started to carry out my small investigations until I had information which confirmed that the person whom I saw, although I didn't know his name, was indeed the person who was leading the attackers. So now I had his name, the name of the person whom I had seen, although at the time I saw him I didn't know his name.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So when did you start your investigations, approximately; in which year? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>It was after the war. It was around August, after the war. It was at that point in time that one could move about to go where people were meeting. One could hear people bragging about what they had done. You could hear them in bars, and this was how I was able to obtain information. So when this information was gathered and it was confirmed, at that time we were then sure that we had in hand the information we were looking for.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Does this imply that you started your investigations in August '94? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Well, we could hear rumours, but we were not sure that the information was true. I couldn't rush and provide information which I had not checked out. So after his death, I started to collect information. Even though the authorities had not become operational, I started to gather information gradually while awaiting for order to be re-established.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So you started gathering information gradually in 1994; is that correct? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Well, you see, after the death of that person I started gradually to collect information, so you would continue to inform yourself in this manner until you receive all the details so that you have the exact information. That's how I proceeded.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>And what interests me now, Mr. Witness, is the time, and I have understood you to the effect that you started this exercise in '94; is my comprehension correct, please? Just yes or no. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, immediately after the death of this person. But now I know the truth, and now I know that Bapfakurera was, in fact, the person I saw leading the attackers. People saw him, and they informed me.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, when did you receive information that this person, this leader, was in fact Mr. Bapfakurera? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>It was when I came back from the prosecutor's office. You know, I was called by the inspector of the judicial police. It's after that that I started to collect information. Even the IPJ came to carry out information. He told me, "Now you can go back home, because I know the truth". At that point in time I myself continued to inform myself and I was able to get to know where the person who had been killed had been taken by Bapfakurera, where Bapfakurera had taken him to kill him.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So from '94 to August '98, in spite of investigations, you did not find out the name of the man who took Mr. Karegeya away? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>He was not someone who was always there. At a point in time he fled, but people were saying it was him, others were saying it wasn't him, so there were contradictions, accusations and counter-accusations. He left, and after a moment he came back. He went to Zaire and he came back home. It was after his return that I continued to collect information and we were able to get to know that he was the one, and he was arrested and put in prison.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So how did you first hear his name mentioned as the possible leader in this group? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>Well, it was being said all the time, but these people who were talking about him didn't know whom I had seen. However, it was when I was able to say that the person who I saw was the cobbler, it's then that they were able to say, "Oh, yes, that person is Bapfakurera", and the members of the population in fact said where he had taken -- he had found Cyprien and where he had taken him to kill him.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>And when did you obtain this clarity? Which year? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>I knew it, but I didn't know his name. I knew he was a cobbler; he was someone who was working and would move to markets to go and work. I knew him, but I didn't know his name. It was only after he came back from exile that I was able to know that that cobbler was in fact Bapfakurera.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I understand that, Mr. Witness, and when was that? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, I cannot give you an exact date. That was a long time ago. But it was after I came back from the prosecutor's office.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So, in which year; can you help us with that, please? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>I think that if you were to look at the report of the interview that we had before the court, you can find the date. I cannot remember the date myself.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, what I want to know from you now is when were you in a position, because of this information concerning the cobbler -- just a moment, just a moment. Listen to the question, because we are not communicating well now, Mr. Witness.Now, the question is as follows: when, which year, were you able, based on the information concerning the cobbler and the fact that the person had returned from another country, to establish that that person was indeed Mr. Bapfakurera? Which year were you able to establish that? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dl">
            <speaker>WITNESS DL:</speaker>
            <p>No, actually he hadn't left the country, he had fled to the Nduga area in Gitarama prefecture, and that's where he had fled to. There were some people who had fled towards Zaire, but given his profession, he continued to work within Rwanda itself. I was summoned by the IPJ to the prosecutor's office. After I came back, he himself returned home, and it's at that point in time the IPJ came to our home to carry out investigations. I suspect the IPJ knew it was him, and he said, "I have done my investigations. I know you are innocent, and now I know how Cyprien was killed. You don't have any problem". So he sent me to fetch witnesses; the witnesses met him and gave him the information.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Witness, are you in a position to remember the year in which you found out that it was Mr. Bapfakurera who was the leader? Which year was that? </p>

And Nors said, "But I can't go back home. I don't have any means of transport. What am I going to do?" The doctor allowed him to extend his sick leave so that he can recover fully. So the doctor said, "You wait. When you find a vehicle which can take you back you can leave. For the time being we have a lot of difficulties. We have a lot of people who are unwell."</p>

On the 26th of May 1994 you had the assignment of taking Mr. Nors back to his home, together with the wife of one doctor. Now, this is confirmed by the log-book which you gave a copy -- of which you gave a copy to us and a copy which I also gave to the Bench.

            <p>The doctor told me to take Nors back, and the doctor's wife. And we reached the Kayenzi roadblock, and the people who were at the roadblock took Nors. The first time I had defended him and I was able to get him back, but when I was doing the return trip they refused to accept what I was saying. They insisted that I had told them lies, that he was a Belgian, and they took him. They were saying that he was a Belgian who was an accomplice of the Inkotanyi Tutsis.</p>

            <p>They removed the tree trunk and the stones which were used to block the road and told me to continue. And when I did not leave they told me that I had to leave. So I left with the vehicle. I went a certain distance and I stopped. They then said, "Oh, he's stopping again." And they said, "Arrest him also."So when I saw them coming towards me -- but I remained there for some time, because I was telling myself that they were going to have pity on the man. And when I saw an attacker come towards me armed with a club I immediately entered the vehicle. He struck me with the club on my back. I started the vehicle. After a certain distance I stopped. The lady said, "But they're going to kill you, because they are not stopping from telling you to continue <stage>(sic).</stage> So I drove slowly and I stopped at the place -- I stopped close by a eucalyptus tree, and I was able to see them as they were coming from the bush where they had just killed the person. They were content. They were happy as if they had done something good, whereas they had just killed someone. And after that I left. So that is what happened. That is how this person was taken away from me.</p>

            <p>Yes, Mr. President, I may intervene on this matter. The witness -- Witness CGC, a Prosecution witness indeed testified that Mr. Ndindabahizi allegedly distributed machetes at a roadblock the witness is referring to now, and that immediately after that act, a half-caste was killed at that same roadblock. The killing, or the murder of that half-caste was therefore allegedly the direct consequence of the presence of Mr. Ndindabahizi at the roadblock, as testified to by the witness, CGC, and so we are trying to corroborate the testimony of this witness and what has been said by the previous witness.</p>

            <p>"Mr. So-and-so, son of so-and-so, and so-and-so, Mabanza commune, 20th of September 1995. Subject: Explanations on the murder of Nors -- Joseph Nors. I, the undersigned, was a victim of violence on the 25th of May l994. And on the 26th of May 1994, at the Kayenzi roadblock, I was assaulted by Gaspari Bamuriki, who was in charge of that roadblock, and it was that person that I was able to recognise. There were other persons there whose names I did not know, but I did seek some information concerning their names. They were Bigirimana, Rwibasira, François, Ndigabo, Niyigemana, Capitoro, Simeon, Komeza," and there is another name that is not legible. "They were many, such that there must be other names that I didn't mention, and probably the person in charge of the roadblock could supply, that is," Mr. Bamuriki, Gaspari, who was in charge of that group, actually. "They got him out of the vehicle, they took his bag and took off his shoes, his watch, his spectacles, and searched him. Following that" -- this is illegible. The next sentence is illegible."Subsequently, I saw them bring out clubs to strike me, and I went away and stopped a little bit further down, and I came back on foot and when I got to the place where they were standing, they saw me; they were coming from the bush and they were armed with clubs, swords, spears and sticks and hoes. The person who killed him, his name could be given to you by the person responsible for the roadblock, because he was responsible for his death and he knows the reasons why that person was killed." Nota bene: " Their excuse was, his identity card on which it was said that he had naturalised and there were two stamps to it. Ndikuyeze, as far as he was concerned, on the 25th of May, l994, accused him of being a Belgian whereas he had been a refugee for a long time. He said that he had been a refugee for a long time, and that he was an accomplice to the Belgian criminals. This was what I was able to see. When they took him, I was in the company of a lady called Gahongajire, Gratio." Signature, and end of translation, sir.</p>

            <p>Now, following those events, Witness, did you see in the written statement, and in the letter that we have just read, that you carried out your own investigation? Could you shade light on the inquiries that you carried out that enabled you, for example, to establish the letter of the 25th May, and to tell the Defence investigators what you have told them, including what you told them in June 2003 -- in October, rather, in October 2003 -- in August, in August?

            <speaker>WITNESS DV:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dv">
            <speaker>WITNESS DV:</speaker>
            <p>Perhaps I came across a group of persons that were on the road, but they hadn't erected a roadblock, so that there was no roadblock. I would say that there were a group of bandits.</p>

            <p>The meter was read and the figures taken, and at the next mission the figures were also taken down, and it was from these figures that the logbook was filled.

            <p>It was Mr. Leonart that inserted the date 26th, and it was the doctor -- now, so far as the 24th is concerned, that is the handwriting of the accountant. It was the accountant that went on up to the 25th.</p>

Leonart completed the dates and somebody else, the accountant, completed the name of the driver and the destination; is it? Two separate people filled in this document, sir.</p>

            <p>Yes, Mr. President. We have five witnesses here in Arusha, five witnesses which we have not been able to prepare. Certainly we would have been able to prepare them if we had come here earlier to Arusha, but let me draw your attention to the fact that the Defence session has not allowed us to come here before the 24th of October, which is regrettable. Even those who could have come to Arusha with their own means, I could not have imposed that on the whole team, and so we have not been able to prepare these five witnesses. This is my proposal, Mr. President, that we adjourn until Thursday afternoon. If this is agreeable to the Chamber, we could have a session on Thursday afternoon and Friday. So we will have only tomorrow and the morning of Thursday to prepare the said witnesses, and I believe in one afternoon and one day we will be able to advance and move on with the five witnesses remaining.</p>

And thank you for making the point, because that was one of my questions yesterday, why this had not been done last week, and now I understand why the Defence were not in a position to do that. So that was useful information, thank you. All right, this brings us to the end of Tuesday, and we will then meet again on Thursday in the afternoon as just agreed.

You are of course under the obligation to tell the truth, and the registry will now take your solemn declaration.</p>

            <p>The reason for which I took part in the massacres, I am not really in a position to explain them to you as such, but I believe that all of that was due to the death of the president of the republic.

            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>I took part in massacres in various locations. I took part in massacres that started at the Rutsiro commune on the 11th, on the 11th of April 1994. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, many people were killed. If I look at the number of victims that fell at the communal office of Rutsiro, but also in other areas of the commune, people were killed, a lot of people. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>Well, we got to the Rutsiro communal office on the 11th, and at that time people had already killed the priest of the Murunda parish. The authorities arrested those criminals on around the 9th, it was around the 9th that the priest was killed. We got there on the 11th to see who killed the priest, and when we arrived we found some gendarmes on the spot. They had come to protect the Rutsiro communal office. It was those gendarmes that handed over the first person to us; that was the police inspector of Rutsiro commune, and we killed him. It was thus that the massacre started, sir. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>As far as the gendarmes were concerned, they handed over the police inspector of the Rutsiro commune and asked us to kill all those people that were in the house housing various art objects. So that in doing so we were assisted by the members of the communal police, sir. </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

            <p>As far as Gitwa is concerned, in view of the fact that several days ago we had killed the refugees at the church and of course those that were at the stadium, but I did not know that I was going to be compelled to do it again. In response to questions concerning that location, I believe it was the 22nd, that is, one week after the church and the stadium massacres. </p>

            <p>There were no vehicles; we couldn't get any vehicles because we were so many. Those people that had access to vehicles were our leaders, for example, the military, some of them. There were also the vehicles belonging to certain businessmen, or, for example, if a bourgmestre had a vehicle. Some of the vehicles would carry personalities who came round to see what happened during the massacres. But so far as we were concerned, we went around on foot.</p>

            <p>Let me speak to you of two days on which I went to Gitwa. I went, for instance, today, then I went back and then the next day I went again. It was during that time that we killed people. This is because in the initial days we were not adequately prepared. The soldiers told us to go back to where we came from because they were going to look for material, and it was the next day that we went back and killed the victims.</p>

            <p>Yes. Those who live around Kibuye would go back to their homes and we would find them again the next morning. As for us who came from far away, we went back to where we were living in Ruganda, and the following morning we would meet again in order to go to launch the attack.</p>

            <p>After killing the victims of Kibuye on the 18th, we remained for some days drinking beer and eating meat, and that means that we resumed the attacks about a week later. So I would say that we launched the attack on Gitwa one week after the attacks on Kibuye town.</p>

And the leaders of the various groups introduced themselves to one another before the attack was launched. At the end of those formalities, the soldiers had already surrounded the victims to avoid the possibility of anyone escaping. And the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune fired a shot and the soldiers also fired at the same time -- fired shots at the same time.

            <p>Around 1991 or 1992, I went to Kibuye in the company of the ************************ in order to visit his child who was sick at the Kibuye hospital. And once we got to the Kibuye roundabout, a vehicle came down and the **************pointed out to me one man and told me that he was working in the cabinet of the prime minister.</p>

What you were expected to do, was done.</p>

            <p>When he was still in Kibuye and when we were at the roadblock and were told that there was a white man who was in Kibuye who had to be killed, we asked those men at the roadblock; including one Kapitolo. Kapitolo was a bus driver. His bus goes through Gisiza and will go all the way to Gisenyi, so we ask him whether it was necessary for this man to die. He said, "Yes, he has to die."

            <p>Very well, thank you, Witness. Now, let us move on to another issue. The investigators of this Tribunal, the investigators of the Prosecutor, did they come to visit you in prison to ask you to testify against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>During the trial of Préfet Kayishema, I was in Kibuye, and the prison guard came to see me inside the prison and took me to the Prosecutor's office. When we arrived at the Prosecutor's office he told me these two white men are looking for people that are aware of what Ndindabahizi was doing. He explained that he was going to take me away to explain what I knew about Emmanuel Ndindabahizi and about the crimes that we had committed together. He said that I was going to be paid 50 dollars. This is all that I know.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>The prison guard told me that if I gave good explanations they were going to give me 50 dollars, but the two white persons were with a judicial police inspector from Kibuye who was translating into Kinyarwanda. The IPJ talked to the white people, and the white man answered and he explained to me what they had said in Kinyarwanda, but I was not able to do that. We didn't agree, so that I had to go back to prison. So that the prison guard, upon saying that, told me that I would never ever have permission to go out even to draw some water from the well, because if I go out I would be killed, so that I never went out of prison. I stayed inside the prison.</p>

            <p>Madam The Judge, can I make three points? One is this person came to testify in all sincerity. Two. Nothing in the RP on the statutes of the Tribunal makes a distinction between detainees and others so -- a detained witnesses and non-detained witness. Three. I believe, of course, it is up to the Tribunal to determine. As far as I'm concerned, this man recognised his crimes, he pleaded guilty, and that would mitigate in favour of his credibility. Finally, the Prosecutor himself introduced in his evidence a detained witness himself.</p>

            <p>You testified a minute ago that you were saddened by the death of the Tutsis that you killed. Would I be correct in saying that you were saddened after the genocide and not during the time you were killing these Tutsis? Is that a fair assumption to make?</p>

            <p>That is correct. I was saddened afterwards, when I thought about the people I had killed, with whom I had no problems whatsoever, the problems concerning land tenure or any other problems. That is why I wanted to testify, because there are many people who do not want to speak out. I believe that all should be brought out to light so that never again should that occur, so that people will denounce these crimes.</p>

            <p>A lot of firearms were used at the Kibuye stadium. The killers were more numerous than the victims. I was responsible for the death of all those people, because I was with the killers. You can't pinpoint those who are responsible for the stadium massacres, as there were many of them, and one wonders who they are. They couldn't be found, they aren't in prison. It is a mystery. People were killed in my presence, even if I didn't deal any blow or if I did not strike anybody. Had anybody approached me, I would have killed that somebody, because that is what I was there for. We were just like these, but a person, I did not kill anybody. But I am responsible for the death of those people, because I was with the killers. But nobody approached me to the extent that I was in a position to kill them.</p>

I was assisting. I was like a supervisor. I wore a military uniform. I was a chief, and looted material was given to me, but I didn't kill anybody at the church.

Even if one hadn't killed anybody, one had to carry these weapons. There were many people who were more zealous and wanted to kill more people, and I believe that all those people are now dead.

            <p>Can you explain to me why the bourgmestre of Gishyita commune would have been more interested in exterminating Tutsis on Gitwa hill, and not the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune in whose commune he is located? Could you help me with that, sir, in your opinion?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>I am going to give you an explanation, and please understand this explanation as I give it to you, unless you have another explanation. But what I am telling you is the truth. The Gishyita bourgmestre was in the company of his conseiller who was often with him during that period of time, and when we found him at Kibuye, he found us where he was lodging, and he was in the company of his conseiller. This was before we attacked the victims at the stadium. These two people first of all passed by where we were lodged. Now, as for the Gitwa attack, when we arrived the vehicles were already parked, and whilst the various positions were being determined for the attackers to take, when we concluded the attack we went back. When we reached the town, the bourgmestre gave us money, and he told us, "You have come from very far, you are living here in Ruganda, but who is looking after you?" It's at that point in time that I came forward with my group and the bourgmestre gave us money and the conseiller did like wise.Those were the circumstances under which I collaborated with that bourgmestre who was armed with a gun at that time.Furthermore, the conseiller who was with him told us whilst we were at Gitwa that one Sindikubwabo wouldn't want that a block from the wall remains in place. He wanted us to completely destroy the house and exterminate all the members of the family. This is what we heard from the bourgmestre, and this information is true. I don't know what you can deduce from the bourgmestre that you are referring to.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, where was the bourgmestre of Gitesi commune when you participated in the attack at the Kibuye stadium and the church in Kibuye, was he with you?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>I decided to speak the truth, and now that I am here before the judges I must tell you the truth. It is true that my case has been closed, but the tribunal and the prosecution office in Rwanda has invited me to testify. I am telling you the truth. During the killings at the church, if you were at the Kibuye roundabout, you would see the hill. Now, to tell you the truth about the events that took place during he massacres, I cannot tell you that the bourgmestre was in such and such a place, but I know that you have good investigators and you are well able to analyse the sequence of events. We killed the people at the church whilst the bourgmestre was holding his cheek at the office, looking at the people. From the bureau communal you can see the church opposite, and when we came back from the church, we would see the bourgmestre always there, his hand on the cheek.At the bureau communal, one of the policemen shot at us. The person who was shot was taken to the hospital by us. We left the person at the hospital. We had wanted to demolish the communal office, but the Gitesi commune bourgmestre tried to reconcile us with the person who had shot at us. I don't know whether he was a soldier or policeman, and the bourgmestre managed to reconcile us.</p>

Two documents; for all my sins, I couldn't have these documents translated into English, but I managed to have them done in French for my learned friend's convenience, and I have been made to understand what they contain. One document has -- well both documents have a covering sheet in French and then the original is what you see in bold, in Kinyarwanda, which is the Kinyarwanda document, and the French translation. We expect to get an English translation some time after the proceedings.Let me take Your Honours and the Court through the document so you can follow me as I read. The front document which is common to both bundles is self-explanatory. It's simply a covering letter transmitting the dossier to the court. Pages 1 to 5, this is the indictment of this Accused person in a joint trial with some 69 other people who are listed from page 1 to page 5.So it is this person, there is a little summary on him there, we had it translated. And then, 69 other names who are his accomplices. That is page 1 to 5 of the indictment.Turning to page six of the French translation, sir, we then have the indictment itself, and the allegations against the Accused person, and the 69 co-conspirators, and that is from page 6 to page 9. That is the end of that document as far as the French translation is concerned.Page l0, the document starting - that runs from page l0 to page 15, is an interview between this Accused person and an officer of the tribunal of the first instance in Kibuye, an interview which took place on the 24th of January 2000. You will find that document from page l0 to page 15.Finally, on page 16 and 17 of the French translation, you will find another document dated 20th January 1999, which, in fact, is a translation and typing of a handwritten letter from this Accused person personally, to the prosecutor of the republic, the Kibuye prosecution's office - it's on two pages, page 16 and 17, and in words that are the accused person's confession.</p>

            <p>The last document, Your Honours, in the French bundle is the document transmitting the confession itself to the court, to the court of first instance -- sorry, I'll repeat that: It's the document transmitting the confession from the investigating officials to the prosecutor's office. It is like a covering document for the confession, and it refers to not only the confession itself, but to the interview with this accused person. Those are extracts. The French documents are simply extracts from the Rwandan, the Kinyarwandan document, which is more robust, and that's why I have given Your Honours both documents.</p>

Grateful, Your Honour. </p>

            <p>Mr. President, I have one or two issues to raise before the translation. This document has just been disclosed to me, and I think it is becoming a habit for the Prosecutor to not give us a number -- the adequate time to verify the authenticity of the document. The second point is that the witness has just said that this document is incomplete and that there were other documents, other confessions who -- which will complete this document. I would therefore request the Court to accept this document with a lot of caution, first of all, regarding its authenticity and, secondly, regarding its completeness. I see that the document has 447 pages, and here we have only about 20 pages. It's -- I believe that this is a document which has been divided into pieces.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Just a moment. Did you just mention about 400 pages, Mr. Besnier? Are you then referring to the original in Kinyarwanda or the translation?</p>

            <p>The document in Kinyarwanda has a list of transcripts, exhibits, pages, which begin with page C00 under chapter 7 titled in French, "An inventory of the case", and a listing continues all the way to C447. The least would have been to give the Court the full document. </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, if I can be of assistance to the Court. I generated the document so I know the history of this document more than he does. Now, the Kinyarwanda document is the original version. We have over 400 or 500 pages downstairs. Now, there are 69 people charged in the indictment, in fact, 70 plus the accused, rather, the witness who sits there; therefore, there are witness statements not only for him but for 69 other people, and we have the entire dossier downstairs. If my learned friend wants me to photocopy it, I will send it to him. It's not a problem, it's right there. So he is correct, it does refer to 400 pages, and I have them downstairs; if he wants them, he can have them. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So you are offering, maybe not to copy this because to copy this will be a large volume, but you are offering inspection?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So that's that. And we have noted your comment concerning the need for caution here, Mr. Besnier; we have noted that issue. And we are also aware that you have been provided with this, as I understand it, just before this came up, so we note this. Now, do you -- having glanced through this in French from page 16 here, and you may well have had time to do that also, on the Defence side. Have you done that, Defence? It seems to me that it is correct, that there is no reference to at least the Gitwa episode in the document. So, what I am asking is really whether there is a need to start reading and translating this document in view of the fact that we will be receiving an English version afterwards, if some elements are not disputed between the parties. </p>

            <p>The hill is fairly large, but since it is not my locality, and since I came running after the enemy who is being chased, I came from the Kibuye direction, I came from Kibuye going to the direction of Gitwa, and on our way back we went around the hill.

            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>I didn't change anything in what I did. I have said everything I did. I have answered the questions that were put to me, because deep within myself I was convinced that I had acted the bad way and that I should tell that to my friends and to all other people.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-khan">
            <speaker>JUDGE KHAN:</speaker>
            <p>We just want to know what made you to make the confession. What are the reasons for your confession before the Rwandan court? And why did you choose to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth before this Chamber, before this Tribunal? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>What brought me to speak the truth is that I looked at the conditions, the very deplorable conditions in which we killed the victims who were innocent. They were innocent. That is why on the 20th of July 1995, I went to the Rutsire, to the Rutsiro communal office to confess about what happened in that commune. I did not know that I would get to Kibuye to see how things because it was very difficult for me at Kibuye after having made a confession. And once I was at Kibuye, my heart, my self-consciousness told me that I had acted badly. I even talked to my co-accused and asked them why they were not ready to confess and in reply, they told me that they had acted negatively and that they were not ready to confess their acts and that would be against the law. I decided to confess because we had acted badly. I cannot run away from it, and to date I am still ready to stand up to say so. I have no fears as far as that is concerned.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>I sent it to the office of the prosecutor of the republic at Kibuye, sir. I was told that the documents concerning the Kibuye events had been lost so that I had to compile the same documents containing my confessions, and I returned the copy, and at Ruhengeri, I also did the same thing, I confessed as to what had happened in Kibuye. I returned a copy as well.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So this letter of 4th of March '98 was sent to the office of the prosecutor at Kibuye. Was it a confession, yes or no?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>I told them when I confessed the acts in Kibuye and the time, at which I made my confession, I asked that the documents be sought from within the letter. I did not at the time plead guilty.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>The letter of 4th March '98, did that letter in itself contain the descriptions of what happened in, for instance, Gitwa?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>That letter narrates the manner in which got to Kibuye and attacked the stadium and the church, Bisesero, as far as what we did at the Gaseke roadblock. After having enumerated, I told them after having enumerated those facts.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>I had already made those confessions at the beginning when I got to Kibuye.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>When did you first make those confessions about these particular events?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dc">
            <speaker>WITNESS DC:</speaker>
            <p>The first time I made those confessions was on the 18th of November 1995 when I arrived at Kibuye. I made those confessions at the prosecutor's office. And when I went into prison, I told them that I had committed those crimes, and on the 28th February 1998 I made public confessions so as not to hide anything. And then later on I wrote another letter to the attorney-general's office, the prosecutor's office, because I did not only want to talk about what happened in Rutsiro, I also wanted to talk about what happened in Kibuye. And it was the 4th of March 1998 that I wrote a letter to the prosecutor's office narrating those facts.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So in other words the letter of 18th November '95 contains the same events more or less as the letter of 4th of March '98; isn't that so?</p>

            <p>That is quite possible. It's possible that the contents of the document be the same, because I usually do not change what I could sign in a document signed by myself. Of course, we were afraid to a certain extent, because when we gave detailed explanations we had to do with the consequences -- we had to suffer the consequences.</p>

            <p>I was not accused of crimes committed at Kibuye. I was accused of crimes committed in Rutsiro, not Kibuye. It was said that killers came from Rutsiro and committed crimes at Kibuye, and I was the first one to confess that.

            <p>It was following the Gitwa attack. I did say that I could not tell the precise date thereof in view of the fact that I was not anticipating responding to questions on that issue. That attack was the last attack at that location where there were many refugees. That was around the end of April. But in May, there were other attacks. The whites came to stop the massacres at Kibuye. Even when they arrived, there were attacks being launched.</p>

            <p>I reached Gisiza and I met a group of men escorting Karegeya. The men had found him in a sorghum field where he was hiding. There was Ahingereje, Ruganamanzi, those were the most important members of that group. We went down together, and we reached Gitaka. And they made him sit in front of Karara's house. Ndagijimana struck him with a club between his shoulders, and the others said, "It's not a good idea to kill him in front of someone else's house. Let's take him behind the houses." They did that, and I followed them.When I got there, they made him sit down on the ground and Misago and another man, Bisagara, struck him with clubs to the head, and he died. After that, we left him there and we went back up. </p>

            <p>I was at Gitaka during that period of time. We were in the house drinking beer and those who were at the door said Ndindabahizi had arrived. Many people went out to go and see him, including myself. When I got there, he was surround by these people. He was asking the group of people, "Who killed these people around here?" And he went on to say, "Who gave you the orders to kill people?" And the people kept quite. So he called out Karara, he greeted him and put to him that question. "You live here. Who killed your neighbours?" Karara kept quite; he didn't have anything to say. So the question was repeated, "Who killed Karegeya? You see that his house had been destroyed". Karara kept quite. Someone came out of the bar and said in a low voice that there was one Gatete who had killed people. Gatete was called and when Gatete arrived, Ndindabahizi asked him, "Is it really you who exterminated the people here?" Now, when Gatete heard this, he went backwards and ran away. So Ndindabahizi took Karara and said, "Since you haven't said who it is who has killed these people, since you are their neighbour and you see that my cattle have been looted, I'm going to arrest you." And he immediately took him away. Up until today Ndindabahizi has not come back. That was towards the beginning of July, at the time when people who started to flee. And from that time on Ndindabahizi has never come back to our area.</p>

            <p>I can assert that because I am a neighbour of his family. When he came, people would speak about it and say he - "Ndindabahizi has arrived". Furthermore, he had given gifts as a cow to his family and people were happy. So I would be able to know because I am a neighbour to his family.

            <p>Your Honour, we just had an observation. We just wondered if there was any pressing reason why we couldn't cross-examine this witness today. We only intend to be ten minutes with him. Unless Your Honour has a pressing engagement, I'm quite happy to finish him today and then you can ask judges' questions tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Your Honours would find on your desks a document in Kinyarwanda with a translation in French and a translation in English. So there are three -- or two documents, because the French might be stapled to the Kinyarwanda, but the English is obviously separate. Some of you might have three, some might have two, but you all have the same documents. So do my learned friends.Can I ask the registry to place the Kinyarwanda version in -- before the witness, please. Just the Kinyarwanda one, because he doesn't read English or French, obviously. The top one, the handwritten one, thank you. </p>

I accompanied the group of killers. We got to Gitaka, and I stayed at the place where those persons were killed. This was why I decided to recognise the crime because I feared that I might be told later that I was also responsible because I was in the company of the killers.

            <p>Well, in a word or two, I believe that the prosecutor's office accepted that I have spoken the truth, and they gave me a document to that effect. Now, we, the accused, have pleaded guilty, we are very few in the prison. We decided to look for more evidence to submit to the prosecutor's office. We held a meeting, a meeting of people that had pleaded guilty. People had come from all areas of the commune. We went outside the prison, we held a meeting, and we elected a leader, a leader that represented all the accused of all the communes, and we called him the préfet. So the préfet appointed one person per commune, and we called him bourgmestre, the bourgmestre. And in the commune we appointed councillors for each secteur, and each councillor appointed people per cellule, a leader for each cellule, and those people appointed police officers. Now, this is the structure of those that have pleaded guilty, and we held a meeting.Now, the secteurs came together and appointed people for each cell or cellule. Now, that was to ensure that all the accused who pleaded guilty were present in the meetings. We established a list of all the people killed in every cellule. That we did, and after that we spelt out the names of the killers of those people so that we were sure that nobody would say that he did not participate in such or such a killing, because we were there. So that if anybody wanted to lie, we will put the truth into his fruit <stage>(sic)</stage> and tell him that he was lying, since we committed the crime together. So that is the situation, because you cannot lie in such a situation. If the prosecutor has more questions, I am ready to answer questions because I have pleaded guilty. There are details that I did not mention. Perhaps they could be asked. I'm sure that even Gacaca will have other questions to respond to. This is what I wanted to say. We were telling the truth. We did not want to lie any more. So, this is all I wanted to say. </p>

Is it not the case, Mr. Witness, that you and your co-detainees in Gisovu prison, and other prisons in and around Rwanda, have formed a solidarity, a Hutu solidarity; and the object, is it not the case, of that solidarity, Mr. Witness, is to absolve your Hutu brothers who are now in custody before this Tribunal of their crimes? That's what the essence of what you've just told us, isn't it? You now have a préfet amongst yourselves, you have your own bourgmestres, a government in prison, so to speak, and you have all come together, formulated your evidence with a view to assisting those leaders in 1994 of their crimes.

            <p>No, sir. I have something to say about what you've just said. I pleaded guilty. I spoke the truth. I believe that I cannot speak about the co-perpetrators. If I confessed, I cannot begin to absolve anybody that participated in the criminal activities that we are talking about. As far as the government that you're referring to is concerned, this is not a government. We, rather, tried to establish the truth, and we succeeded in convincing many people to plead guilty. And indeed, before that, it was very difficult for the prosecution to know what really happened. </p>

            <p>No, sir. The bourgmestres in the prison, do not -- they do not counsel the accused; rather, they tell you to say the truth on what you have done. Now, those people were appointed to convince the detainees to speak the truth about the acts they have carried out.

            <p>Mr. President, at this juncture I should like to make an observation. This document was only disclosed to us after the beginning of this hearing. I believe that it is regrettable. We are not here in a theatre where we have coup d'état and surprises. We are here to be serious. The parties should disclose the material they have, and the Prosecutor should be told that when he has important material, he should disclose the material to his learned friends on the Defence. This is the observation I wanted to make, Mr. President. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>The observation is noted, Your Honour, but this is an adversarial proceeding, and the whole point of the exercise is to impeach the credibility of the witness. His witness should be forthcoming in telling him the truth. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Besnier, we have noted your remark, and we have also taken into account that this is the second time this happened; you made a similar remark yesterday. The Chamber has discussed the matter.Now, the Prosecutor is, as indicated by Mr. Phillips, under no legal obligation to disclose in advance documents of this character. It is also important, of course, also stressed by the Prosecutor, that in adversarial proceedings, the party be given the possibility, cross-examining the witness, to impeach the credibility -- I don't take a position whether this was actually done in the present case, but now I'm at the general level -- to impeach the credibility by submitting documents which have not previously been made known to the witness. So the Prosecutor is right in that respect.On the other hand, we all think that the Defence remark is legitimate in the sense that once the witness is in the witness box, there is no longer any contact between the witness and any of the lawyers, any of the teams, either on the Prosecution or the Defence side; and for that reason, the element of surprise and the possibility to impeach the witness would not be reduced if the Prosecution were to provide the Defence with documents the Prosecution intends to rely upon when the cross-examining is starting or even once the witness has entered the witness box and therefore is incommunicado for the Defence. So, that would reduce the element of surprise for the Defence without reducing the possibility of the Prosecution to impeach the credibility, and we think that is a practice that should be followed in this case as it has been followed in previous cases. So if that could kindly be observed from now on. </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, we have an observation to make. It's an observation that centres on the inequality or equality of arms.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>The Defence, during the Prosecution's case, adopted the same practice. The same courtesy was not afforded to the Prosecution. It is, for want of a better word, unfair and prejudicial to the Prosecution to be asked to submit documents of their own witnesses. They are calling the witnesses, not my witness. They should be making the disclosure to me because they know, they ought to know the evidence and the documents. We were not afforded the same privilege. They sprang up with documents; I never objected because that is the essence of an adversarial system. The issue you make about the witness being in the box would not be helpful. Learned counsel, with all due respect, would only tailor his examination to suit the evidence there. The whole purpose of it -- and in any jurisdiction in the whole world, it is a noted fact that it is not a disclosure obligation of the party impeaching the witness to disclose the evidence beforehand. It is absolutely unfair.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Yeah. Now, we are well aware, coming from many jurisdictions in the world, of what is the practice in the world, so we do not need to be reminded about that.I also take your point, Mr. Phillips, that when it comes to a document which may affect the way in which the examination-in-chief may be conducted, then certainly you will not be doing that until your cross-examination starts. So that's absolutely -- I totally agree with you there. So in other words, when I made the remark about the moment he -- you may, of course, be able to wait with showing documents to the Defence if that could influence the examination-in-chief of the Defence. That point is taken. But the remainder of the remark remains; that is, namely, that we have now in Trial Chamber I, for at least two years, observed the practice I just outlined, and it's a matter of courtesy. It's not a binding rule. It's not a clear-cut rule, but it facilitates the proceedings in the courtroom.Now, coming, then, to the point of the equality between the parties, I can't -- are there any documents or episodes in particular you want to recall? You will remember -- I don't recall you having made any objections previously in that connection, but that is, as you say, because you accept the adversarial principle.</p>

Maybe he forgot to mention Karegeya's name, but I had asked him to do so. I'm positive that I asked him to add Karegeya's name. There were two documents. First of all, there was a document in which my confession appeared, and then there was a document in which I was testifying on persons who killed Karegeya in my presence.

            <speaker>WITNESS DM:</speaker>
            <p>At that time I did not mention Rwasibo simply because I was talking about myself. When I gave my testimony perhaps I should have mentioned him in my testimony, but with regard to my confession, the confession is about what I did personally. But the testimony about -- that arose in the second part and his name is mentioned therein. I think there's a portion of my testimony which you did not receive. There were two parts, my confession and then my testimony. It is possible to see it in one portion of the document and not in the other.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>

We were afraid. We lived harmoniously on the hill, we used to work together, and we were ensuring our own -- our security together, but later when houses -- when they started burning houses in Mabanza, the events went all the way to Ruragwe and people came by saying, "Well, you have not done anything," that is when we started killing, and one person -- you attack a person you knew and you kill him. It is a matter of shame and we are very sad about that. I am very saddened by the crimes that I have committed and I know it will create problems for the courts, and that is why I decided to confess my guilt.</p>

            <p>It took time for us to begin killing, but then later on, when we started killing, what could the authorities do against thousands of people? It was impossible to quieten those people. That was a major problem to the authorities. Those were killings never seen before; unspeakable, but I couldn't see how the authorities could arrest those killings, and had they attempted to stop us, probably the situation would have worsened. Thus, we started killing, it was because we were very nervous. We had become more like beasts. This is the only adjective I could use to describe us.</p>

            <p>A general remark. When there is a list of names given by the witness, and the same list is given in a piece of paper, then, I think, the practical way to proceed is to ensure that the court reporter has the same list. For the time being, it would appear that that list has not been distributed to the court reporters. But could that be arranged from now on, that when there are lists of names in the document, then that is being submitted to the court reporters, then we do not have to do the spelling. So that is one issue.The second; once names are being spelt, it is, of course, important to reflect the names and their order as testified to by the witness and not to follow the names in the list if there are differences between the two. I am just making those two general observations. Yes, please.</p>

            <p>I believe it was around 2 p.m., we were at the Gitaka centre. Cyprian Nsengiyumva, who was a gendarme, and Nsengiyumva, alias Rutomvu, took her to Gitaka -- they found her at Joel Ndabukage's, where she was hiding. I asked them, "We were looking for that person for a long time, where did you find that person?" And the gendarme told me, "You cannot search for these people, I am a soldier I know how to go about it. I cannot tell you where I found her." And the people said, "Well, now we have found her." And when we were going out to kill her, the gendarme said, "Well, wait a minute, she promised to give me something," so that we went away and got to Nyarubuye at one Pascal's house -- Pascal Rwuhara's house, there were the furniture belonging to that lady. We took the furniture and got back to Gitaka. The furniture went to Nyabahiga -- at the gendarme's house. When we wanted to take it to Nyabahinga's house the soldier said -- when we got to Nyabahinga -- we wanted to go to Nyabahinga, but the soldier refused, the gendarme refused. So we stayed at Gitaka, and we took her behind the shops. We didn't go any further, and it was there that we killed her in the company of two of her children and another man who was at Ndabahinga's, he was called Nyugahingu; so that we killed four people on that occasion.</p>

            <p>I used to know him. I had seen him on two occasions. The first occasion at which I saw him was just before -- just after his wedding. He had come to visit his family while in our area. We were there, we watched his vehicle so that the children do not spoil the tyres. The second time was, I believe, in 1992. He had come to our area in Gitaka; he held a meeting there, and I believe on that occasion, he gave us berets of his party, PSD. We were very happy to join the party.

He had arrested him and he had taken him away to imprison him. On that day, I did not move. I believe it was on a Sunday, I was at home, and the other attackers came to see me and they said, "The minister is here, he is very serious." And I asked, "What has happened?" They told me, "Well, he has just arrested Karara." And then I told them, "Well, if you continue to move around like this, you may be arrested yourselves." And we went to a hill, and several moments after that I saw, from one kilometre away, a vehicle pass by Ndabukiye's house. We therefore went to the centre after that, and people told us that Karara had just been arrested, and they did not know what was going to happen to him.

            <p>I do not know the circumstances under which he died. Karegeya was one of the people sought after. He was very much sought after. I came to Gitaka, at that time Karara just came out of the Jita pub where he was having a drink. He was very sad, and he said, "My friend has been killed." I asked him, "Who is killed? Is it Karegeya?" He said, "Yes, it is Karegeya." I said that since he is dead we no longer had to look for him. He said that he was one of the most important people that actually had been killed. And I said, 'Who killed him?" And he said, "It was attackers that came from Buye."I said, "Didn't you bury him since he was your friend?" He said, "Yes, I did bury him." I said, "Well, well, that is the end of all of that." It was thus that I learnt that he was killed by people from Buye.</p>

            <p>You mean interest? You see, we in Rwanda only want people to plead guilty if they are guilty, and ask for pardon, because there are people who are wrongly accused. People are said to have played a role whilst one did not see them anywhere. Those people are falsely accused. So, you the Judges must seek the correct information to get to the truth. We are speaking the truth. We are not protecting anyone. We never do so. We speak the truth, the whole truth, because what happened is deplorable, and it's for that reason that if we are to struggle and show the reconciliation of Rwandans, we must speak the truth so that we know where to lay the blame.</p>

            <p>Yes, I can see that, but the problem is to determine whether Kanyoni is a nickname.

I do not know whom he is referring to, who he is talking about. I must know whether that person was called Simon Higiro. The person whom he is referring to and who was killed or who died at Gasharu, I don't know. I don't know who he was; I killed many people, I wouldn't know his name. Sometimes the person may have written the nickname without knowing other names, so it's possible that Simon, Simeon -- Simon Higiro and Kanyoni would be one in the same person; it is possible. </p>

            <p>It's true that if there are attackers who attack a cellule, the responsable should refer the matter to the higher authorities, but I described to you what we were like. Some authorities could do nothing against us. We could even attack them. Now, without even talking about the responsable, even the conseiller couldn't approach these people who were killing. They could do nothing, they could say nothing. For instance, Karara; there were young people who came to destroy houses in Gitaka, and when he tried to stop them they wanted to kill -- to beat him, and I told you that he was my neighbour, so they made him pay a fine of 30 litres of beer. So people became afraid, and the authorities remained silent in the face of all these crimes because they were afraid. </p>

            <p>I think that the killings stopped when the soldiers on the front line realised that they had lost the war. They fled and we members of the population fled. In fact, we perpetrated these killings in a record time. We had virtually finished in the month of May. There were a few survivors, and, to tell you the truth, when we left the country, when we fled the country there was no one else to be killed. And they told us something which I'll tell you. When the French came, someone came and told us, "Be careful. These French have sophisticated equipment which can track down criminals". So we got afraid and -- we got afraid and we stopped committing the crimes. There were some survivors who passed in front of us and we left them alone because we thought the French were going to track us down. And that is how the killings stopped. </p>

            <p>No, I have no clear recollection of that, but I believe it must have been last year. This document was put together last year. At the very beginning when I wrote down my confessions, this was in 1994; that I remember.</p>

            <p>In 1994 I was arrested by soldiers. The genocide survivors pointed me out and said he's -- that I am a criminal. That is how I was arrested. I was detained in the Gitarama prison, where I stayed for four years. When I got to Gisovu I felt it necessary to plead guilty and to make my confessions. That is when I started drafting my confessions. I think what is contained in this document reflects what I did, but it was later on, when I did some soul-searching based on the questions that I asked myself, I decided to confess. </p>

            <p>Perhaps he stayed in Gitaka, but among the people that I remember, I can only remember six persons, so that was a sizeable attack. Now, what I did was that I tried to observe people, I tried to remember people who took part in the attack. If I knew that he participated in the attack I would have said so. Perhaps he was in Gitaka but that he didn't come to the location at which we were and at which we killed the people that I talked about.</p>

            <p>I believe that Rwasibo is from Kayenzi. People could move from one secteur to the other for attacks. If somebody mentioned him as having been in Buye, perhaps he was there.

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>The instructions given us by the conseiller who set up that roadblock were given out when I was there. He asked the -- those in charge of the Kigesi cellule, that is the person called Pierre Damien Nsegureze <stage>(phonetic),</stage> to look for people of integrity to man that roadblock for the purpose of intercepting Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye in their flight from the RPF soldiers. So that a camp was created in Nyamuyeve <stage>(phonetic)</stage> to be able to list the names of the people concerned in order to prevent them from getting into Kibuye. The other reason of the roadblock was of course to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards, and if by any chance the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority.</p>

The children are not authorised to touch the women's machetes. A young adolescent would first of all buy a hoe and a machete, so that in our culture the machete is a symbol. It's a cultural symbol. Each and everyone does have a machete.</p>

            <p>Because then we could continue on Monday at two o'clock in the afternoon. Since the military trial is scheduled for the morning on Monday, we will then move on to the afternoon shift in the Ndindabahizi, in the afternoon. </p>

            <p>Certainly, Mr. President. Probably this is the right time for me to come up with some information concerning the rest of the proceedings.I believe we have heard 12 witnesses this week, and next week we could bring in five new witnesses. But for the week beginning on Monday, the 10th November to the 17th November, we believe that we will not be able to bring in witnesses, Mr. President, the reason being that certain witnesses, for professional reasons, cannot make the trip before the 17th, 17th of November. These are DD and the expert herself <stage>(sic).</stage> You wanted to know yesterday afternoon whether Mr. Ndindabahizi could not appear during the week of the 10th of November before the expert. We looked into this matter with Mr. Ndindabahizi, and Mr. Ndindabahizi believes that he should not testify before the expert. I believe that we share his opinion, sir. There are two reasons for that. The first reason is that it is a matter of pragmaticism <stage>(sic).</stage> We focussed a lot on the witnesses to date. I was not able to meet my client; I spent most of my time with the witnesses. Next week I will not be able to meet my client, either, because we will be in the courtroom, and we are not authorised to see them during the weekends.There is also a reason concerning the structure of the proceedings, and as a matter of logic, he will have to look at the whole structure of the trial and he will have to answer some questions from the experts. And we also believe that the order of appearance of the witnesses be maintained, and we beg that we continue after the 17th of November, after having heard witnesses next week, so that we'll have a week without witnesses, that is, the week running from the 10th of November. We should like to apologise for this. It was difficult for us to know that we would work with such speed. At the time we contacted the witnesses and the experts we didn't have all the information, and we didn't know the tempo at which this court would be working.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, indeed, there were many, many bars, around eight, I would say, but the road building operation, Kigali, at the road Kigali-Kibuye were, in fact, thought that those bars had to be pulled down, destroyed. At present there are only two of them remaining.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>Would it have been possible for an adult, during the period in question of April-May 1994, to hide behind those bars for one week without being seen or uncovered?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Now, to tell you the truth, even without talking about being able to hide for a week, there was nowhere one could hide. You can only be there for about five minutes, there were so many people roaming around. During that period we did not work much, but there were many people around, and behind those bars there were kitchens; there were latrines; and there were people doing different things; household chores; there were those who were peeling potatoes, and then there was a road behind the bars and those people could use those roads to go home or come to the bars. So there was nowhere to hide, as much. Moreover, during that period no Tutsi could go out from his or her hiding place without being seen, because even during the night all the pathways were monitored, there were the night patrols, nobody went to bed, that was the order of the day, and that was the purpose of preventing any soldier from RPF to come by and create a situation of insecurity. Such was the situation. In other words there was nowhere to hide behind those bars.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>Were there, apart from the bars, was there any possibility of hiding in the surrounding fields?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, there was a field in which there were various plots. There was Everest Ndawari, he had sold one of his plots. But as there was war the plot was not fenced and administered properly, whereas after the war a house was built or houses were built in those plots, so that there was really no place to hide.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>Were there any plantations or banana plantations sufficiently well grown so as to serve as hiding places?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>The banana fields were planted only when the houses were destroyed. If not, there were banana plantations here and there, so when one was at 100 metres away one could see what was happening in a given banana plantation, for example.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-marçais">
            <speaker>MR. MARÇAIS:</speaker>
            <p>So, a person hiding at about 35 metres away from the roadblock or around the roadblock could have been Tutsi, he could have been Tutsi and would be very quickly found. Is that correct?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Thirty-five meters is very short. That was not possible, because there were houses between the roadblock and the 35 metres you were talking about. You couldn't hide because there were buildings.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, sir, the bars, but a little bit further down there were houses where people lived, so that there were no places to hide.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>That is not possible either, sir, because everything that could have been distributed at the roadblock during my absence I would have my share kept for me because I was on duty there, and during that period it was no longer necessary to use machetes because the Tutsi were no longer there to be attacked. During that particular month machetes would have been useless. We did not need machetes during that period because we had a sufficient number of machetes. One can get machetes from anywhere, anybody's home. Even the people that went by the roadblock had their own machetes. So I did not hear anything about a possible distribution of machetes at that roadblock, sir.</p>

            <p>I would have heard about it if there was any reason for that. For example, if he, as a minister from that region, where he is very well known by one and all; for example people told him, well, "We are thirsty", and he accepted to buy them drinks, that I would have learned. For example, had he made a communication to describe the situation in Kigali and to proffer advice, I would have been in the know. But if he simply went through with his bodyguards I probably would not have heard about it, because people would not be particularly keen about coming to say that he had come and gone by, sir.</p>

            <p>That is a possibility, but those people were very important.

            <p>Well, people would not have gone through the pains of talking about it, because there were many authorities that went through, military, ministers, and during that period they moved their families towards Cyangugu or Bukavu and they came back.

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>The reason the roadblock was erected was because refugees who were moving would reach Kibuye, and there were too many of them in the city. To stop that flow of refugees, a roadblock was set up, a transit camp was set up to take down the names of people who were coming through the roadblock, such that vehicles could be attributed to them to transport them. In fact, that roadblock went up to ensure security in Kibuye town. Refugees who came on foot were led toward the camp. Those who were in vehicles were first controlled and then they were able to pass through. Vehicles were not allowed to park at Kibuye. Vehicles and people they were transporting continued on their road outside of the city of Kibuye.</p>

            <p>Regarding Sarambuye and Ruswgiza, they were killed well before, in April that is to say. Regarding the other two, they were killed afterwards. One of them was killed towards the end of May; whereas, Claudien was found in a house where he was hiding. Those who found him wanted to bring him to the bridge, but when they saw that his host was not at the house, they wanted to kill him. So they didn't bring him all the way to the roadblock where we were at. Rurakaza, his death only was known to us later on. He was killed in Josie cellule and not at Nyabahanga roadblock.</p>

            <p>In your testimony on Friday you were asked why the roadblock had been established, and you have testified as follows: "The other reason of the roadblock was, of course, to monitor the number of people going through the roadblock in vehicles to see whether they have ID cards and if, by any chance, the people at the roadblock had any doubts about their identity of such-and-such a person that was believed to be a member of the RPF or to be an Inkotanyi, that person was to be arrested and taken to the competent authority." I quote directly from the transcripts of 31 October 2003, Mr. Witness. Now, what you said on Friday is completely at variance with what you've told us this afternoon, isn't it, sir?</p>

            <p>No, there's no difference in the two statements. As I said, we would control people who were coming through in vehicles. We could not send them to the transit camp. We had to verify whether or not there were firearms and see -- make sure that everyone had their own identity card. But even the as we did that we did not discover anyone in an irregular situation. We controlled those persons who passed, and if there was someone who did not have an identity card, but if there were other people who could attest to the identity of that person, that person would be left to go through with the members of his or her family. That is how we worked.</p>

He brought that firearm from Kigali and he was assigned to that roadblock for control reasons. Other than that, there were no other weapons besides the ones I mentioned. Regarding the grenade that I mentioned, I only received it afterwards. From the start I did not have that grenade.</p>

            <p>So, if you came across a lorry load of RPF -- lorry full of RPF soldiers, people you refer to as Inkotanyi, with a couple of machetes, clubs, and one single grenade which you never used, how would you have apprehended them at that roadblock and handed them over to the competent authorities, sir? Can you help me with that? </p>

            <p>Indeed that was a problem that we always pointed out. Because if ever we were taken by surprise we would be decimated or risk that. We spoke of that problem to the gendarmery authorities who promised to bring us weapons. But up until the point the roadblock was dismantled, those were not brought to us, but we kept working at that roadblock because we were given an order to do so.</p>

            <p>So you were sacrificial lambs, were you, sir, stationed at the roadblock with no arms and asked to stop RPF and Inkotanyi from going past, is that your testimony, sir, civilians like yourself armed with clubs; and you lived to tell the story, did you not, sir?</p>

            <p>It is true, at that time we had no choice, we could not refuse to go to the roadblocks. We were under constraints, even if we didn't want to go, and we were worried if we refused to go we would risk being called accomplices of the Inkotanyi. Therefore we were compelled. We had to go to the roadblock. Even during the night nobody slept. They had to participate in night patrols. People were not authorised to go home to sleep. These were orders, hence we could not do things differently.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. Witness, good afternoon. I have a few questions. You testified that -- correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I understood you to say -- that there was no need for the Accused to come and distribute machetes because by the time the Tutsi had been killed and there was no need for these machetes. In any case, all those present had their own machetes. My question is, if there was no need for these machetes, why were you armed with clubs, machetes, a gun, and a grenade?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>I must say that if it were necessary to distribute machetes, they would have been distributed before, that is when there were still attacks on Tutsi groups. I'm saying that that period, the distribution of machetes could have been justified, but in June there was no Tutsi resistance, as such, and even those Tutsis alive were hiding so that we didn't need machetes anymore, because we had enough machetes. Had we needed machetes, we would have used the machetes we had.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-bossa">
            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>I have a question. In what capacity you were at this roadblock? Why were you called up and why did you accept to come to the roadblock?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>We were ordered to remain at the roadblock to ensure that those people who were running away, either on foot to settle elsewhere, were denied access to Kibuye city. So we had established a transit camp where people were identified and counted and lorries were designated to take these people across Kibuye city, one. And two -- the second reason for the roadblock was to monitor the vehicles who came through to see if there were anybody, there were any people on those vehicles that could jeopardise security in Kibuye city. It's another reason why we were ordered to stay at the roadblock, because a refusal would be tantamount to seeking punishment.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-bossa">
            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>My question is you - you, the people who were ordered, who were you and why were you ordered, in preference to other people. Like you, for instance, there must have been very many people in the village who could have done the same type of work.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, when the roadblock was set up the conseillé instructed those in charge to look for people with integrity that were not going to take any property from the refugees. So there was the person in charge who was to select certain people. It was up to him to choose this and not that, because he knew how this and that behaved, so that the person selected was due to -- bound to participate in the manning of the roadblock.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>No, not at all. I was one of the people among the population. In our area we didn't have many Interahamwe. There were people who said that they belonged to the MRND party, but Interahamwe, they were the youth wing of the MRND party. As far as I'm concerned, I was not even a member of the MRND. As a matter of fact, I was not a member of any political party for that matter. I couldn't, therefore, have been called an Interahamwe.</p>

Because I asked for a grenade, I asked for a grenade just to protect myself, personally. This is all I can say as far as that question is concerned, sir.</p>

            <p>Well, that very morning following our discussions, that is, my discussion with Ndindabahizi, we went to the commune to check on that particular case, and if my memory serves me right, we reviewed that case together.

He told me the name of the fellow, and he told me why, in one or two words, and told me to continue checking on that case. And we went together to the communal office, and I did take note of the fact that the fellow was there. This is what I learned. But to tell you precisely what he told me, I believe I may make some mistakes, but the general picture is that.</p>

And during that discussion, I did not -- I cannot remember whether it was with Ndindabahizi that went to that fellow, but I interviewed that fellow who was in jail, and he told me what happened, and that brought me to my first decisions, subsequently.</p>

            <p>Mr. Witness, do you remember when this episode took place? You see, now it was put to you that it was in June and you said yes, but do you remember, yourself, when this happened? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>The precise date, I cannot tell. This is why I put it in the month of June. It was June, during June, towards the end of June. This is all I can remember. As far as the precise date is concerned, I really have doubts about it. I cannot confirm it here, sir.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>The question I wanted to put to you is as follows. At the time, at the time the country was overwhelmed with killers, how could one suspect or accuse anyone of genocide at that time?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that is a rather delicate question. As you say, the country was engulfed by killers. But at that time, too, people were being arrested. People were being jailed and released by their own people or others. And people were put in jail, and their case files were at the prosecutor's office, so that that was chaos. So, all the same, when you have somebody who supports you, as Ndindabahizi, for example, he says, well, he's intervening, he's a minister, he's asking questions, and when his prosecutor is not still -- I personally was directly involved in the case. So that to a certain extent I am covered. There was prosecution, I did say so. Even by carrying out the investigations, it would not be easy to carry on the case. That was why I couldn't do so, but I attempted to carry out the investigation, and that is what I did. It was possible that was what I did. Now, to complement that, I should say that once the population is mobilised, that it points its fingers at somebody. That somebody must be arrested because somebody is accused by a section of the population. There were arrests, it is what we said. When there are grounds, one has reason to carry out investigations and, of course, the case was very difficult to investigate wholly. But in this particular case, even if I had called people who came, I was not able to carry out the investigation in full because -- but I cannot give you a clear-cut answer because the situation was such that people were careful. I was not able to exhaust the case, but I did attempt to do so. This is all.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you. Now, you said that you saw Emmanuel Ndindabahizi on that very date we are referring to. For how long did he stay with you?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, it was very short. At my house, it was early in the morning, and, first of all, I had to go and get him at his house. There was an appointment. I went to see him, and at the time he came to see me. If I am with Ndindabahizi at the commune, I would tell him that Ndindabo was not there. And we took the decision to go and get him at Bwakira. I could not go along with him. I stayed in Kibuye. So throughout that period, and perhaps the time we talked about the arrest, et cetera, et cetera -- that is, by the end of the morning it was all over. We didn't stay together all the time. We left, and I went to the communal office. He joined me there, and he realised that the fellow I was looking for was not there, so we decided to go and get him. That was by the end of the morning -- or in the morning.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>They were roadblocks that were set up by groups of people who were officially supposed to monitor RPF infiltration. That was the main purpose why they were -- that was why they were on the main thoroughfare, junctions and streets. But later on it was realised that those were locations or sites for the massacre of people.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>The mounting of the roadblocks was done by the Bihiditero <stage>(phonetic).</stage> Those were mobile units. And those attacks -- those attacks were carried out by groups who couldn't be controlled by the authorities, who couldn't be monitored by the authorities.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>To my knowledge, in Kibuye there was no determined plan. We just saw the roadblocks being set up progressively. There was one set up here and then another and another until such a time as they sort of formed a complete network, so that they were being mounted progressively. As far as I am concerned, there was no plan there set up for their set-up.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>It was a roadblock that was mounted, but I can't remember the date. It was May, June, following the establishment of a refugee -- a displaced people camp. That had been established on a hill overlooking the river. The roadblock was to block the out <stage>(sic)</stage> of the people from that area to the city, because there was an emergency evacuation plan established, so that there was a plan and a roadblock to stop them from leaving the camp. So that, in a nutshell, it was a roadblock at the exit of the camp.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Witness. Witness, very quickly, another topic. At what day, as far as your recollection -- you can recollect, the massacres at Kibuye and the Kibuye stadium, at what date did they take place?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>The massacres at the church -- you are referring to also the Saint Jean Home, because it's the same location -- took place on a Sunday morning, on the 17th of April. The massacre of the Gatwaro stadium took place the following day, on the 18th, in the evening, so that it was on the 18th of April, sir.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>I was at Kibuye. To be more precise, the massacres -- during the massacres at the church, which took place during the morning, I know that people gathered at a roundabout. I went there to discourage them. We quarrelled, it didn't work, so that I took refuge at the communal office, myself. So that I was at the commune office when the massacres started to take place. As far as the Gatwaro massacres took place, in the evening, when I was at home.</p>

            <p>I have just told you that the massacres took place when I was at the communal office, so I didn't take part in that massacre. I did not witness side events. I was at home during the massacres, at the communal office, too.</p>

            <p>Where did the killers come from?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Regarding their identity, in general, there was a group known as Wakiga <stage>(sic),</stage> the people from the hills, the mountains, who mostly came from Rutsiro, from the neighbouring commune of Gisyeni, Kayove, Abakiga. They are called Abakiga, and they are a very powerful group. There were also people from Kibuye itself with the gendarmes, some elements from the gendarmerie, other people in the population from Kibuye, these Abakiga. That is how I was able to distinguish the group of killers at those two places. That is to say, the Saint Jean Home and church, and the Gatwaro stadium.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Did those killers remain in Kibuye for some time or did they just stay long enough to perpetrate the crime and then leave?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>They came and went. I wasn't there. Perhaps some stayed there, but in general it was just a movement we saw from the road. It was a daily movement. So they stayed for some time, a rather long time, in fact, because -- so, it was a movement from May to June. It was continuous, if you will. People coming from Kibuye didn't go elsewhere, and the gendarmes remained.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>I don't know if they were officially being hosted by someone, but they stayed in some empty buildings uninhabited, in the primary school, for example, because at that time there were no studies. But when classes were open, they left that place, the primary school in Kibuye. There was another centre, an agricultural training centre, called SAF, which is in a little valley past the primary school. Those buildings were also occupied and damaged. I also believe that some of them stayed at the buildings of the tribunal -- court of first instance. But they found a place to stay, at any rate.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>That's difficult to say. I was not in a camp where they were. I didn't really see them. But I know that at each place where they perpetrated attacks, the attack was followed by looting, especially at the church and the Saint Jean Home. There were supplies there. Those were given by Caritas to be used to feed hungry people in the commune, and they were stocked at the Catholic Church, where the attacks took place. Those supplies were completed looted. And of course they didn't loot to sell it; they used it. People who took refuge at the church and at the stadium also had brought some of their cattle with them. Well, that was looted as well. So, in part, they used these kinds of things to feed themselves. I think mostly it came from things that they looted, therefore.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Last question. Did people try to oppose these killers? Did they try to stop them from committing these crimes?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>To be frank, there was no opposition in Kibuye, not manifestly speaking. There were attempts on the parts of some individuals, but there were no groups, if you will, of people to oppose these killers. Some individuals tried to avoid the massacres taking place. I can give you some names, if you wish. I know the area commander of Kibuye attempted to put up a fight against these massacres. Other people came to see me. They asked for my advice on how to stop these. They asked me to find a way to stop the massacres. These people took initiative, if you will, to stop the massacres. Earlier I spoke about a quarrel that I had at a roundabout with the killers. And it was a fight. I had to take refuge at the communal office because of that quarrel. So there were some confrontations or opposition, but it wasn't manifestly organised, if you will, into groups. It was just individual attempts, and isolated cases, if you will.</p>

            <p>I did see that there were people there. They were surrounded; they were from Gitesi in Kibuye secteur. They had attempted to seek shelter at a parish there, a Presbyterian parish there. I didn't have any means to protect them, and I decided to evacuate part of them, some of the children and elderly. I took them in my car, and I brought them to Kibuye. At that time we had set up a camp for displaced persons in Kibuye at the Gatwaro stadium. And it was semi-guarded, so I brought them there hoping to get some help to keep them out of harm's way, if you will. That is what I did. Now, another part remained there. I assigned a police officer to them to escort them to Kibuye.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I know that I was in Gitesi secteur where Gasharu is, I was at the secteur office. I organised a meeting there with the population in April, around the 30th, I believe, or on the 30th. So I think it is the 30th of April, from the information that I have. I organised a meeting of the population at that place. So I was at Gasharu in Gitesi secteur where Gasharu is, but I don't really see clearly the exact borders, if you will, of the cellule, therefore I can't tell you if I was exactly there.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>It was at the end of the month of April, the 30th, and, as you see, this is when the massacres were taking place, killings were taking place. I was attempting to see if it was possible to stop the massacres. It followed another communal meeting that I held on the 27th or 29th of April, where we tried to do everything possible to dissuade the population from perpetrating those massacres, to try to confront the criminals. That was the first secteur meeting that I had in the secteurs. I started with Gitesi secteur. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, those meetings, were they a success?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, in general the population was not entirely in agreement with the massacres. People were opposed to them, but they didn't have support. We didn't know what to do. So in the meetings you would find people who supported us, who understood. And furthermore, killers were asking for forgiveness and saying that they were guilty.So, yes, it should be considered a success. When you organise such a meeting, after that there are counter-meetings, groups of people who influence the population. And there is the radio stations like the RTLM who continues with propaganda, and in the end the population changes opinion. For those who were discouraged, think they have no support, and they find support in the RTLM and in other venues. That was the situation that we observed.So there wasn't a big success, because the massacres continued in some way, if you will, but by talking with the population and seeing their warm welcome and their enthusiasm, normally we should have achieved tangible results. </p>

It was organised at the level of prisons, and even after the Gacaca, the manner that Gacacas were organised at the level of cellules and secteurs according to the law, was supposed to be adapted to the various detainees.Now, it was such practices as ordained by the law that we call the Gacacas organised by the detainees.

            <p>Yes, I had ordered or instructed him to look for that person because I knew that person was in Kibuye. I knew about his movements and was to look for him, so that I had instructed the policeman to look for him. </p>

            <p>Well, his family, when he left his native area, that is Gasharu, they came and he remained at the Gatwaro stadium. Part of his family, his wife and his children, came -- went to my house, that is my parents' house. His wife -- well, he was a good brother of mine, so his wife is my sister. So that once I -- when I went back home I saw that his wife and children were there, and they told me that he was at the stadium, so I looked for him, I began to look for him. The fellow went twice, and it was after that that he was found. This is how he came to my house. </p>

            <p>The fact that he went to the stadium to look for him at the stadium, the very precise location I cannot tell you, but he found him at the stadium, got him from the stadium. He got information from the people at the stadium, some people were called and they said "We're looking for so-and-so", and that person, the fellow, came, presented himself, and he was met.</p>

            <p>Well, he stayed at my house up to the month of May. In May the situation had changed. There was a lot of danger, and I decided to send him out to Zaire.

            <p>Absolutely. If he is there at my house and we are being suspected of keeping Tutsi, could he just come in broad daylight? No, he would try to hide from people, and he will hide. During the day he will behave as though he was a gardener in the garden, but he would avoid people. And at the house he tried to hide himself somehow or the other, disguised. He wasn't out there to be seen. I was being attacked from keeping people or suspected of keeping people, so he had to hide.</p>

            <p>Why should I invite him? To expose him and to get involved? No. To give me any contributions? No. I didn't think he was interested or should be interested or involved. That would be a manner of exposing him, yet again. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>It's impossible, so the answer is no. You invite a person because you need his or her contribution, and they'll probably have something to do with the discussions. This is a person who was hiding, who was being sought after, and he had to be sent off to Zaire. I cannot expose him. He couldn't even leave the area. In the sitting room he wouldn't show up.

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Barayata is a person who at a given period of time was working as a Gitesi police inspector. He left Gitesi because he quarrelled about his behaviour, and I helped, and he was posted to the Kibuye prosecutor's office. He was at the prosecutor's office, I had no special relationship with him. My relationship with him was rather strained, so that we didn't have any contact as such, not to speak of visits.</p>

            <p>Well, that question is a broad, broad question, but in a nutshell, in a nutshell, I would say that I had no reason to run away. On the one hand the problems of security that one talked about were there. It was during the period of Opération Turquoise, Operation Turquoise, during which French were involved, and it was necessary to resolve such security problems that were said to be there.The other reason was that the very principle of running away and the operation that went as far as Congo, well, the principle I rejected. The reasons for the operations, those were political reasons with which I disagreed. I believe that these were the two reasons why I did not run away. </p>

            <p>All right. But if that is the case, we can see that even if the Chamber closes down for the day a bit earlier this week, we will still have no problems in finalising the available witnesses. And then we are aware of the situation with the three remaining ones, that is DD, the expert and the Accused. Yes. </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>In fact, you had four days testimony in the Niyitegeka case; that is the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th of June 2002 was centred almost exclusively on this meeting; was it not?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, it would be difficult to give you a number, but I think that that question was put to me in the affair I spoke about earlier. But the room that we're in, in any case, was full, so I would say 100 or so people. The room was full, so I would say 100 or so, but I don't know the exact capacity of that room.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, if it was simultaneous, I wouldn't know because I was in the room itself. All that I can confirm is that I listened to a broadcasted tape on Radio Rwanda, so obviously that was afterward.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>No. The meeting was on the 3rd of May and, as we said before, there were massacres. Even in April, there were massacres, and those massacres targeted mostly Tutsi persons, so those persons could not have been there. So, if that meeting took place, it means that it was a hidden, or secret, rather, meeting. So, no, in answer to your question, I did not see any.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>They were targeted. What people were saying at that time was that they were considered as accomplices of the RPF. It was a way of targeting them and the members of the RPF -- as members of the RPF.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I believe that first he spoke of the security situation in the préfecture, and that was mostly what he spoke of. If he said that all of the population was behind the government, it's possible, but I cannot confirm that for you here. I don't have the minutes, if you will, to that meeting.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>I didn't see it like that personally, but according to what was being said at the time, in general, what people were saying was that, indeed, but my personal opinion was not that.

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>What you're saying, Mr. Witness, is that you understood that Rwandans in general would interpret the word "Inkotanyi" to refer to all Tutsi who inhabited Rwanda, and who were outside. Is that what you're saying?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, that's what I said, but I specified that was a general idea, that doesn't include everyone, and it certainly does not include me. That is not how I saw things, but that was the general idea, that was what was being heard. That is what people in general understood by -- in that vocabulary.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Inkotanyi, normally, is the RPF with its armed wing, and they were fighting on the war front. That's what I understand by Inkotanyi. Others, you don't call them Inkotanyi. Those who were targeted within were more accomplices of the Inkotanyi, but not Inkotanyi.</p>

            <p>Mr. President, I have an objection, an objection to this question. I did not, in my examination-in-chief, talk about what was said at that meeting of 3rd May. I didn't speak of it at all. Furthermore, everything regarding that meeting of 3 May was withdrawn from the indictment; it was Article 24 in the indictment. Mr. Ndindabahizi is not being indicted for participating in that meeting. We've been speaking about it for 20 minutes. I did not bring up this issue in my examination-in-chief, and I think that the Prosecutor would do well to move on to a new subject.</p>

            <p>Your Honour, the 3rd of May meeting was a subject of a long discussion by our expert Alison Des Forges and it is contained in her expert report. Secondly, this very witness was present at that meeting and as we will go further, Your Honour, it will show that even the Accused person was present at that meeting, so we will tie up what the prime minister said and what the -- our expert says in the general context of proof of our case. So, it is my humble submission, Your Honour, that this meeting is very relevant to our case and, actually, the witness alluded to it in his testimony, and we said, further, under Rule 90 <stage>(G)</stage> a party cross-examining a witness has a <stage>(inaudible)</stage> or right to raise issues which go to the credibility of the witness, and also to issues that advance the case of that party. So, for those reasons, Your Honour, I submit that Mr. Besnier's objection should be overruled.</p>

            <p>So, Mr. Witness, my question was that you have testified that as of 3rd May '94, there were no Inkotanyi or RPF soldiers in Kibuye, but some bourgmestres raised the issue that there were attacks in the Bisesero area made by RPF soldiers. Now, how do you explain this phenomenon, if you can call it that?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>It is difficult for me to explain what people said, what someone else said, especially the Gisovu and Gishyita bourgmestres. There were people who were extremists, and who talk of Tutsi and Inkotanyi in one breath. In general, the terms that were used, he spoke of Inkotanyi in Gishyita, perhaps in order to give more strength to his argument to justify what happened in Gishyita, but what was really said, or used, rather, was accomplices, but I'm sure in Gishyita there were no Inkotanyi. So, if he spoke of Inkotanyi in Gishyita, there were none; and I even spoke of this in the trial that you mentioned earlier.</p>

To begin with, to give you a bird's eye view of the statement, at this time I cannot say -- I cannot confirm that it was a message from the PSD or just a stance he was listing, vis-à-vis an intervention just made before him by one of the participants. I do remember that there was someone that was at the meeting that raised a question that tended to point out the PSD as an RPF agent, and that the people -- members of that party were not credible. That was a question they put to the prime minister, and I don't know whether it was because of that question that he took the floor. But Ndindabahizi did take the floor to show and justify that the PSD was not an RPF agent, and that the members of the PSD should not be considered as RPF accomplices, and that they are -- they were in the government, just like the others, who were not RPF. It was along those lines that I understood his statement, and it was thus that I could interpret what he said. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, sir. The issue is when we were answering questions and when we were summarising the statements made, those lines were included. They were recorded in the statements, but they do not totally reflect my understanding of the statement made by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. If I were to explain this, sir, I do remember that he was there. There was a statement made by Jean Rwabukwisi, who attacked the party openly, and its members, at the meeting, and that had to be dealt with. He therefore talked about the PSD that was considered as pro-RPF, but that they did not attack the government. That means that they were not pro-RPF. So this is the manner in which I wanted to put it. It was a position typed on a statement that was made at that meeting. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>

            <p>No, Mr. President, the name was one of the participants in the meeting, Rwabukwisi, Jean. He is a businessman who stood up and pointed at the PSD party and its members as not being credible, and that -- that the RPF was still present at the conference, thanks to the PSD. So that's -- in reacting to that statement, Ndindabahizi took the floor. This is why <stage>(sic)</stage> I interpret his intervention. </p>

I do remember this person speaking, pointing at the PSD and its members. I do remember Ndindabahizi's statement. I am saying that I do not quite remember whether he made a statement as a specific statement of the PSD, or whether he was reacting to that question. But in my mind, in fact, what I understand, I believe that it was in reaction to that statement. This is why I am saying that he took the floor and explained PSD's position vis-à-vis that person that had made the statement and vis-à-vis the government in place. </p>

            <p>On page 12, Mr. Witness, there is the paragraph which is, "The RPF claimed that the Rwandan Government had prevented them from returning to their mother-land. It has now become clear that this is a lie because Rwanda has never prevented them from returning home. The RPF also claimed that there is no democracy and when Rwanda accepted to organize elections so that the will of the majority may be shown through democracy, the RPF was at a loss."

            <p>Is it possible to find in this passage all the statements, Raubo Kizi's and the others? I see that it's a message, but that was a reaction of one of the participants that pointed to the PSD.

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Your Honour. That is what I intended to do.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>And then we will look at other parts of this document later on. So this, you say -- this is a speech, you say.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>That's correct. Now, so far as the occasion of the statement is concerned, I do not know whether it is a reaction to an intervention or simply a message. All I know is that Ndindabahizi spoke and that a question was raised along those lines. This is all I can say. Now, as to the contents of the context of the first paragraph, that is what I said, because I confirm that at his intervention he wanted to show that the PSD was not an accomplice of the RPF and it was the government and that was a testament to the fact that it was not of the RPF, so that that is the line along which I wanted to interpret the statement he had made.</p>
          </sp>
          <stage>BY MR. KAPAYA:Q. 	The second paragraph reads, "The RPF had intended to reject negotiations. It resumed hostilities after killing the President of the Republic. Documents were found with its members which showed how the war in 1993 and that of early 1994 were planned. At that time, we Rwandans had put our hopes in the Arusha Peace Accords, they were planning and preparing a war to exterminate us." Did he or did he not say this?</stage>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>I say that this is a continuation of the first paragraph and I believe that the one who summarised the statement did not imagine the words. It is a summary made by somebody, and I cannot call that into question as to what he has written, this person who made a summary.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>The third one reads, "They secured accomplices in the main political parties and caused these parties to split. It has become clear that the RPF never wanted power sharing but rather wanted all the power for itself. During war preparations, the combatants had taken up war hero names so that outsiders would not recognize them if they called each other." Did he say this, the reference to Inkotanyi?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>What does panégyrique in French mean? This is part of the statement. It is a part of a statement that describes the RPF, and eliciting as tenants vis-a-vis the RPF. I don't know whether I can say, or if he said or he did not say. All I can say is that this is an excerpt of his statement. That is all.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Okay. The third one reads, "The RPF wanted the Rwanda government to remain paralysed from December 1993 up to the time when it would seize power. In the meantime however, it would be making preparations to take over the country. This became clear through the previous government." Mr. Witness, did Mr. Ndindabahizi say or did he not say these words, and, if so, in what context? If you can recall, tell us you recall; if you don't, say you don't.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, so far as I'm concerned, the answer is the same as to the one I offered earlier on concerning the other paragraphs. This is a political speech and whether they are political statements by Ndindabahizi, I do not have the entire texts with me or in my head. All that I can say is that he made a statement, the statements which I commented on, and this is only a summary of a statement made in the course of the discussions that took place at a meeting and, of course, it is part and parcel of the statement, so that I'm not denying that he did not make a statement in the course of that meeting.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>But do you remember actually now what he said, Mr. Witness? When the Prosecutor is now putting these sections to you, he wants to know whether he said it or not. That is the first issue, and are you able to remember whether he said it or not?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Sentence per sentence? Is that what you mean, Mr. President? It's a bit difficult for me. Do you mean sentence per sentence if this indeed was the statement of someone? That seems difficult, but if you mean the general idea that came out of it, to say that it was the exact statement he made when this is a summary, I don't know, but I do know that this was broadcast over radio. You could even see tapes that you probably have, console tapes that you probably have, but to confirm whether or not this summary is complete and whether or not there are mistakes, I'm not in a position to guarantee that.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>The other paragraph reads, "The RPF has now become too confident about its strength. It has openly stated that it wants a Ministry for Tutsis, that of Justice. He called upon the PSD party members to join others in fighting for the country's security, even if many accomplices were from their party. This was also the case in many other parties, which did not mean that these parties would stop working. He called upon Abakombozi, PSD party members, to register for civil defence in big numbers." Do you recall that summary?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>First, he did speak of accomplices within the party. That the youth wing would join the civil defence, that, too, he underscored.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>And finally, it reads -- the statement is, "In ending the PSD party's message, Minister Ndindabahizi called upon members of the population to point out early enough any leader who might lead them astray because it was now clear which side each of them supported, between the RPF and the Rwandan people's government."

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>In fact, what is underscored here, to denounce authorities who were responsible, that is why I was against this. This is a reaction to a question that was asked. The question underscored this aspect, that there were authorities who were not credible, who were not good people within the population.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>No, to say that the PSD -- this PSD situation with regard to the RPF is clear, I don't agree. The PSD never worked for the RPF as the population said it did. However, it is true this position was similar than the RPF. That's why people said that the PSD was working for the RPF, but by saying that they support the transitional government, that is what he wanted to say, by saying that they are in the government, they work in the Abatabazi government.</p>

            <p>So the message is that formerly the RPF supported -- the PSD supported the RPF, but now it's changed its position, it's not supporting the RPF government, isn't that the position?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>There is a position that I don't understand. There is one position and name you give to one party, and that I explained. The party was in the government even before the RPF came into the country, but the people called them accomplices. What I am sure of -- and I was a member of the party -- is that we did not work for the RPF, but we were assimilated as doing so. We always worked in the government within the country. That is why that he takes this position, to show that the RPF, and not PSD members, are working for -- as accomplices of the RPF.</p>

            <p>Okay, why don't you ask that question? It's a leave question, and its credibility, but we see the need now to go to the main portions of the examination-in-chief. Did you get the question from the Prosecutor, Mr. Witness? We are now dealing with the 16th of May meeting briefly. So what is your question?</p>

            <p>The relevance, Your Honour, is that the person who I'm asking the witness to respond to, if it was the president of the republic and whatever he said represented policy of the government generally. Now, the government is one where Mr. Ndindabahizi and this witness, and -- sorry, Mr. Ndindabahizi said, so it's important to explain the policy in which the accused person said it, and the question actually pertains to any issue which -- when we get the witness's response, you will see the relevance of it, Your Honour.</p>

No monitoring was done to see how it was being conducted. What we do know, however, is that those roadblocks were being manned by authorities either of the national or local level, so it's part of the propaganda that was going on during that period.</p>

            <p>No, I'm going to read the passages you indicated. It is on page 3, the last part of the page. "The meeting noted that in general there was suspicion among the ethnic groups because of criminal acts committed in the neighbouring communes of Gitesi, to the extent that the Gitesi commune, itself, was affected by such criminal acts. Secondly, the meeting took note of the fact that the bourgmestre, in seeking assistance and securing assistance from the gendarmerie and the communal police force members, may continue to intervene wherever the situation became difficult, so that if any individual were to be arrested because of such acts, that that individual be severely punished. Thirdly, the meeting noted that each conseiller in his or her sector should continue to proffer counsel for the purpose of preventing criminal acts. 4. The meeting noted that the curfew instituted as from 18 hours to 06 hours in the morning was necessary. During that period, on the thoroughfares that lead to the city, roadblocks should be erected, night patrols within the city must be ensured by the gendarme, but in the rural areas where such patrols had already begun and where people are co-operating without any problems, that night patrols must continue."Now, will I go on? </p>

            <p>Now, Mr. Witness, here reference is made to the erection of roadblocks in what you just read out, and we had the impression, listening to you a couple of minutes ago, that there were no roadblocks erected at the local level.</p>

            <p>Yes, there were none, sir, so that I believe that in this passage we are talking about roadblocks that lead to the city. In other words, we should control, monitor the movement of people going into town so that the propaganda -- I mean, the propaganda comes in force so that movement towards the city should be monitored, so that these roadblocks are gendarmerie roadblocks. This is why we are saying that the patrols are not initiated by the population, but rather by the gendarmerie. This is what came out of the meeting of the 11th. There were no roadblocks in any sectours in the countryside. This is what I could say concerning the question put to me.</p>

            <p>The question that I had put to you, Mr. Witness, was whether roadblocks were not part and parcel of the civil defence programme, that is the defence that people were asked by authorities to observe, themselves. Now, in the course of doing that, they were required to build roadblocks. Now, were roadblocks not within the sanction of the state, the authority as part and parcel of the civil defence programme?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Very well, very well. Now, let me try and answer that question, Mr. President. Now, that was the situation prevailing as at 11th of April that emanated from the security situation prevailing in the commune. The security situation is reflected in this resumè, this summary, the preamble section in the body of the text. Of course, the entire text is not translated, but all the stages are reflected. Now, these are only the conclusions adopted by the assembly in view of the situation that obtained. Now, there was a civil defence programme that was instituted, recommended by the government, and that civil defence programme was as a result of instructions from the prime minister, who wrote the instructions and communicated them. Now, if you look at the meeting of 3rd of May, it was there that the idea of a civil defence program was communicated. It was at that time that the idea was communicated. Now, if you want to link the fact of the 11th of April and 3rd of May, I believe that they are not related. And the civil defence program, it is explained in the decision of the prime minister and the instruction of the minister of the Interior, it was communicated, it was an instruction -- we know it was an instruction and we knew it. It was an instruction from the month of May and not April, so these are two different things, and in the civil defence program there was no instruction concerning roadblocks. It was rather one intended to train young people thoroughly so they could support the army and the defence of the country in the event of Inkotanyi attacks in the area. The instruction concerning the training of these people, these young people, only started after the instruction and in Gitesi started in June. You can see this summary. There is another summary that talks about the civil defence program and that is after the 13th of May. You should have that summary. How did we react to it? That was the one of 13th of May. That was the decision, the meeting to discuss the decisions and instructions of the Prime Minister. That is what I can say regarding this question regarding the civil defence program and the setting up of the roadblocks.</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Yesterday, when learned counsel was leading you on this issue, he asked you the following question and this is your response. "Now, did authorities mount those roadblocks? Was there a plan for the setting up of roadblocks in Kibuye?" Answer: "To my knowledge, in Kibuye there was no determined plan. We just saw the roadblocks being set up progressively. There was no -- there was one set up here and then another and another until such a time that it sort of formed a complete network." Is that what you say?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. The answer to that question is still valid even at this time. I believe that if you are referring to the decision to erect roadblocks at the entrance of the city, that wasn't part of the gendarmerie. We requested that roadblocks be set up there. Now, you are asking about the roadblocks made by the population that were mounted here and there in the area, so that once again -- perhaps, I see that you have a document. What the problem of roadblocks, I looked at it properly in the course of a meeting because the form of barriers of the roadblocks was a problem. There was no program of erection here and there and getting the population to set them up. I am not denying that there was a campaign launched by certain authorities, certain parts of the media to set up roadblocks, that is a matter of fact, but to say that this and that authority decided that roadblocks be set up and manned in such-and-such a manner, that is not true. This is what I said yesterday and this is what I'm still maintaining.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Now, let me come back to the answer. I know, and I'm not denying, that some of the authorities, some of them supported and did push for the setting up of the check points, the roadblocks, and when there were crimes committed at those roadblocks, that generated a problem, so far as I'm concerned, at any rate, and I, particularly, looked into the problem on the occasion of the meeting of the committee, such as the meeting of the 11th, because that was a problem, a real problem that was there, and that was a matter of fact.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Now, before I answer that question, Mr. President, could I give you background to clarify these questions, the preceding questions especially, as regards the said incompatibility or otherwise or the replacement level of the party or at regional level? This will allow me to make things much clearer, Mr. President. Very well. Now, what happened, as I said yesterday, was that initially when PSD was created in '91 it was run by a member, or by a provisional committee; that is, somebody was appointed as president or chairman, secretary, et cetera, et cetera. That was how it happened, and after the members became many, there was a structure put to the party and organs were elected, party organs, as I said yesterday. At regional level, indeed, the person who was the founding member was running the party at the level of the region up to 1992 or 1993, but somewhere in 1992 there were regional elections, and the elected committee was established and the chairman was Ndindabahizi. Now, the person that was in the regional committee, the person whose name you showed me who was the chairman of the party during the interim period, was still on the committee, but not at the level of chairman after the elections -- after the elections. So that has nothing to do with the appointment as MP. That was after the Arusha Accords were signed in 1993. It was then that the parties organised themselves to appoint those that want to represent them in the parliament in transitional -- the interim parliament. That was 1993 and 1994. That should be set apart. Now, coming back to the issue that was just raised as to who replaced him -- I think that was the question, who replaced him at the level of the parliament as MP. Now, as I explained yesterday, the appointment of this replacement -- and he took part in it -- it was between the chairman of the party at regional level and the person whose name you showed me who was the vice chairman. This is why he went to see Bwakira, and at that time -- let me explain, Mr. President. Before and during the transitional parliament that was programmed with the RPF, it was 11 members, but with the new parliament without the RPF, we had 13 members. Now, I do not see why you are saying it was a matter of course or they wanted to replace him. He was replaced, but there were members to be added to the list. Now, the question as to why he was replaced, you didn't ask. You shouldn't put it to me. Put it to those people who made sure that the name of the person was on the final list. These are the explanations I wanted to offer, Mr. President. Thank you.</p>

            <p>The chairman cannot have any right of ratifying. It was a party appointment. It had nothing to do with the other parties or the government. It was not a ratification process. There was no such step. It was a matter for the party. </p>

            <p>No, no, no. We are talking about procedures. As far as the appointment of MPs are concerned, that never goes to the prime minister or the president of the republic, that is a decision that is made within the party, and that is all, full stop. That is why, if the president were to ratify or confirm, the parliament would have been there a long time ago; it is because it's the parties that appoint their members. Now, indeed, my appointment was not made by a committee. The situation, the conjuncture was impossible. That is why there was consultation between two party leaders at that level.</p>

            <p>Well, that is a question that I would like to dwell on, if I may. That is always a matter of speculation and interpretation, and you should allow me time to explain this. Now I am -- and I explained the functions that I performed from 1990 to 1994 -- now, during that period of time the government of Rwanda was to be seen -- could have been seen in four ways. There was the MRND government, and up to '91 there was a government in which you had only two political parties that only was there for three months in 1991, and now you have a government where there is an agreement between political parties where now we have four, five parties within that government, that is, from 1991 to 1993. Now, these political parties that took part in that government of the MRND, for example, they were there with their own identities as parties, they were there upon agreement with the government. Now, these are three governments, and I was in there, I performed my functions, and nothing ever changed. Now, I do not know whether the functions I had were absolutely related to the policies of those governments. If not, I should have been changed each and every time the government changes. Whereas in those governments the political parties that agreed to run the country -- and those political parties did not abandon their programs, their various programs and their status -- they were there on the basis of government status and together to run a government that is patronised, that is sponsored by the MRND, so that there were groups of parties and the opposition within one government. </p>

            <p>I was called by the prosecutor of the republic of Kibuye to talk about Ndindabahizi. I was in the same jail with this person whose name was shown to me. He was also in contact with the prosecutor. I am sure that those statements never made it to the prosecutor of the republic's office. If that had taken place, it must have vexed them. I think that they would have talked -- confronted us about this story if that had happened, or such a statement would have appeared in our depositions before the prosecutor of the republic, because we lived together, that person and I, in 1994. We lived through difficult times. Even when he exiled to Zaire, he left his property with me. When he came back, he stayed for some time outside the country and then he was arrested. We lived together. I made these statements when we were together in the prison in Kibuye. So what I have just here -- heard, perhaps that happened, perhaps these are inventions. Nevertheless, I am not aware of such pressure of which you speak. What else? If there was pressure to designate me, it wouldn't have been necessary in 1994; couldn't have declared that. They wouldn't have gone to -- from Kibuye to see him. I think that's the only answer that I can give you to this question.</p>

            <p>My next question relates to the meetings of 29th and 30th April. You testified that one of them was a communal meeting and another one was a central meeting and they related to security in your area. Now, you testified that in those meetings the Accused was not spoken about because there was no need, there was nothing anybody could do -- correct me if I am misquoting you. So my question is this. This was -- the Accused was a minister in the government of the day, ********, he was a native and people were dying -- you say they started dying in April, continued through May -- didn't you see a need *********to at least approach him to bring him on top of issues in your area?</p>

            <p>Thank you, Your Honour. I did not contact him. First, we must consider the relationships between civil servants, especially given my position and his position, and given his position, it was difficult for me to be able to contact him for anything, unless I could individually contact him since he was a minister to help me, to try to help me calm the situation. But on a functional level, it was very difficult. Communications could not permit such a thing. You spoke about the meeting of the 29th; indeed it took place. It was with the members of the conseiller and members of the security council in the préfecture to see what we could do about the killings, see what measures we could take to try to reduce or completely stop these massacres. If he was in Kibuye at that time, if we had the opportunity to receive him in Gitesi, we would have invited him, as a minister, to our meeting for his support, but he was not at that meeting. The meeting took place. If he had been there, he would have participated as a minister native to that commune. We would have invited him and I don't think he would have refused the invitation, and we would have launched him through contributions. The next day there was a cooperation meeting in the secteur. If we had contacted him a bit before, if he had visited us before, indeed, I would have asked for his contribution to talk to the population of the area of which he was a native, but I didn't even think of that.</p>

As you have noticed, he generally spoke of the party and its position within the government that was there. He -- the president thanked the people in Kibuye. That is why when I explained myself, I said that the president in his address was not really discouraging what was going on. He really was trying to further what was going on. That is why in my commentary, when he said that, "You've worked well", he really meant that he was thanking the crimes that were going on.

Then you go on to explain how you came to that conclusion. Sir, if, in your opinion, the massacres in and around Mabanza commune had ended at the end of April 1994, why then would the commercial centre of Kibilizi remain closed until the French arrived in June?

            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Even if in Mabanza and around Rubengera where I lived the massacres stopped at the end of the month of April, I explained that one of the reasons was that the Tutsis who were being hunted down had gathered at the communal office where they had gone to seek refuge. This was around the 13th or 14th. Those Tutsis were sent to Kibuye so that they could be protected. To tell you the truth, there were no longer any Tutsi in that area, expect, rather, for those who were identified later on when the French arrived. They had been hiding at their friends' houses and they were -- they asked to go out when the French arrived, or sometimes the French found them when they were hiding. But there were no more massacres. You couldn't see any more Tutsis. Many houses were destroyed, the others were gathered at the communal office, and you could see them at Kibuye at the Gatwaro stadium. They left that stadium when some of them started to be killed. These were refugees from Busesero. Busesero was not in Mabanza but in Gitesi, in Gishyita. Interahamwe, who were going to kill them, you could see them come through in buses. They went through Mabanza coming from Gisenyi. They came through Mabanza to Bisesero. The massacres continued elsewhere, but in Mabanza, as far as I know, there were no more massacres.</p>

            <p>Perhaps I don't understand you, because in my statement I did not talk about a list of persons.</p>

            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, in the English version, in what I just mentioned to you now in English, I also did not talk about the list. So there is a translation problem between the two of us. Let us try again. Now, what you said yesterday, according to the transcript, is as follows: "The supervisor told us that somebody had encouraged him to make false testimony. The supervisor mentioned names," he must be the supervisor, "he mentioned names. He said that he had mentioned names of people to be killed and distributed weapons."</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>I said that the supervisor had been requested to testify against Ndindabahizi for having distributed arms for Tutsis to be killed, and that Ndindabahizi is said to have encouraged or sensitised people, too, and encouraged them to kill Tutsi.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>And did he inform you about the particulars of this? In other words, did the supervisor give you any further details about what he had said when he gave false testimony?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dr">
            <speaker>WITNESS DR:</speaker>
            <p>Well, those are things that the supervisor said in public. What pains me more was that the supervisor said that Ndindabahizi was wrongly accused, without showing <stage>(unintelligible)</stage> at that time that he did not see him, and also because during those difficult times, the person concerned was hiding at Karara's.</p>

            <p>Mr. President. Mr. President, the Tribunal has seen that we wanted to hear DQ before DP, who was here, because of technical reasons. Now I would like to appeal that the testimony of DQ be heard entirely in closed session. This is a very vulnerable witness. He worked in some official course in Rwanda and he exercised those functions that will be the subject of my examination-in-chief. The risks are many in that exercise so that I would like to plea that you grant this sitting in camera throughout the examination-in-chief.</p>

            <p>It was later on; on the 13th in the morning, at around 8 a.m., they came to fetch me from my house, from my in-laws. Then we went to Murambi, that is the headquarters of the interim government.</p>

            <p>Very well. Now, there were no offices because in principle we were supposed to work in the banks.

            <p>So, I do agree with that, but he had asked me, as minister responsible for my department, because I couldn't find the governor all the time. It was, rather, the minister of finance who was more directly concerned. I saw the governor, I told him what the situation was, but I reported that to the minister because the minister needed that information to establish contracts and to evaluate the level of funds. He also was to pay the civil servants; that is, the civil servants: the teachers, health personnel, legal personnel, and sometimes the gendarmes and soldiers.</p>

            <p>Well, I would go from the bank, the Bank of Kigali, to Murambi, and he would come from Murambi, either at Kigali -- at the Kigali bank or Bank of Commerce, because I used to work in those two places, either one or the other.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>As I said, he was in charge of signing contracts with suppliers. He also had to look at the state of accounts to see what the spending situation could be, and to spend, he could only see what had been deposited by the state into the coffers. We had 2 billion 700 million Rwandan francs at the time in the coffers. When the money became insufficient, he negotiated special advances with the national bank. He only did that once. Because the Rwandan government no longer had any income, any revenue, and so he had to go to the system. When the overdraft was completely gone, he had to look for other situations. And this was provided for in law. </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Given the event in your country in 1994, was the minister of finance's work real work or was it just a facade?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>No, he did do real work. Depositors were able to have their money because banks were open. Civil servants could get their salaries, at least those who could get to Gitarama could, so I would say his work was -- did consist in some real things.</p>

            <p>Certainly, I'm sure. Each time we would go to see him there, there were people looking for him, especially suppliers, food suppliers. Others were looking for advances; others were looking for past payments. That means he was constantly being looked for, as people were looking for solutions for payment.</p>

            <p>As I said earlier, it was once or twice a day: once to give him the information on the state of the accounts, and perhaps in the evening when we would go to have a drink in a bar that was very close to the government headquarters.</p>

            <p>Well, excluding the weekends -- we were working. On the weekends we didn't have any free time, but we did try to rest. Except we couldn't when we were really demanded. So it was mostly during the week, and I know that sometimes he went on mission to Nairobi and he left the work to his collaborators, the treasurer and the budget director.</p>

            <p>Did you ever know or learn that Mr. Ndindabahizi left his duties as minister of finance to distribute -- to go and distribute machetes in Kibuye, his native préfecture?</p>
          </sp>

            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>No, I never learned of such a situation. That would be surprising to me, especially because I know Ndindabahizi very well. When we were together in '73 in Butare there were Hutu and Tutsi tensions, and he never had any animosity whatsoever against the Tutsis. I don't know, but based on what I know about him, I don't think that he would be capable of doing such things. </p>

            <p>Well, given the position of a minister, it seems unthinkable that a minister would distribute machetes to the population. Perhaps a conseiller could do it, but a minister, would he really go out and do that? Personally -- this is my personal opinion -- I don't think so. </p>

            <p>Leave your personal opinion aside. Let's concentrate on the facts. Can you say whether practically, would Mr. Ndindabahizi have the means and time to organise a trip to Kibuye to distribute machetes, given what you know?</p>

            <p>Materially that would seem impossible to me, especially given the distance between Kibuye and Gitarama, and given his work and his workload in Gitarama. I don't know if he could be in the two places at the same time, but it seems very improbable to me that he could be.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Good afternoon, Witness, and good to see you again.Witness, I'm going to ask you some questions about your testimony in this courtroom, and if I ask you any questions that may seek to identify you or you feel uncomfortable with, please let me know, because some of them impact on the work that you did in 1994. Do you understand that, sir?</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Prior to the genocide of 1994, you were employed at the same institution that you have testified to this afternoon, were you not, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, yes. I've been working there since 1974, in actual fact. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>And you, in 1994, held the same position that you testified to in this courtroom earlier today? Just a yes or no; don't repeat the position, please.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, the same position as I occupied since June 1993, I believe. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>And the institution that you worked for was what we, in my language, we call the bankers' bank, was it not, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, in principle, because it's the one that oversees all the banks. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you. And would I be correct in saying that by virtue of that function of that -- that oversight function, the bankers' bank regulates the functions of what we call the commercial banks, does it not, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, sir, especially credit and exchange operations. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Isn't it also true that most of the reserves of the commercial banks are always held by the bankers' bank? That's why it is called the bankers' bank, isn't it, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>No, not true. Each bank was entitled to keeping its own funds. The bank only oversaw the level of foreign exchange as far as the entire country is concerned, but it didn't have direct control over the commercial banks. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Sir, that wasn't my question. My question to you was as follows: the bankers' bank, by regulatory authority, demands statutorily that commercial banks keep a certain amount of their funds with the bankers' bank; is that right? They can't keep all their money in their own vaults, can they?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>To my knowledge, no.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>No, the banks' funds belong to the banks, but the use of the foreign exchange, it is done under regulations from the bank.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>But are the commercial banks or the normal banks obliged to have part of their funds in the bankers' bank; that's the question. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>No, not to my knowledge, that is not the regulation at national level as far as I'm concerned, if I refer to what I used to do before I was appointed, because before that I was also at the directorate for foreign exchange.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>I didn't ask them for their ethnic groups. It is difficult to answer that question because I did not seek to know their ethnic groups. It is a piece of information that I do not have. I did not make any efforts to seek such information. Probably somebody else can answer that question. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-dp">

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Let me ask you the question -- let me ask you the question in another way. Did you have all 15 members of your immediate office after April 6th 1994? How many of the 15 worked when you got to Gitarama; let's put it that way.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I used to work alone. I used the commercial bank staff, especially for typing assignments and operations like crediting accounts.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>That's precisely what I thought the situation was, sir. Now, what had happened to the 15 or 14 or so staff that worked in your immediate office after April 6 1994, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>I have no clue, sir. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>So when Mr. Ndindabahizi prevailed on you and others on the 12th of April at your in-laws' house, you had no idea what had happened to the 14 or so people or 15 people that worked in your immediate office, sir? Is that your testimony, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>No, sir, I said that after the murder of the president there was a curfew and we all hid in our houses. I was only able to go out on the 12th when the situation subsided. We were able to leave Kigali.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-adeogun-phillips">
            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Very well, sir. Very well, sir. So it would suffice to say that when you then moved to Gitarama you ran pretty much a one-man operation, didn't you, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>No, sir. There were other members of the team, including the accountant general or the auditor-general, who was the head of the mission. He came next to the governor in this operation. We had the director for banking operations, and there was also -- there were also two agents that were found in Gitarama. They were responsible for producing cash-desk receipts. So that as far as we were concerned, that was the team. </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. I'm more interested in, sir, of the members of your immediate office, would I be correct in saying that you were running a one-man operation, not the entire institution, but your operation, your unit?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, in my unit, my unit, I was practically alone, apart from the fact that I used people that I found there. </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>And would I be correct in saying that there is a very obvious distinction, sir, between your role and the functions that you performed, the very practical function that you performed, and the role of people like the auditor-general and governors and things like that? There was an obvious distinction, practically, on a day-to-day basis, was there not, sir?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dp">

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Would I also be correct in saying that based on that practical distinction, you ran a very manual operation? It was not theoretical, it was manual, hands-on? Is that a good way of describing your functions at the time?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Manual, yes, but not routine, because it was not routine work. There was some discretion to the exercise, for example, which account was to be credited, et cetera, et cetera, so that it was not routine. There was some cross-checking of accounts or orders to be made beforehand, sir. </p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Pardon me, Witness, I didn't imply at all that the work was routine. What I actually meant was that it actually needed you physically to be present, it wasn't automated; that is what I was trying to say. Do you understand that, sir?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Other people? No, I -- there were bank officials that were there that helped me prepare the credit vouchers, and after that I handed it over to the payees, who got paid by the main cashier. So that I had my own work and the others had their own work. </p>

            <p>Do you know why it was necessary for the government to move from Kigali to Gitarama, sir, at this time?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Really I cannot answer that question because they could have done so in sovereignty -- in their sovereignty. They didn't talk to us to go there, and I don't know why they chose that location instead of another.</p>
          </sp>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Would you agree with me if I represented to you, sir, that the government moved from Kigali to Gitarama for security reasons, sir?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Certainly, because the city of Kigali was engulfed with fighting. If not for reasons of security, perhaps for other reasons, because they couldn't worked in a city that was almost falling.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>So, would you also agree with me, sir, that the location in Murambi afforded the government an element of security for at least six weeks, sir? Would that be a fair assumption to make, sir?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-dp">
            <speaker>WITNESS DP:</speaker>
            <p>Security, it is quite relative. Probably they were in greater security or not, but I'm sure if they chose that location it was because they were in greater security. Perhaps there are other reasons to that effect, so to tell you the truth, I cannot give you my opinion on this one.</p>

            <p>Well, apart from the fact that I used to give him figures of payments which were made out to suppliers and for salaries, I gave him the balance as well, and that was on a piece of paper and he used it as he wished, sir.</p>

            <p>Well, that's not the way to operate, but if I gave him information, whether it was in writing or not, it was between himself and me. He did what he wanted to do with the information because the governor had -- the governor had confidence in him and he was the boss too.

            <p>Well, they came to my in-law's very early in the morning and they came to fetch me in a vehicle. Of course I could walk down there, but it is rather far. From my house to Murambi -- from my in-law's to Murambi, already from my in-law's to the city is one kilometre, plus four kilometres on foot. I believe it was natural for them to come and fetch me by a vehicle.</p>

            <p>Yes. And on formal occasions sometimes after work he would find me at the aunt's house that I spoke about. We would talk for a few seconds and then he would leave. Or before going home I would see him in Murambi. He was coming -- he would come in front, pass by, but the conversations we had was at the aunt's house. Sometimes I would go to see that old woman that was his friend for a long time. She was a friend of his family. </p>

            <p>Yes, Mr. President. For the week of the 10th, 10th to the 17th, we, unfortunately, will not have any witnesses to present. In fact, we have very few left. We are waiting for Witness DD who can be in Arusha on the 17th of November, that would be a Monday, and who can start testifying on that same day. We are also waiting for the expert witness, who can be in Arusha on the 17th of November in the evening. We could like to work with the expert at least for the day, the following Tuesday, so that he would be able to testify on the 18th of November in the afternoon, and I think that one day will be sufficient for the examination-in-chief, and that would enable the Prosecution to cross-examine on the 19th of November, 19th or - - 20th.After that we will have the Accused, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. If we look at our calendar, I think that he can begin testifying on the 24th of November, if my math is correct. I think that examination-in-chief of Mr. Ndindabahizi should last approximately half a day, perhaps one whole day -- one whole day, perhaps, in examination-in-chief. In other words, I should have finished my case by the 26th of November at the very latest. </p>

But it is not only the Great Lakes that I am interested in, because I published a history of Morocco, a history of Egypt, a history of South Africa, several general works concerning areas that are more expansive in Africa, especially -- this is a voluminous book that came out four years ago on the history of Rwanda; and I am ready to publish in April a book on the history of the genocide; and this week in the United States, a book entitled The African Legacy, which thought <stage>(sic)</stage> on the history of Africa by a research worker who has been roving the continent over the last 30 years and has come to a stage where he could put something down on paper from his own point of view.</p>

            <p>Very well. I believe that that suffices, appears to me to be comprehensive. The Defence is happy about your competence as far as this area is concerned. We could, therefore, begin to talk about your report, your expert report. Expert -- you have served <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> report entitled, "Report by Bernard Lugan", expert witness before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; is that correct?</p>

            <p>Yes, Counsel.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, let us go through the report, the expert report. We will be more precise concerning questions of pertinence to this case and Tribunal, but so far as questions I should like to ask you, Expert, we all know that the contemporary history of Rwanda appears to be linked to the coexistence of various ethnic groups on the Rwandan territory. Very quickly, could you say more about that, about the ethnic groups, which are the ethnic groups, where do they come from, and when did they settle down in Rwandan territory.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, the question is very important because there is the <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> of reality, on the one hand, and then there is the imaginary. It so happens that the imaginary is, of course, very determining in the events that came afterwards. Now, I should like to dwell on a particular issue that is concerning the second point of your question. Rapidly, I would like to say that this is all known that there are three ethnic groups, the pigmy, the Batwa, the Hutu and the Tutsi. Now, when one says that one has said all, one has said nothing, because the Hutu and the Tutsi speak the same language. They have the same religion, the same value systems. They were aware of belonging to the same state. Now, semantically speaking, these are not different ethnic groups; they are members of the same ethnic group because the ethnicity is cultural. We are faced with another thing. We are faced with two populations which originally were different, and the most modern and contemporary research on this issue would allow us to make considerable progress. Now, the Hutu, for example, the <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> of the Hutu, that is the proto-Hutu, as they could be called, come from West Africa, following extensive migrations, that are known to linguistic archaeology, and Professor Vansina. Now, these ancestors of the Hutus arrived when? It is an open question. It could be said that they arrived between 8 BC and 500 BC. Now, we know that they didn't circumvent the forest by the north, but they crossed it from Manyema, and from Manyema, they went through Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika. Linguistic archaeology would determine that the languages in those areas are proto languages of all the Bantu languages around the lakes, which shows the migration. As far as the Tutsi are concerned, the situation is more complicated because of the official ideology of the Hutu monarchy, just as the official ideology of the Hutu monarchy was tantamount to saying that the Tutsi arrived recently. Now, why is that? Because when the last clans, the Nyginya, the Bega, gave rise to the contemporary and modern monarchy of Rwanda, when they arrived, they are talking about the last migration, because all of the Tutsi, just as all of the pastoral population in the Great Lakes areas and in East Africa, came from the north. The phenomenon is well known. It is related to the last phase of the drying up of the Sahara. And those populations left the Sahara towards the Nile valley -- present-day Sudan. It took them from 700 BC, and then they went down. So that, firstly, in Rwanda and in Burundi, in the Great Lake areas and in eastern Africa, there are pastoral populations of the Tutsi type or Tutsi typology. But those who were going to create modern Rwanda were the last to arrive. They arrived in the 14th-15th centuries. And in order to assert their <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> regions invented a divine origin, the Ibimanuka, "that which came from the sky", to determine their civilisation. So that we are faced with a considerable contradiction here. We know through archaeology, through history, that the proto-Tutsi, or the P-Tutsi, were there for more than 2,000 years, but the official Tutsi traditions, they ought to legitimise the presence of those people. So that we are faced with two historical situations created by the Tutsi monarchy. Now, the actual <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> is that the Hutu are going to use the official mystique, official Tutsi and dynastic mystique, to legitimise the 1959 revolution that we will talk about later on. So that if you ask me when did the Tutsi arrive, my answer is that for the majority of the Tutsi population, probably 2,000 years ago, but for the leading clans and for the Nyginya, the Bega and the other clans, probably in the 14th or 15th century, because the migrations -- a long migration. Here, we are at the crux of the entire contradiction -- of the contradictions in the Great Lakes area. Mr. President, if we miss that point, we cannot understand the rest of it, because the history of Rwanda is based on a series of falsifications, but those falsifications are culturally dominant. Hence, what is not said in the history of Rwanda is there. Have I satisfied you, Counsel?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. All that is very interesting, Expert. We have gone very far into the past. Now, let me bring you back to a more recent period. You have explained to us, and I thank you for that, that one couldn't understand the contemporary history of Rwanda without shedding light on the more early history of that country. You've talked about the ethnic groups. Now could you tell us, on the basis of the history of Rwanda, the history of Rwanda, has it revealed any cleavages, differences, social, economic, political differences between the two main ethnic groups; that is, the Tutsi and the Hutu?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, yes -- there are two -- yes and no. Yes and no, because it all depends on the area that you want to talk about. It should be said that each and every one wanted to get their system to prevail. The Tutsi didn't control all of Rwanda. <stage>(Interpretation unintelligible)</stage> demonstrated this in his work, in his thesis. Ferdinand Nahimana, who was one of my colleagues at the university, he worked on prehistory. <stage>(Interpretation unintelligible)</stage> demonstrated that Hutu power didn't govern the entire Rwanda. The Bushiro mountainous areas and the surrounding areas were controlled by the Tutsis during the colonial period only. Now, what happened is that in former Rwanda we were dealing with royal domains controlled by the monarchy. There were peripheral areas which, with history, would be dominated. Now, the administration of the land was very peculiar. The administration was three-fold. In former Rwanda, that is before 1900, you had agriculture and pastoralism. The mutwale wa butaka is the first on the line. These stages are very important because Belgian colonialism brought up an upheaval and Tutsi-ised that area. And then there is the second stage, and then the third stage, the herdsman. The lead herdsman is very important for the Tutsi. Now, it so happens that in the former Rwandan monarchy in general, three functions were held by the Tutsi chiefs -- in general, not all the time. And we've seen many cases in which the land governor was Hutu. So that the Hutu problem -- the Hutu-Tutsi problems were not there in the former monarchy, just as they are from the colonial period onwards. They were not created by the colonial period. But it is a matter of course that when the Belgian administration from 1924 and 1929 reorganised the administrative system in Rwanda, what did it do? What did the Belgians do? It extended throughout Rwanda what was prevalent in the areas of the Tutsi royal domain. And it was at that time that we saw Hutu areas that had never been administered by the Tutsi being put under Tutsi chief administration. And from that time onwards, the <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> hierarchy had no Hutu. Before independence, out of the 555 sub-chieftains, there are only about 14 left. Now, this shows the development of these administrative situations. That is why I am saying yes and no -- I'm answering yes and no to your question. Is that acceptable to you?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. As we said, this is very important. Perhaps you should speak a little bit slower so the English interpreter can follow you perfectly. Now, you were talking about the colonial period of Rwanda just now. Up to what date did that colonial period extend? At what date did Belgian colonialists exercise power over Rwanda?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Well, one thing, there were no Belgian colonialists. It was in '62 that Rwanda became independent, with self-government in 1961. Throughout the Belgian period, this was what it was before the Belgian administration from 1897 to 1816 was -- 1917, it was -- Germany was there. It was the United Nations that entrusted it to Belgium, and the United Nations confirmed that tutelage to Belgium. So that there was no, so to speak, colonisation by Belgium. Congo was a different matter, between '47 and '42 <stage>(sic).</stage> There was a report we had given to the United Nations on their mission. The mission was to get Rwanda -- to lead Rwanda towards independence. There were not masters there. Rwanda wasn't a colony. It was an indirectly administered area. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, to the point, then, how administratively and politically was Rwanda administered before the 1959 revolution, and what was the role of the various ethnic groups, that is, the Hutu and the Tutsi?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Well, there was a vice-governor that was in Rwanda. There were ten territories with territorial leaders. There was a certain number of chieftainships, and a certain number of sub-chieftainships. After 1924, we had 47 chieftaincies and five, six, seven sub-chieftaincies. It is through these chiefs and sub-chiefs that Belgium governed. But it was not Brussels; it was Kabgayi; it was a Catholic mission in Belgium: all of them participated in the administration of that area.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, this system, was it stable, or up to the time of the 1959 revolution did it change considerably?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>No, not considerably, but there were arrangements here and there in the following sense. Belgium tried, as soon as 1949 and '50, tried to associate the Hutu more to the administration and created the supreme council for the country. And in that supreme council, that was dominantly Tutsi, Belgium tried to inject more Hutu. But you can say that the administration was not the crux in the genesis of what happened and which led to 1959. I believe that the most important thing is to see -- let me come back to the religious aspect, which is very basic in determining. The colonisers of Rwanda was the Catholic Church. It was -- the Kabgayi archbishop was the real master. A policy in Rwanda developed between 1916 and 1962 and was developed in Kabgayi. And during the first republic it was done at Kabgayi. We'll talk about this later on, but what is essential here is to see the manner in which the Catholic Church developed. Because all the stakeholders in Rwanda, all things in Rwanda, are affected by the way the Catholic Church developed.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, let us go into the details. Thanks to you, we know that the church played a considerable role between -- 1959 revolution. In which manner did it play a role vis-à-vis the ethnic groups? Did it favour one to the detriment of the other or vice-versa?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>No, the Catholic Church came on the basis of a lie, a state lie. It came to chase the slave traders, which never were in Rwanda, because there were no slave traders in Rwanda. They were accused of being in Rwanda. Of course they wanted an argument. They had problems in Uganda with the Muslims. They had problems with the court in Belgium. They had problems with the Ugandan matters, which were very well known. They had problems everywhere. In East Africa, the Protestants were there. Rwanda was a virgin, so far as external religious influence was concerned. So they had to come in very quickly. They used the slave trade as an excuse to come into Rwanda. They came into Rwanda in 1889-1900. So they were received courteously at the court because they were sent by the Germans. The people in the court were very careful; they couldn't receive them otherwise. Now, they were given land to keep them aside in the south <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> where they set up their first mission. That was against the royal power. Now, so that there was the order of the white fathers with Cardinal Lavigerie <stage>(interpretation unintelligible),</stage> babouche dress and chéchie, in sort of eastern-looking attire that was meant to re-evangelise the people in East Africa. They came to Rwanda to change the religion of the chiefs. Now, the Tutsi did not want anything about that religion. They did not understand it. They didn't know the basis of Rwandan civilisation. So that was the first contradiction, because -- now, who was going to be converted first? Of course it was the Tutsi power that -- it was the Hutu who understood that the missionaries were powerful, they were supported by Germany, and they arrived. They came in with people that transformed the feudal relationship from the Tutsi chief to the Catholic mission by saying the missionary protector will be higher than the chief; at any rate, he will be less exploitative than the chief. So that the missionaries that came to convert the chiefs saw the rebellious subjects of the chiefs convert themselves. So that when the 1914 war erupted, there were no Tutsi who were baptised, but thousands of Hutu were baptised. Now, as far as the court is concerned, royal court, people were beginning to think chiefs were saying, "Well, is our competition correct? If we continue along these lines, most Hutu will be Catholics and we're going to lose. Our power will be gone". And the movement developed from 1916 onwards, when the Belgians gave more support to the missionaries as compared to the Germans, because the Germans had maintained parity between the Protestants and the Catholics. In 1916 there were no more Protestants because they went with the Germans. So there were only Catholics. The <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> Catholics, that's Belgians, supported the missionaries. So that the Tutsi chief -- well, it is time for us to change policy. Now, Monsignor Classe, Léon Classe, that is the Archbishop of Rwanda, felt that there was a chance. He established contacts with a certain number of young chiefs that were around King Musinga, and they signed an agreement, a gentleman's agreement, we may call it, an agreement. We are going to -- the Tutsi said, "We are going to be converted, but you will help us in our power". "Yes", say the missionaries, "but your king must go, Musinga" -- this is an article written by Monsignor Classe -- "and we will replace him by a Christian". And this is what happened. Belgium supported the missionaries' policies. In 1931, Musinga -- King Musinga, M-U-S-I-N-G-A, is taken away, is sent out to Congo on exile. And one of his sons, his older son, reigned under Mutara III. He was seen as the representative of the whites, the missionaries. Now, having done -- having abdicated forcibly, the missionaries broke the backbone of what was formerly Rwanda. From that time onwards, the Tutsi system changed totally. It changed totally because it was totally under the missionaries and the colonial powers, hence the events that came afterwards. And for the Catholic Church, the result was extraordinary. We're talking about the time -- in Rwanda we are talking about the Holy Spirit being like a tornado. We're talking about Christ. The king in 1946, Mutara, the king of Rwanda, consecrated Rwanda under the king. We are talking about the maximum stage of Tutsi alliance, alliance between the missionaries, Belgium, and the Tutsi. The Tutsi was no longer traditional; it became powerful. At any rate, before colonialism it had never had such power, and Tutsi power was generated very strongly. And from that time, there was a total disruption, Counsel. </p>

            <p>Counsel, this is an important question and it also helps me answer the President's question. Let me just open up an aside. The origin of Hutu power in 1971-1974, began in 1957. If we don't see how it was borne, Mr. President, we will go blindly ahead. It is excessively complex. We must have this background because phenomena will come one after the other. What happens in 1955? The alliance between the Tutsi monarchy and the Catholic Church and Belgium starts to break. It breaks in 1955 precisely because two essential parts of the alliance change. A new vice-governor is appointed to Rwanda. Harroy, H-A-R-R-O-Y. Monsignor Deprimoz, the bishop, is replaced by Perraudin, who is a Swiss bishop. These two men want democracy by majority, differently from their predecessor, who supported Tutsi power. They wanted the victory of democratic majority, and they would do everything to install a majority in Rwanda, and so the Tutsis would be all alone and have the impression that they were betrayed, betrayed by their religious supporters and by their political supporters. What would Mwami do? He's going to turn to the UN, to the UN, the protectorate. And the Mwami, the Tutsis -- and here we're at the heart of the issue -- will become nationalist and claim immediate independence. </p>

            <p>And the Hutus, on the other hand, will say, "No, we don't want independence right away. Oh, our great missionaries and Belgian fathers, please stay". They were afraid. They knew if elections were to take place for independence given to the Tutsi, their majority democracy would never come to pass. And they were before a paradox: Rwandan independence would not happen against -- would not take place against a colonial power, but an interior colonial power. The Hutus will use the external colonial powers to chase out those who represent the interior colonial power, that is to say, the Tutsis, and that is where the ideology of Hutu Power comes from.</p>

            <p>The Hutu-Tutsi question is never put to Rwandans before 1957. It is taboo. You don't talk about it. Everybody knows who the Tutsi and Hutu are, but the official version is that there are only Rwandans. They are different, but they are unified in Rwanda under the unificating monarchy. What happens in 1957, therefore? Some Hutus from the southern region, mostly from Gitarama and some from Savi in the south, published what was called the manifesto of the Bahutu in March, in March 1957.And here we see a rupture, Mr. President. Why is there a rupture? Because the manifesto of the Bahutu exposes all of the cleavages that existed that were taboo before. It globalises the Tutsi and the Hutu worlds. It considers that all the Tutsis are feudals and that the Hutus are serfs. What are they going to do? What are the interior colonisers going to do? They are more dangerous than the external ones. They are going to use the Belgians -- external -- to try to eliminate the internal colonisers. Who signs this manifesto? This is fundamental, because then we see the parties in the multi-party state. This is why it is important to explain this background, Mr. President, because we can only understand multi-partyism if we look at the essential parties that are born at this time.There are nine signatories, seven from Gitarama and two from Savi <stage>(phonetic).</stage> They have -- well, there is a common thing between them, they are all Hutu and they are all very devout Christians. Several of them have just come out of seminary. And the two leaders of the group, Grégoire Kayibanda, later to be the first president of the first republic, and Joseph Habyarimana, who has no relationship to President Habyarimana; Habyarimana. Gitera, Joseph Gitera, was about to become an ordained priest. So they were really from the Kabgayi bishopry.What would these men say? What would these leaders say? They are going to tell Belgium, "Let's not have immediate independence. No, not right away", and Belgium will be sensitive to this argument. Everywhere else colonists are being chased out, but in Rwanda, "Please stay, colonists". The Belgian colonists say that, "This is magnificent. They want us to stay. This is great. But the bad people, those are the Tutsis". What happens then? The Tutsis feel betrayed; they are going to provoke. What are they going to say: "You want to secede. You want to divide us". There was never a Hutu-Tutsi problem in Rwanda, and the Tutsis on the 4th of April 1958 are going to say that there is no longer Hutu or Tutsi, they want to completely suppress on identity cards the mention of ethnic group. So, in 1958, in April, they want to suppress this from identity cards. Mr. President, I would like to read you a very interesting page why the Hutus would refuse that by saying -- here we are at the genesis of these events.</p>

            <p>Yes, indeed, Mr. President. Thank you for clearing that up for me. I have one report here and the document on the other side; I can sometimes mix them up. Now, we can see this Hutu ideology being created, an ideology affirming themselves in front of the Tutsis. Once again, Mr. President, this idea did not exist before in the old Rwanda, in the pre-colonial Rwanda; this never existed. They became radicalised during the colonial period. Mwami protested this. He said, "We are all Rwandans, after all. This will divide us, and this must stop". But it was already started. The Hutus would go even farther in their radicalisation, until we find something we hear in the 1991-1993, discourse. These are not -- the people who spoke in '91 and '93, the radicals, were not the ones who invented what they said. It was invented back in 1958. This means that radicalisation began and political parties would start to exist, and they were going to use these things.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, indeed they were. It wasn't so fast, though, Counsel. You must realise that at that time there were many political parties being created. There were Tutsi parties, but Tutsi parties would be conservative, but they didn't really act. There were mostly two Hutu parties behind several political movements. First they began in the south in Butare, and a party was called APROSOMA, A-P-R-O-S-O-M-A. It is the Association for the Social Promotion of the Masses. Its leader is Joseph Gitera. And what do you see in their program? What do you read in their program: "Rwanda shall no longer be a colony of the Tutsis. They should not reduce the native Hutu to slavery". Another party, this is created in the northern part of the country, and this will be very different. It cannot get to the southern part of the region because it is blocked by APROSOMA. You see Gitarama in the middle of the country, where APROSOMA has influence. This other party needs activists and supporters and members. This party turns to the north for support, and here we are at the origin of the alliance during the first republic between some northern zones and the region of Gitarama. This party would recruit in Ruhengeri. It will go to recruit in Gisenyi. And what is the difference between the Parmehutu, this new party, and the APROSOMA? They have the same political idea in opposition to the Huti <stage>(sic),</stage> but the Parmehutu always mentions its association with the Catholic Church, and this is a party supported by the Catholic Church.So in 1959 everybody is in place, everybody for the revolution is in place. The UN is faced with a major issue. The UN, indeed, has given over to Belgium the mission to lead Rwanda to independence, but not at the price of a revolution, not at the price of abolishing the monarchy. The UN sees that there is a disequilibrium between the Rwandan monarchy, Tutsi, which is more and more isolated, and a new alliance between Hutu, the church and the Belgians. So the old alliance between the Tutsi, the church and Belgium is replaced by Hutu, Belgium and church alliance. Belgium completely changed its policies, therefore. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>The 1959 revolution was brought by two men, the church and Belgium. There was one military leader and the Governor, Harroy, H-A-R-R-O-Y, and the military chief was Colonel Logiest, L-O-G-I-E-S-T, the military leader. These two men have written their memoirs, and they are very exciting to read. They are pro-Hutu activists. When he arrives -- when they arrive at the head of the Belgian administration in Rwanda, they acted against New York and the UN and against Brussels to place the Hutus in power. The colonel, Logiest, was very clear; Governor Harroy as well. I can give you entire passages in their books and memoirs where they speak about their common combat for democracy against feudalism and against colonialism.I will not dwell on this, because I have the impression of what I'm telling you, all the historical background, might be a bit long for you. But I will have to stop myself, and that's a bit unfortunate, because we are going to miss some links between some of the things that I want to talk about.So this revolution is started by Belgium in 1959. Minor incidents become major ones. Belgium intervenes, and on the 11th of November 1959 the new state is proclaimed. The Belgian paracommandos intervene, and each time the Tutsis react forcefully against the Hutu, the paracommandos intervene against the Tutsis. Belgian soldiers stay, and so Mwami, the king, loses control. Tutsi power is destabilised. The subversion worked, and the monarchy is broken.In 1960 there are communal elections, and they are boycotted by the major Tutsi parties, the UNAR, the U-N-A-R, the National Union for Rwanda, and of course the Hutus win the election. It is a majority democracy. The Tutsis are 15 to 20 per cent, the Hutus are 80 per cent. One man, one vote; it gives the power to the Hutus. And so what the Tutsis were fearing, happened. Majority democracy is born. From that time, on the 18th of October 1960, the governor, Harroy, gives the power over to the Hutus, creating a provisional council of 48 ministers, and that provisional council will define the creation of a provisional government with a prime minister who is appointed, and that is Grégoire Kayibanda, therefore the man from the Parmehutu from Gitarama that we spoke about earlier. But, the game is not finished. The UN does not want to be overtaken by this revolution without having its say. It feels that it hasn't been considered as politically legitimate, and so the UN demands legislative elections -- they don't want legislative elections to occur, rather, as long as Tutsi refugees haven't come back to the country and as long as the pacification in the country has not gone under way.Brussels agrees with the UN. What will happen? The Belgian governor has a coup d'état. He disagrees, he disobeys. They bring about a coup d'état. They encourage the bourgmestres the government put into place and Hutu authorities to unite, meet on the 28th of January 1961 in Gitarama, and the republic is proclaimed at that time. The UN is put before a fait accompli. The UN can no longer lead a country to independence, a country which has just proclaimed its own independence. By claiming independence, there is no more monarchy, the feudal Tutsi power is overturned, and 28th of January 1962 we have the total independence of Rwanda. </p>

            <p>Yes. There was a series of massacres and killings. If you wish, we can begin to say that even the genocide of 1994 was not an invention from 1994. The genocide of 1994, over history, begins in November 1959. There will be variations, but there will be phases of massacres. The first phase, it is not very bloody; there are deaths, but relatively it is under control. The Belgian army is still there; it stops most of the massacres. We are in 1959, in November. Chieftains think it is better to leave; "Things have gone bad. Rwanda, which was ours, is no longer ours. We can no longer live here".Now, between 1960 and 1961 we see a phenomenon develop towards specific eliminations of persons. You will see little killings across Rwanda, one individual, one group of individuals, but it is not large scale yet. And then in the end the situation becomes crystallised in 1963 and 1964. At that time, there is mass murder, there is a kind of genocide, but it is a small genocide, small scale. Would you like me to talk about that, Counsel?</p>

            <p>What happens? This is at the end of 1963. Some Tutsi refugees are going to raid Rwanda. They call them Inyenzis, Inyenzi, which is also a cockroach. They are called cockroaches by the Hutus. Now, they raid the country. These weren't really raids, they just had a few people, peasants, with some traditional weapons, some of them had some firearms, but there was never a military plot described in the propaganda at the time. Nevertheless, the Hutu government becomes afraid. These Inyenzi are pushed out, in part, by the Belgian army, and after that in January 1964 they launch a concerted plan for massacres.What is interesting to see is that these massacres are not going to take place in the north. They will spread to the north, but they break out in Gikongoro, in that region, which is a region controlled by the Parmehutu, and I told you the Parmehutu terminate. You want to look at the origins of the Hutu Power. I have scientific evidence that backs this up. This is why I am continuing to speak of the genesis of the Parmehutu. We will see the same phrases over and over in the decades.In 1964 we have a concerted plan, but unfortunately for the victims there is no communications in Rwanda at the time. There's no NGOs, there's no observers, there's no journalists in the country. All communication networks depend on the Catholic Church. Who is in charge of the Catholic Church in Rwanda at the time? Perraudin, Monsignor Perraudin. He is the one who put the Hutus into power. So it is evident that one year after putting them into power Monsignor Perraudin is in a bad spot. How can he denounce the massacres that his protégés are committing? What about the alliances with the UN and the western countries? This first republic was a triumph of democracy against feudalism and arbitrary Tutsi power. He is in a bad spot to denounce the massacres that are going on. That means that this genocide is silent. It is a closed genocide. Nobody knows about it. There are no observers. How did the genocide of 1964 occur? Here, Mr. President, I believe that we have elements, documentary elements that we can find in the future. How would this happen? In Gikongoro, the minister of agriculture at the time comes to that region; a small meeting with the prefét. The prefét calls the bourgmestres. The bourgmestres call the activists of Parmehutu, the official party. The order is given to chase down the Tutsis, and only in that prefecture of Gikongoro there are between eight and twelve thousand Tutsis who are killed. We don't have the exact numbers, I can only give estimations, and I am a researcher and I don't want to give you approximations. They are vague, but certainly there are thousands. We can't be more precise than that, however. What will happen? Two hundred to three hundred thousand Tutsis will leave for exile, so the movement of refugees that began in 1959 and spread to '60, '61, will be amplified in 1964. The refugee camps from that time grow; the refugee camps, but also refugees move to Burundi. They move to Congo, Zaire, and other neighbouring countries. So here we are faced with the first reality of a genocide, which is very important. It won't be surprising to see that the Parmehutus' offspring will continue with the Hutu Power, just like their founding fathers before them. It will continue. This is why we must use historical perspective to explain events. </p>

            <p>Now, after '59 there was only one Hutu party, only the Parmehutu, because the opposition at the time was not another Hutu opposition as it is in the south, the opposition is between southern Hutus, Parmehutu Gitarama, and APROSOMA Gitarama. Now, since the Parmehutu party wanted to impose itself on APROSOMA, it was this time as the general spokesman of Hutuism. It will turn to the north, to Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, and there will be sort of a division of labour there. Political power was entrusted to the central Hutus in general, and the army was left to the north Hutus.Now, Counsel, this question is very important, because we are talking about 1963-1964. In that period the armies were not a source of power in Africa. The period of major military coups d'état came about in '66, '67 up to '70. At that time in the independent countries the elite that ran those countries were civilians, very often from faculties of law, faculties of arts in French universities. It is not like the period following that, when the military took power through coups d'état. So that it is not socially correct or beneficial to be an army man, so that they kept the political power and left the crumbs to the army. Especially in Rwanda; the army didn't mean much, it only provided security. And that they will regret, because the army had to take <stage>(interpretation unintelligible).</stage> So that an opposition it was in the centre south which transformed itself into the Gitarama Parmehutu and englobed the whole of the Hutu world subsequently.</p>

            <p>There was a Rwandan national movement; it is no longer there, it went into exile. Another movement, nostalgic, composed of old chiefs, had no control over the events or over the refugees, so that very gradually young refugees, sons and daughters of refugees, began coming into the political game in Uganda, for example, and in East Africa, and the anti-colonial movement was big, so the traditionalists were no longer there. Now, the other Tutsi party, that is, rather, the Rassemblement Démocratie de Rwanda, which was only marginal, it also disappeared in the years of independence. So that the Tutsis were on the decline from 1959 to 1960. The Tutsi that remained in Rwanda were to consider themselves lucky if they were alive. They had nothing else to do, they only had their business to do, but nothing to do with politics, and they shouldn't attract any attention. They were second-class citizens, so to speak.</p>

            <p>Thank you, expert. You have given us a clear picture of the Hutu movement and what happened to the Tutsi movement. Could you briefly tell us developments, political developments between 1960 and 1973? Was the power satisfactory to the Rwandan people? Was it the expression of the autonomy of the Rwanda people? Was it confronted with political, economic or military problems?</p>

            <p>Now, they used to say one thing in Rwanda -- I was in Rwanda, I came in in '72 -- they used to say the Parmehutu governs Rwanda, and Gitarama governs the Parmehutu. So that nationally, the Hutu nationalism was just never there. We went to the stage of regionalism. So that there was a slip between a Tutsi power, which was a power that governed the whole of Rwanda, with contradictory social reports that I've told you about, and a power that didn't see Rwanda as a whole but saw Rwanda in terms of regions. And the entire share of Rwanda from 1963-64 to 1973 -- 1994 changed a little, but there was a sliding scale for one micro-regionalism to the other and the history of the internal definitions within such regionalisms.So that the Kayibanda regime was a regime that was brought out, naked, by the Catholic Church, supported as it was by Belgium, a regime that rushed into a political catastrophe, and the political game was closed. That must make the people from Butare, that is the south, that is, the former APROSOMA people, were set aside, with a few exceptions. So far as the northerners were concerned, they had played the game of the union with Gitarama's end for several years. The northerners had lost their patience. When President Kayibanda wanted to turn in for a fourth residential term of office, things changed between the various regions and the regime had its back up against the wall because of political and economic problems. And many difficulties arose, and the more the difficulties were the more they turned to Gitarama, and instead of spreading they really concentrated on Gitarama to the tune of 80 per cent, and the government had its back against the wall.What did it do? The magic wand is used. The scapegoat was the Tutsi. They tried to use that to create Hutu unity around Gitarama, around the Parmehutu, and this began from January 1973. It was accelerated in February 1973, and then what happened? They developed a term that one cannot translate into English. In my first report that was translated, the scouring away, <stage>(interpretation unintelligible),</stage> to scour away, to hunt people out; it was not by force, they were told to leave, to go.Now what happened? The militants of Parmehutu, in all their administrations, came with their lists. They came with lists, and once again a certain number of responsibilities that we will see again in 1994 originated in Gitarama, not in the north, but in the first republic. The linkages are all there. And this purge went through the universities -- for example, the night of the 15th or 16th February -- in a violent manner. A personal example, in one night I lost half of my students. They were beaten up, and I couldn't lecture any more, because the students were not there. I had to wait for June. All the students were sent away, and it was surprising to see later on that some of those that were the killers came together in camps that were opposed, up to 1998. So that the situation was not healthy. The government was not sure of itself, and the government was scared of the army. The government was faced with a policy of contradiction, because on the one hand it was coaxing the northerners, the northerners -- that is, the militant heads, that is General Major Habyarimana Juvénal at the time, and some chiefs wanted to kill him. So that there was a contradiction, total contradiction.We were in a world that could be compared to a time bomb. The situation was very serious, and on the 5th of July 1973 Habyarimana cut the Gordian knot and General Habyarimana with his committee of public safety toppled the republic, toppled the Gitarama system, which was fruit that was ripe and ready to fall. And I can say -- tell you something I experienced: that coup d'état was welcomed with great relief.I think we should keep things in perspective and be objective, and we should not be carried away by ideology or propaganda. I can tell you here that that coup d'état was welcome. It was a relief, welcomed with a sigh of relief by the Hutu, by the expatriates, except for those that ran Gitarama at the time; except for them. </p>

            <p>No, I cannot say that it enhanced. He organised -- he created all of that, because you had militants coming in with their lists that earmarked Tutsi <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> and Tutsi students. Some were killed here and there during those events. Men and women were killed here and there. It was a movement that was organised for a very simple reason: the regime was at the end of its tether, and it used the Tutsi scapegoat. The regime would not have been toppled if it had been only that. It was toppled because everything was shaking. Everything was machinations, traffic of influence, favouritism, plots. One should have experienced it at the utmost in Rwanda at the time to get to know what really happened. It was like it was the day the earth -- I mean the world was going to end. And it was General Habyarimana that resolved the issue, that settled the question.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Not to my knowledge. The movements, those that scoured away, is different from the type of movement that happened in 1963, because those that ran away or got to run away were not followed to be killed. It was there, because -- it was there to show that the administration was nice enough to have Tutsi in the government. So that was a political move to show the Hutu that the government was a Hutu government all the same, and it was for Hutuism. There were mistakes, of course there were mistakes. For example, I saw -- the university was closed, and since there were no classes any more I had to go, I took my vehicle and went to Kigera where I used to work at the time, and I saw <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> on the road to that area, there were some huts that were burnt down. So there were events that took place that were very tragic. We don't have enough documentation on that, but I wouldn't like to dwell on something that I do not know about thoroughly. </p>

            <p>It happened just as anything that happened in Rwanda; we learnt about it over the radio. Well, I learnt about it in a different manner, because I was going to Kigali. I was called over the radio for an administrative matter, and I was stopped at the Kigali bridge roadblock. Throughout the morning I saw vehicles coming in the other -- from the other direction. They were being stopped and they were telling me, "You are going to Butare. Something is happening there", and when I got to Butare there was a military coup d'état. A committee for public salvation was established, and there was a coup d'état, and that coup d'état was very well received by the population. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Well, you are jumping the gun here, because there were two periods. There was the euphoria, and then the regime getting bogged down. There was the phase of optimism. General Habyarimana had a very clear discourse. He said all Rwandans have equal rights; the divisionists should go. General Habyarimana had a very pacifying discourse, and to the Parmehutu he said, "Our revolution was indeed sold by a clique, and I'm going to put the revolution back online in a disinterested manner". But that clique, the Kayibanda clique, they toppled it, of course. Later on General Habyarimana undertook to purge the people of the first republic, and they were all sent to the sinister prisons of Ruhengeri. But all the spokespeople, spokesmen and women, supported the coup d'état, and the Catholic Church, too. The Catholic Church was there at the face of Rwandan history. The Catholic Church immediately disseminated the following message: "General Habyarimana is a member of one of the oldest families in Rwanda. His wife was a fervent devout Catholic. It is a pious couple. This couple is going to run -- the general is going to run Rwanda like the head of a family, and he is a good head of a family".Let me correct something in my report. There is a typing mistake in page 5 of my report. I would like to correct this, because this report should not be official with this mistake. The wife of General Habyarimana is not Agathe Kanzinso, but Agathe Kanziga, K-A-N-Z-I-G-A, K-A-N-Z-I-G-A. Algaseke should be replaced by Karago. That is two lines after that. I'm sorry for this.</p>

            <p>Well, he used the power or party that he created in 1975, that is the MRND, that's the Revolutionary Movement, the National Revolutionary Movement for Development, MRND, which became the single party, and all Rwandans were de facto members of that party by birth. Now, here we are talking about 1975, the general phase of African history, and Rwanda is no exception to Africa. We are talking about the single party being in Africa for about 20 years. Except for a few English-speaking countries and Senegal, Africa will be ruled by single parties. That is what they used to call the authoritarian short - short cut that was supposed to enhance national cohesion in all countries, and Rwanda, just as any other African country, was also to use that authoritarian short cut. </p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, between '73 and 1990 was there a genesis of political opposition?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Now, such political opposition -- I would not say it was clandestine, well, it was not official -- it came about through plots, imagined or otherwise, the denunciation of plots here and there. For example, that involving Major Denise Lizinde who was imprisoned in Ruhengeri and freed by the RPF and who had a tragic end. There were other events such that the regime also turned to micro-regionalism. And what is important here is something that the historian has to contend with on the basis of hindsight, because we saw that the Hutu regimes that came one after the other in Rwanda, apart from certain periods, a limited period during their existence, always had to turn to regionalism, but also to micro-regionalism; in the case of Habyarimana, we are talking about northism. That is not true for Parmehutu, it talks about the south. Parmehutu was APROSOMA, and the other one was Gitarama. Habyarimana's regime cannot be Gisenyi and Ruhengeri at the same time, just as Rukiko or the Bakiga regime, those mountaineers essentially from Bushiri, the high valley of Mukungwa, those mountain people have never been dominated by the Tutsis, except for certain episodes that went to certain Tutsi chief. I am not talking Bugeyi and Rwenga; I am talking about the mountain areas. Now, those mountain people saw first the Tutsi chief during the Belgian colonial period. So it is clear that in proportion, events went on, and in proportion, as anarchy and the calling into question of power was there, the general had the tendencies to turn towards his own people; that's a human reaction. He was going to turn those from his own area, his region, his hill, and he was going to turn to his wife. And from that time onwards, we went from Hutu nationalism to northern micro-regionalism and Bushiri regionalism with that region which was going to run the affairs of state. In proportion, there were more difficulties, the more one run towards one's own identity; it happened in Gitarama.</p>

            <p>It should be said, Counsel, that Juvénal Habyarimana had a good military career. He had legitimacy conferred to him by the Catholic Church because his father was one of the first baptised, but his lineage was not very influential. But the wife of the general, Agathe, came from one of the very interesting families in the country, the Wakagari, in the Bakiga area, the mountainous area. I have talked about the work of Ferdinand Nahimana that talked about this dynasty in his first works. I am not talking about his political works; I am talking about his university work, especially his work at the University of Rwanda. And that lineage was one of the important lineages in the Busero area so that the general had to turn to the people of his wife, his wife's brothers, his wife's people, to influence people, Akazu.The Akazu was essentially composed by people who were from the family of the wife of the general, and the Akazu had a determining role. I talked to you about a certain number of responsibilities carried out by the members of the Akazu. Here we are talking about the apex of state. The important thing was to be recognised by the Akazu and to be accepted in certain circles by the Akazu. Akazu seconded certain authorities, so we are talking about a micro-regional system, a system of regional favouritism that came after the experience we had in the Gitarama region during the period of the third republic. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Now, for that, I think, we must transgress the boundaries of Rwanda, I am very sorry. The Berlin Wall fell. There are no blocks, and Africa is coming into a final phase in its history and the wind of democratisation was blowing almost everywhere. In July, we had the speech made at La Baule by President Mitterrand of France. All over Africa opposition was dying to emerge. There was a stifling of political life by single party states. There was movement in Zaire, in Togo, all over Africa; and if there was no movement the call for democracy all over the place became an aspiration, unavoidable as it was and insuperable as it was. It was in that context that at the time that when the regime was most uncomfortable because of the economic crisis, crisis by the payment of salaries, the food crisis. Countries were on the brink of shortages, and there was overpopulation everywhere, agonising as it was. In my book, I have talked about the suicidal over-population in Rwanda. It was thus that at the beginning of the <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> epoch, the population of Rwanda was six to 700,000. At about '62, it was about between one and 2,000,000, and in 1990, we were talking about 8,000,000 inhabitants. Now, all that for a territory as big as two French departments and only 45 to 47 per cent of the land is arable. Nothing is there to farm, there was no way out; there was land hunger. The refusal of the fertility pill was going to enhance birth; there was no birth control, realistically. Rwanda was exploding, was bloating out of itself over its borders, because pre-colonial Rwanda was bigger to the east as compared to what it is now. Because of the Berlin Conference, it has now been narrowed. So all these frictions, all these events were such that we are in the phase of a time bomb which is about to explode. No one caused it; there were many, many causes. There was one cause that we have talked about, that is the problem of what is now -- the Tutsi refugees that left in 1959 and came back in - up to 1973, had children, and their children grew up and wanted to come back to Rwanda. And whenever they said they wanted to come back, they were often refused for several reasons, but one reason was most determining. How would you in an over-populated country, how would you receive an additional, several hundred thousands of people? There was no place in Rwanda. And all these elements were such that tension grew and that is the job -- the context in which the Tutsi attack was going to occur, that is, the RPF attack -- we will talk about the RPF later on. That occurred on the 1st of October 1990. That is the context in which it occurred, sir.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>It's the Rwandan Patriotic Front. The armed branch is the APR or the RPA rather, the Rwandan Patriotic Army. It's a movement -- a multi-ethnic movement; it's called that. It's true there are Hutus within it. There's even Hutu combatants, in the beginning anyway. In the first fight, the directors would even be Hutu, but the RPF really is an emanation from the Tutsi refugees who lived in Uganda. It would be created slowly but it would become very important in Uganda starting in 1986 on which date in Uganda, as we know, following the tragic events in that country during the 20 previous years, those tragic evens would lead to civil war - civil war. And finally in that year, the current president of that country, Yuweri Museveni, would come to power now. Now, Museveni, who's from L'Ankole, belongs to the Hima ethnic group. Rwandan Tutsis who took refuge in Uganda took refuge in that L'Ankole area where the Hima live. Now, the links of ethnic belonging are clear between the Hima and the Tutsi, even if they are one and not the other, but there are links. There're inter-marriages through history between the two, and in fact, the most determined young immigrants, Tutsi immigrants living in Uganda following the persecution of the Obote regime, which came before Museveni's, would align with Museveni, and they would join his army. They get into his army, and when Museveni comes to power, those Rwandan Tutsis are very important officers at times in the brigades, in the training, and from that beginning -- time, the Tutsis immigrants are going to have a tool that is going to enable them to play a role in the event. Now, when the Habyarimana regime refuses to deal with the question of refugees, these men who are in the RPF are going to decide on the 1st of October 1990, to attempt -- well, we don't know really what they were attempting. Were they attempting a quick raid to take Kigali quickly, hoping the Hutu opposition were going to support them? Did they try to start a war? We don't really know. Nevertheless, they go into the country near Lake Muhazi, north-east of Kigali, and they are stopped, quickly. The RPA and the RPF move back and start a war that's going to last for three years, leading to dramatic events that we all know about.</p>

Zairian military aid would not be useful tactically, but we did see large numbers of troops that can occupy the area between Byumba and Gayayo. Now you push -- they move the RPF troops towards the north. Now the French troops come immediately, and it's felt immediately. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, Mitterrand's -President Mitterrand's son, called Habyarimana. The decision was taken directly in Elysée Palace, and they immediately decided to intervene. France sends troops who don't really intervene, but they are going to take over the airport and secure the areas behind the Rwandan armed forces, enabling them to support on that defensive line and launch a counter-offensive. That counter-offensive immediately hits the RPF troops, who move back and who go through much difficulty. Some of their leaders are going to be killed. Kagame is not there yet. He is in the United States. He comes back and he starts to negotiate with the Ugandan government to obtain authorisation to repatriate his troops, under the condition that they are not too visible, and they move back, they walk back very long into the Burunga massif, 3000 metres altitude.</p>

            <p>My next question, Mr. Expert: France. Did France unconditionally support Rwanda militarily, or was that support accompanied by some political conditions?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Well, by answering your question respectfully I will answer the President's question. If France can influence Habyarimana's regime through the multi-party state, it didn't -- it reacted immediately, it didn't count on that military support. Now, look at the feudal relationship between Mitterrand and Habyarimana. He is coming to the aid of his serf. He calls him, "Please, help. I am being attacked. My power, my friend, can you please help me? Send the Foreign Legion". "I will send the Foreign Legion, but you are going to do what I say politically." France does not hesitate to unconditionally support Rwanda. It would be an even better place to impose the multi-party state on Habyarimana.That is the end of my remark, Mr. President. I hope that you can be able to place that. I don't want to go beyond my bounds.Now, France is in Rwanda. The speech in La Baule was given in July. You see a contradiction. In July, Mitterrand says France will no longer help any country that is not democratic. And in October, it sends elite troops to help a country that is not democratic. So you have to play on both sides of the field. France is saying to Habyarimana, "We are going to help you, but you are going to start following a multi-party system." Habyarimana does not agree, though. He knows what are the main fractures, the deep fractures affecting his country. He knows he is very well placed to know that, and he knows that if a multi-party state sees the light, these cracks in the system will only get bigger. So Habyarimana will drag his feet, and finally we have to wait until June 1991 to see the multi-party state come about, or at least to see the day when Habyarimana would accept the idea of a multi-party state. How did that multi-party state completely become implemented? Well, it was implemented in many different ways. First, political parties were created. The main political parties that would become created would be those, the offshoots of former parties. The first party to be created in March 1991 is the MDR, the Republican Democratic Movement. The MDR movement wants to be, or talks of itself as the offshoot of the Parmehutu which brought Rwanda to independence and had scores to settle with the regime, I must say. Since 1973, the time when Kayibanda was thrown out and the time when the Habyarimana regime was installed, life was not easy for the Gitarama leaders of the old party. The second party that was created -- well, two more parties would be created, and they are very original parties. They are not at all affiliated with the old former parties. This is why, Mr. President, I wanted to insist but I wasn't able to fully go into detail about the politics of Rwanda in '58 and '59. We are at the heart of the problem and we may move ahead blindly. The MDR is the - inherits the Parmehutu and the political wing of it. The other parties, and not the PDC because it's a marginal party, but the next two parties are very interesting. These are parties in rupture, rupture with the Gitarama system and with the Kabaye system, and they don't agree with the MDR nor the MRND. This is the Parti Libéral, the PL, which is a small party, which is original because it is composed of both Hutu and Tutsis, and this is a party of intellectuals, businessmen, and it wants to be a party that is the party of elite. But it refused the opposition between Hutu and Tutsi.And then PSD, the Social Democratic Party, which is interesting, which is a party precisely whose political platform is that of refusal of the regional system, but also of the Hutu versus Tutsi ideas. It's a party that wants to move ahead and not look at the definitions that were created in the past. This party was created in the south of the country. It was created in Butare, and it's not by accident it's the big university town, because in Butare there is a tradition of ethnic cohabitation. It's a university city. Many research institutes are there. It's a city that is purely ethnic. Hutus from the north and the south and Tutsis all get together. At that time in Butare, there was physical eliminations like in other regions of Rwanda, and the Tutsis are not being threatened in Butare and around Butare. So, of course, that is an intellectual party. Filip Reyntjens, who wrote many interesting things about this issue, who I think was an expert before this Tribunal, talks about this. He said it's a party of intellectuals, of intellects, of idealists, they are idealists who consider that all those old things as opposition between Hutu and Tutsi is old news; "Let's be concrete. Let's not move forward with our head looking behind". And this party would develop, because at first the opposition parties would group against the Habyarimana regime, and here we are dealing with a fork in the road and contradictions. Why? I thought -- I think I have explained to the Chamber that extremist ideas that you will find in Hutu Power ideology are ideas that were born between 1957 and 1973. These ideas were created in the centre and not the north of the country. Those same ideas will be used by people who would not be afraid to ally themselves with the Tutsi PRF. Why? Because their objective is not Hutu nationalism but the eviction of the Kabaya northerners and their system against Habyarimana. Between cholera and the plague you have to choose one.Now, this will create fury among the northerners. They are furious that those around the president and the Rukiga in general, they say, "Where are we going with all of this? You, southern Hutus, or from centre, you have never fought against the Tutsi. You, who throughout history, you have become used to the presence of the Tutsis. You who have never revolved against the Tutsis. You had the Belgians and the churches had to put you in power. You are the same people who are questioning what we have acquired through the 1959 revolution, and you are going to try to evict Habyarimana by allying yourselves with the Tutsis to triumph in your own domestic programme". That is why the CDR in 1992 would be created, to get over those fractures. The Hutus have to be united. Any house divided inside of itself will lose. You are opening the doors to the monarchists, to the feudals, to the reactionaries, the return of the immigrants, because this all going to follow suit. We are faced with a paradox. The paradox is that the genesis of the Hutu ideology came from Gitarama, and these people, their inheritents are going to join up with the Tutsi, the opposition. It's going to try to use the RPF to weaken the Habyarimana regime. This is a more correct way of saying it.So this is a contradiction. It is clear, the rupture of those parties was written from the very beginning since they were created. It is a total contradiction.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>In that atmosphere of the multi-party system in 1991, did the government spontaneously have those parties work with them in the programme for the government?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>No. That is the entire problem. Habyarimana knew very well that the multi-party system would create anarchy and chaos. He knew the situation. So during the period between the date when the multi-party state was recognised and his death, he would try to do everything to stop the implementation of that multi-party system. And when he could not stop it, he would use it to break it, to slow it down. So the government that would be created, that would found, that would be implemented on the 13th of October 1991, the government that would be presided by a respectable man, a president of my university in Butare, a very reasonable man, Sylvestre Nsanzimana, who was a diplomat at the OAU and elsewhere, and Sylvestre Nsanzimana's government is an open government. Think, if all the ministries go to the MRND -- I forgot to say that the MRND became MRNDD. In addition to "development" they added the word "democracy", "for development and democracy". There is only one opposition minister. From what party? One of the smallest ones, the Christian Democratic Party, which only has one seat. So it's only a façade, this opening, this opening up of the system. The opposition parties are insurgent. What are they going to do?On the 17th of November, still 1991, the opposition parties, the MDR, the PSD, the PL -- the Liberal Party, they sign a common declaration of protest addressed to President Habyarimana, protesting the fact that the political openings are just a facade. They don't exist. From that point Rwanda enters into chaos. From that point the multi-party system will create chaos; I even would say civil war. Starting on the 24th of November 1991 up till March 1992, the tension would only get greater. The fights between activists and armed groups from the different parties would confront one another, and you would start seeing more and more Tutsi massacres, massacres of Tutsis in different areas of Rwanda, in the north, in the centre of the country and in the east. The situation becomes very serious and explosive, and in March 1992, President Habyarimana retreats. He retreats, and he realises that he can no longer stop this protest movement which is only getting bigger. People are getting angrier. And what does General Habyarimana do? He decides -- he decides to create a government of national unity, a government of national union. It's a political revolution, a revolution because the reign of the single party stops there, because the MRND is still in power, but with this new coalition government the MRND must now share power, and the MRND finds itself as one of the composing parties of the government. Even if the government is mostly MRND, there are nine members with nine seats. How is power shared? The government is created on 16th April 1992. The prime minister is a member of the MDR. His name is Dismas Nsengiyaremye, N-S-E-N-G-I-R-A-M-Y-E <stage>(sic).</stage> The MDR have four seats, four portfolios, the PSD has three, the Parti Libéral has three, the Christian Democratic Party has one, and the MRNDD -- must add another D - has nine.So MRND is no longer the master of the political game, or no longer the only master. </p>

            <p>Very well, Witness. I think we have made up for some of our tardiness in the discussion through that answer. Now, let's deal a little bit more specifically with the PSD Party. Witness, you said that the PSD had three seats in the government of 1992, but how representative was that party within the entire country of Rwanda? In which préfecture was it best represented? Were there ever elections that would enable one to see how representative that party was? Were there fractures between one region and another, the north and the south, the east and the west? What was the influence of that party in the country?</p>

            <p>Counsel, I am completely unable to answer that question. It's impossible to answer that question. There were never elections, those parties were created, but they didn't know how they were represented at all. Power was divided among those who had perhaps the most activists or those who made the most noise. How can we know the influence of the PSD in a system that had no elections? I can't tell you what the PL representation was, nor the PDC or anything. It is completely impossible to do; I can't go beyond that.

            <p>Do you have that exhibit before you? Yes, you do. That is a map that was submitted by expert witness Alison Des Forges. It represents the political representation in different regions of Rwanda in 1994, as a function of the party to which the bourgmestres belonged. I have a few questions about this map. Does it seem relevant to you and does it correspond to the reality in Rwanda? And the second question: the criteria used by Alison Des Forges, that is to say the political background of the bourgmestres, does that seem relevant to you?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>I would like to make one remark. I don't understand this map. Outside of Akagera Park, the white zone which is uninhabited, outside of Mutara, this is an error. At the time this no longer existed in 1994. This became inhabited. This should a commune. So this map does not correspond to the communes at the time. What seems bizarre to me, however, is that you have white zones that don't correspond to anything at all, and grey ones that don't have a corresponding legend. So I don't an explanation for the white, nor the grey.Now, I could give you some ideas just off the cuff about this. I am reading that yellow is MRND, green is MDR, orange is PSD and blue is PL, and the title of the legend in English: "Political parties of the bourgmestres in 1994". Now how, Counsel, could I possibly be able to infer from the political belonging, political party of the bourgmestre, how can you infer from that the political affiliation of the population? They are not - bourgmestres aren't elected. Some of them have been in posts for 20 years. This map doesn't mean anything. It is as if you were saying, "Look at the military zones in France, and ask each general what his political party is, and say, 'Well, that region votes for such and such a party'." Scientifically for me this map is worthless. It doesn't have any backup. But we do have a map that shows the political affiliation of the bourgmestres, but in no way does it represent the affiliation of the Rwandan population. So the bourgmestres are appointed by the government or by different institutions up 1994, affiliated themselves with the four major parties. They affiliated with four major parties after that period, and here we have the affiliation of the bourgmestres, but certainly not of the Rwandan population. </p>

            <p>The first time frame will be one for pacification. First of all, they should burst out of the war era, because the RPF retreated to the north of Byumba. It was a war situation. Negotiations should also be initiated. By 1st July -- everything before July, 1992, contacts were made with the RPF; a first ceasefire was signed and, after the signing of the ceasefire, gradually we started working towards the Arusha process. Now that government, subsequent to the Arusha Accords, had to undertake such reforms and leave its seat to another government.

            <p>Before the Arusha Accords, what were the effects on the Rwandan government after the two events that you mention in your expert's report, that is the RPF attack of February 1993 and the assassination of Mr. Ndadaye in Burundi?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Counsel, these are two very signficant events. These are two very significant events that should be underscored. Why? Here we are talking about frames of mind. I believe that, as I talk, I have underscored the psychological/mental elements. Now, this is the situation. The RPF is represented by it's spokesman, by it's allies, by those that want to use it to weaken Habyarimana. As a party, it's just like any other party, a party just as any other party that wants to play the game of democracy and, in turn, they propose to re-establish democracy in Rwanda. Which shows that all the extremist Hutu elements or groups would fall apart and all those groupings will try to insure that the RPF are the only ones to come in, to come into the game, and in February 1993 it so happens, and for reasons that I'm not going to <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> upon the RPF, it so happens, attacked. They attacked victoriously. It went beyond Byumba. It moved towards Kigali. Now, from that time onwards, what we call the Hutu extremists -- I call them Hutu nationalists, because extremists is of what? The Hutu nationalist are those who do not want Tutsi to return, would be winners. They would say we told you this is what the CDR is going to do. This is what the MRND people are going to do, because they are part and parcel of that movement. They will turn to the MRND. They will turn to the Hutu. We told you so. Look at what happened to your game. All the games are being brought out to light. We told you to participate in the elections. We told you to participate in the democratic game. No. They used arms and they attacked and the ceasefire is in force. Now, this initially gave eyes to major cracks among political parties and this phenomenon was amplified later on, on the 24th of October 1993, when President Ndadaye of Burundi was assassinated. He was a Hutu. Following elections -- there were elections <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> elections and he was elected; he was assassinated by a branch of the Tutsi army. Now, the second thing is that immediately the Rwandan Hutus that are <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> and the Burundian Hutus found that they were aggressed and so ethnic solidarity came into play, just as for the Tutsi at another time. The argument is going to be, we cannot trust the Tutsi. Look at them. They extend the democratic game. They lose and they kill the president. So how would you good Hutus, how would you patriotic Hutus continue to stand as to the position against President Habyarimana? How could you continue to fight against your camp by supporting the de facto lions with the RPF at the Arusha process, because the Arusha process will give rise to the sharing of power with the Tutsi. And the traumatism is there, profoundly, among the Hutu, because they are saying, especially the MDR people who hate Habyarimana, they hate him. It is true they had a very serious bone to pick with him in '73, but there they tell them, "Look, we are the same. Aren't we betraying our country, aren't we playing the part of the fifth column for the Tutsis?" So that from that time I believe one can use as a benchmark for the setting aside of regionalism to be replaced by a Hutu nationalism that transgressed the regionalist framework. In other words, the Hutu political parties, the nationalist factions of the Hutu political parties, came along with the extremist ranks in which said all Hutus must come together, they must unite against the feudals, against Tutsi invasion. It is the return of feudalism, slavery, serfdom. They will come back with their cattle, come to -- all the arguments in that direction were used. This is what happened. The first development would be accentuated by the disintegration of the main political parties, that is the MDR. Because the MDR, who is the inheritor of Parmehutu, wanted Parmehutu <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> for the return of the Hutu ideology of the '50's, the '60's. The MDR had people in it that supported the Arusha process. They supported the continuation of the opposition, so that Faustin Twagiramungu and Agathe Umwilingiyimana, who was appointed prime minister of the broad based transitional government, of course, with the disintegration of the party, which would subsequently come. </p>

But I prefer to use a word that is much more constructive, that is clearer. And to make a distinction between moderate Hutu and extremist Hutu, moderate or extremist Hutu, these are the vis-a-vis what? I would like to compare those that go along the Arusha process, that would mean power-sharing with the Tutsi and those, on the other hand, who do not want power-sharing with the Tutsi. Those Hutu that believed that Rwanda is Hutu which it transgressed leaves none of them to be Hutu and those who, for political reasons, want to topple the political regime, wanted to play the Arusha game. Hutu Power doesn't mean anything. I used as my benchmark the Arusha process, those who are for, those who are against.</p>

            <p>No. No. Every liberal party, which is a party that was set outside the ethnic system and it had two branches, the Hutu -- my friend Nysinga <stage>(phonetic)</stage> was killed, with his wife, in the genocide. That party was disintegrated, but it is remarkable to see that the PSD had to escape that. I will even go further and say that the PSD did not experience any glaring official currents of Hutu power. It appears they had another political agenda, a political agenda that transgressed those cleavages. One needs to look at the fate of the members of the PSD on the 7th and 8th of April to understand that. The PSD is a very strange party. Let me tell you a story that shows you that this party is very special.At the end of 1993 there was, at the apex of the tension, the confrontation between the extremists, political chaos, but what happened at the end of 1993? A delegation of young PSD militants went across the lines and went to Malindi in the military area held by the RPF. For what purpose? To play a football match with the young and active militants. And what is interesting there is to see that the leader of the delegation, called Félicien Ndungutse, was the first vice-president of the party, wasassassinated. And what is really interesting was that half of the delegation of the football players remained in the RPF zone. So if the party, which, according to me, and I'm sure, is a party which is not within the political game. The Liberal Party is a party but not the PSD, because PL has Hutu power. If you have the list, PSD, five members, four are assassinated during these events. The first was killed in 1994 on the 21st February; Félicien Katanbazi <stage>(phonetic)</stage> and the others were killed on the 7th. And out of the eight members I have 50 percent were assassinated on the 7th of April and on the 8th of April, so that here we are dealing - it's a pity -- It is a pity that the representativity <stage>(sic)</stage> of this entity was not established because the PSD was a party which could have held the key to reconciliation, had it played a better role. Had it played a better role, the tragedy we saw later on may have been avoided, but the only party that rose above cleavages and rifts was the PSD.</p>

            <p>Well, Counsel, I believe I have answered that question and, in fact, I've told you that in proportion -- and here we are dealing with when you want to do your best, you make several mistakes. The Arusha Accords was started to pacify Rwanda so we will ask questions, we that are here in the arena, to pacify through our work at each and every step, at each and every time a protocol is signed, there is a magnification of violence. Now, in Rwanda the Arusha Accords, in proportion, went on and precipitated violence in Rwanda because, on the one hand, President Habyarimana was going to do everything to <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> and those that were called the Hutu nationalists, or extremists will do everything to undermine. How? By securing the disintegration of their position, because in 1959 there was the revolution because there were two forces at play. The Tutsi, the church, and Belgium. Now, to the extent that the church and Belgium relied against the Tutsi, Tutsi power was condemned. The principle of the Arusha Accords was also based on those elements. The RPF; they were two elements, this is what they were called, literature throughout this area is concerned and the opposition <stage>(sic).</stage> Now, the dangerous stakes that were there in the Arusha process was that these three forces wanted to remain together, coherently. It is clear that on paper, on paper in a parliamentary-type organisation, European time, symmetrically aligned. We do agree that the political arraignment <stage>(sic)</stage> of the upper chamber, the lower chamber. But if one of those elements was to disappear that would be anarchy and all the entire availability of the Arusha process was based on the fact, on the postulate, that none would go away. The Arusha Accords said that the main component that was the Hutu opposition to Habyarimana was going to disintegrate, so that we have the Arusha process with a game of three and we are in a civil war with a game of two, because there was no civil war; there was only the RPF and the Hutu nationalists. So the civil war was pre-programmed, so to speak, in the Accords. Whereas what happened after Ndadaye's assassination and the MDR <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> was such that disintegration was unavoidable. There was no way out. Is that clear?</p>

            <p>No, the government was not established because people were dragging their feet. The Tutsi were not in the government; in other words the broad based government, is a repetition of the same government before with the same Rwandan political parties with less representation, and that less representation is compensated by seats to be given to RPF, to be given to the RPF Tutsi, and the Accord didn't give rise to anything <stage>(interpretation unintelligible).</stage> There was no government because generally, from April 1994, we experienced the tragic events that we all know of.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Now, let us move along those same lines and talk about the tragedy. What was the situation of the <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> of 1994 politically, in terms of military operations, if there were any, and in terms of ethnic tensions in Rwanda?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Rwandan political life was completely disturbed, all the components disintegrated and there was no <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> transitional government, because there was no legitimacy, apart from the PSD that was united, and so far as the PSD was concerned, there was no problem, PSD was not in the game. PSD was not in Hutu Power. All the other parties disintegrated so that the various factions of those parties said, well, we, MDR, have two or three seats that are kept for us in the future government, but who in the MDR is going to sit in that seat, the secessionists, the legitimists, the others. So that in the next following that year after the death of President Habyarimana all of the Rwandan political problems were going to be boiled down to <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> civil wars within the parties, all of them tried to persuade General Habyarimana <stage>(sic)</stage> that they were the legitimate ones and General Habyarimana was going to use that. He was going to use that card against the others, to support these against the others, and his own team was going to fan the fire. He was going to put pepper in the wound -- or salt in the wound so that there was total anarchy. As far as the president was there, he was there, he was sworn in and face to face with him he had parties that were divided and each was claiming legitimacy. So that the situation was a non-starter ,so that the broad based transition government was to be set up at the beginning of the month of September of 1993. It was never to be set up, never to be set up simply because the means were not there to be given by the United Nations for those concerned for the pacification of Rwanda and there was no agreement at all between the political parties.</p>

            <p>Expert, you have given us a picture of these <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> and political situations in Rwanda. Now we are at the beginning of 1994. We do understand that the situation is one of total chaos. We understand that there's ethnic tension. We understand that the Arusha Accords instead of giving grace to a political situation, has worsened, political solution has worsened the situation and helped President Habyarimana's plane shot down. Then this was followed by the massacre of the Tutsi. Now, the massacres ran for several months. Were they due to the political situation such as you described or were they due to other causes that you didn't talk about because you are not aware of them?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Now, Counsel, what is going to happen and what happened is a result of phenomena, long term, medium term, and the triggering cause, that is the death of President Habyarimana. Let us not talk about the medium-term or the long-term causes. If you want me to say who killed President Habyarimana, you will be quite disappointed because I do not know. If you want me to speculate about responsibility of one and all, you will also be disappointed because I do not speculate. I only talk about tangible facts that can be verified. This is my profession. So that I don't understand your question clearly. I believe I have explained various strings that brush about this fabric in Rwanda which has been heightened up to 1994. Population, for example. Food problems with refugees throughout the country. After that time there were refugees from outside -- from inside, but because they were displaced people from and throughout Rwanda. We had refugees coming from inside. The situation was chaotic. The French troops had left following the signing of the Arusha Accord. The United Nations was not able to deploy its forces. It was slow and all that compiled there was rancour. There was inter-Hutu civil war, which it came back so and because those I called the extremist Hutu, nationalist Hutu. For them the doors of the Hutu that continue to abide by the Arusha Accords, they're traitors. They are simply traitors that are allies in their eyes, they are collaborators of the invaders. This is in parenthesis. I am not talking for myself, I am trying to translate the frame of mind that obtained in the country. So that we are at a terrible conjunction of facts. There's a climate of pre-confrontation where Tutsi are being killed behind closed doors. It was not the Tutsi that were to be in the forefront, that will come out later on. It was the Hutu and those that were for the Arusha Accord, so that we have gone over regionalism as is tragic to see that in that poor country of Rwanda. The <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> country of Rwanda, that has suffered so much from regional separatism. His union or unity is going to be brought about by genocide. It was genocide that brought about some unity. That is the tragic paradox. We are in the realm of tragedy in this Rwandan situation. In Rwanda it is said that lies are equal to duplicity.</p>

On the 8th of April, in the morning, the country was ungovernable; ungovernable because the president of the country died and the prime minister was killed. All the authorities that were responsible for running the transition died. There was nobody. There was nobody in line that was there to insure any political transition. The only solution for those that were in power was to be contaginated <stage>(sic)</stage> or blended solution. I believe that you legal experts are in a better position than myself. I am a historian. And probably they would have come back to the former competition, which was the only one which was normally in force.

            <p>Counsel, the question you put to me is one that I cannot answer. Nobody is able to answer that. I think that is the role of the Tribunal. As far as current knowledge goes, we have no idea. According to what we know, we don't know. What we know, that that government was put together but we don't know who put it together. We have ideas, but they are not certainties.Let me move away from science and move into supposition or research. Yesterday I read General Dallaire's book, which I believe is not yet here. It came out in Belgium before yesterday; in Canada last week. And I was able to read it on the plane. It's very interesting, very, very interesting. It's very interesting, and many things that he confirms are in that book. What Reyntjens had said and what others had said before him, it's confirmed by a witness that was there, an actor. Soldiers tried to impose a military government. What Reyntjens said in his book, "Three Days That Changed History" even surprisingly Reyntjens is a good researcher. He has much talent. Have a committee that would oversee all of this, which is the overseeing committee of that. This is the committee -- a phantom committee which seemed to exist because a civilian minister would be there. With the committee we don't know what its composition is, at all.Counsel, I cannot go beyond that. Please don't let me leave my area of speciality, which is certainty, it's history.</p>

            <p>Yes. Yes. We can do that. We have great documentation. Here I can speak of certainty and I can say something about that. The interim government is developed on the 8th. It takes the oath the next day in Kigali on the 9th. This interim government, let's put it in context. Let me go back to history again. Let me talk about chronology. There are two things that we know. The first thing we know is the meeting at the Ministry of Defence on the 8th, was it very early in the morning. And I base that on what Alison Des Forges said. She is completely right. That meeting was early in the morning. The meeting took place between 8 and 9 in the morning. We have a second piece of information, which is a certainty, completely established by Reyntjens and others. The government is made up during that morning, composed during that morning. What is interesting to know is that that government will be composed in the absence of one of the political parties that should participate in the game. That political party is the PSD.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, I told you there's no longer anyone in the PSD, they all died. I gave you the names of the victims. Ministers left, they were either fleeing or they were killed. There was no longer anyone. So, when the meeting was called at the Ministry of Defence, there's no one representing the PSD. All the parties are there, even the parti libéral, the PL, because there's the Hutu Power branch of that party is there, but there's no members of the PSD -- well, rather, let's be more precise. Members of the PSD will show up, but much later. The meeting will be over. They will not have participated in the negotiation. The second thing we know, it's obvious and all the researchers have established this, and let's talk about Reyntjens again. He talks about this, the PSD shows up at 3 p.m. at the Ministry of Defence. The meeting began at 8:09 in the morning.When the PSD arrives, when the members arrive the meeting's over. The PSD is taken hostage. Members who are there, who are low-ranking members of that party are taken hostage. We will see why this government, this provisional government, needs PSD members, but later. But it's a tragic situation we are faced with.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Let me ask you the question right away. Why was it necessary to integrate PSD members into the government?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Those who -- I don't know what their name is -- but those who were behind putting that government together, could be perhaps soldiers, perhaps not. I don't know. Let's put a big question mark next to that. They represented a political ideology that was very clear. They represented the nationalist Hutu ideology, what was called Hutu Power or Hutu extremists. Why is it original, compared to the previous political past of Hutus and their affiliation, where we had people in Gitarama, the microregionalism? Then we had the microregionalism of Rukiga. People in the CDR wanted to move beyond that. They wanted to bring the Hutu world together. So in the context of the assassination or death of President Habyarimana, in the context of the power vacuum, in the context of the complete anarchy, it is fundamental for the PSD to be represented, because the PSD will be their trump card. It's a party that is not opposed to the Arusha Accords. It is accused often of playing with the Tutsis, of ailing <stage>(phonetic)</stage> with the Tutsis. The PSD is considered as a party that betrays the Hutu cause. It is important for those in the nationalist Hutu branch to say, "Look, the danger against the Hutu world is so important that even the PSD is here. All Hutus are united." That is why they take them hostage. That is why the PSD must be present, absolutely. We can speak of regional equilibrium of balance. That is a secondary issue. Regional balance or imbalance is already achieved without the PSD members. It has already been achieved.We spoke of political fiction. When the previous government shared seats in parliament. These are not determining arguments. I think that the determining argument and my conviction is that charges show that in spite of the terrible opposition that separates the Hutus, there's Hutu union, and these poor members of the PSD fall into the trap and they won't be able to get out. Why? Day after day things keep going and they find themselves, members of this government, dragged by what is considered as some kind of government solidarity.Mr. President, please pardon me for going back in history a bit because we have to understand what happened in history to understand what happened in '94. </p>

            <p>I'll be categorical. No. It did not participate. The PSD arrived between 3 and 3:30 p.m. The government was already composed. The list was already drawn up. They were put before a fait accompli and there was a survival strategy that had to be put into place. They didn't have a choice.Here we're in an air-conditioned room, people who are polite, we are having a discussion. We are having an academic discussion. Imagine the 8th of April in Kigali, the cauldron, the burning cauldron. Three times in my existence I've seen these kinds of situations where either choose between life or death. You must know -- you must live through this to know that there are strategies for survival in place that you have to use. And that will lead to one thing after another, a chain of events that is inferno. You will see when you see -- when you read General Dalliare's book. He sees two dead Belgian soldiers, his escorts refuse to stop. It's complete folly. It's hell on earth. And before this hell you have cold reactions, surgical reactions, people who are in situations that are completely exceptional.

Alison Des Forges makes a minor mistake in her chronology. She says "soon after delay" or "after some delay", "After some delay members of the PSD arrive."But they don't arrive after some delay.

            <p>Mr. Expert, you also spoke about the work done by Filip Reyntjens. Can you tell us in which work -- in which article that he wrote does he mention -- talk about the meeting of April 8th?</p>

            <p>Yes. He wrote two important books, one about the crises in the Great Lakes Region. But I'm talking about another interesting work he wrote written in 1995 called Rwanda, trois jours qui ont fait basculer l'histoire, "Three Days That Changed History" published by Amitar in 1995.</p>

            <p>Very well. In that book can you tell us, if you have that book before you, and if it's possible for you to do so, where does Reyntjens speak of the participation or non-participation of members of the PSD at the meeting of political parties?</p>

            <p>Yes, it's on page 88. Reyntjens is very clear. Should I cite this, yes? I'll read this, then.Let me read the entire sentence. "Next a government must be set up, a new government." Filip Reyntjens writes here, "And since they wanted to appear to respect legality the government had to include the same representatives as the previous government, so they had to include members of the PSD. It was decided, therefore, to invite two members from the politburo, François Ndungutse and Nyacinthe, Nsengivumva Rafiki, who arrive with an escort around 3 p.m. This is on page 88.</p>

Now we are 12 minutes late because I understand the Accused arrived too late; yesterday we were 10 minutes late because a staff member arrived too late; and last week I think we lost 30 minutes because of some handcuff episode. Now, I have still not received a report on what went wrong with the handcuffs, and I asked for a report on that. I haven't got it, so that must be submitted immediately.

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Expert, yesterday we were talking about a meeting that was supposed to have been held or that was held on the 8th of April 1994 at the ministry of defence in Kigali, and you had said that at that meeting the PSD did not attend. Do you confirm that?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>No, the PSD did not arrive at the beginning of the meeting, it did not participate in the negotiations concerning the setting up of the government. The PSD came after the government was set up. So my answer is yes and no; PSD was not there at the time the government was being set up, negotiated, the PSD only arrived at around 3 -- 3 p.m., 3:30 p.m., when the die was cast. That I can confirm, in the present shape of affairs of my scientific knowledge, sir. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Perhaps you can help us with one point, Expert. Now, we know that the PSD members that came at the ministry of defence on the 8th of April were appointed as ministers of that government, so how could they have been appointed ministers without having taken part in the meeting that was supposed to distribute the portfolios, the ministerial portfolios?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>If my memory serves me right, Counsel, I believe I answered that question. I told you that they were put before a fait accompli, and they were compelled to fight for their survival. The posts were distributed, the appointments were made, so that they were faced with a fait accompli. They had not a solution, lest they risk their lives. If you know what happened in Kigali on the 7th and the 8th, you would understand the fears that they experienced. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. All the same, I believe there is a small contradiction between what you are saying today and what Alison Des Forges told this Tribunal when she testified. If I refer to her report, her expert report, page 60 in the French version, where it says about the interim government, Alison Des Forges states: "After some delay the PSD members, Hyacinthe Nsengiyumva Rafiki, François Ndungutse and Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, came into the meeting -- joined the meeting". So that Madam Alison Des Forges is saying that those three personalities came to the meeting, and you have just said that they did not participate in that meeting. What are your grounds for that assertion?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>I believe, Counsel, that we have information that is quite clear. In the chronology of events of that very important day, since the government was going to be set up, in the chronology of events we have a benchmark on which we all agree. The meeting began early in the morning. There is an intermediary point on which we all agree: the PSD members were not there. And then there is a point on which Filip Reyntjens and myself do agree, that is about the arrival of the PSD delegation at around 3 p.m.Now, Mrs. Alison Des Forges is not very clear in her formulation. In English it says "After some delay", "Following some delay", "After a certain time lag". Now, the problem is very important. I did say so yesterday, Mr. President, I am preparing a book on the history of the genocide and its origin. The book will be published within the next coming weeks. I was saying that I was not directly interested in this particular question of timing as far as the day of the 8th was concerned, so that when I received the report of Alison Des Forges that you sent me I raised a question. I undertook some enquiry, because there was a contradiction. The historian's work is to underscore the contradictions. You cannot just write anything. "After some delay"; could it mean half an hour, one hour, two hours? "After some delay" could be 7 to 8 hours, because the PSD came at around 3 p.m.So that, please remember, I turned to you, Counsel, and told you that I had a problem, because that particular point was of crucial importance to me, and I had no serious data to enable me to go further into my enquiry. Now, you then sent me a document which is a document that came from the Tribunal. Mr. President, the Tribunal's documents court number or reference is TPI ICTR-2001-71-T, Ndindabahizi, 30th of November 1996, 8-11 July 1997 and 16 July 1997.</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Now, what does this document say? If I interpret it correctly, it talks about a certain number of testimonies, a certain number of testimonies from Mr. Ndindabahizi. Now, I should like to draw your attention, Mr. President, to one particular element. To date -- and let's be very clear on this one -- to date all that I have said to you was scientifically documented and verified. Now, with this document, of course, we are talking about a statement made by the witness, that is the Accused. Now, if I look into this statement carefully, it would appear to me to be coherent and I would say that it is reflective of the chronology, the timing of things done on the 8th. Now, is that sufficient? Is that sufficient enough to base -- to use it as grounds for assertion testis unus, testis nullus? So that I turned back to you and said that I had a problem because that testimony was coherent, it was logical, but that I could not take the liberty of committing myself on the basis of a simple testimony, and I asked you, "Do you have any testimonies that would enable me to cross-check, from outside, such and such a point in the statement made by Ndindabahizi so that I would revise my inquiry?" You said yes.Now let me draw your attention, Mr. President, to the document I mentioned. That is not in my report, of course. Why? Because it is a confidential document and Mr. Besnier confirmed this to me. He said to me, "I confirm this to you, on condition that you do not mention it. It is a confidential document". Even the name of the witness that I couldn't, but use Witness KA3. This is why I didn't mention it in my report, and I used that report on the basis of those conditions. Now, what did KA3 say? He says something very interesting.</p>

          </sp>
          <stage>Before the expert goes on, I think if you could kindly now direct us to the right documents so that we have them in front of us. Could you -- because you know the codes we are using inside this courtroom, even if the expert also may have them. So, please, first reference was made to P. 25. We have that in front of us. Which page do we look at? </stage>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I believe that the expert is using -- is relying on the first page of that document, more specifically, the first two paragraphs, that is the interview of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the 8th to the 11th of July and from the 1st to the 3rd of August 1997.The document mentioned by the expert, it is page 1, there is a paragraph, second paragraph that begins with, "The 8th of April 1994, I spent the night at Rafiki's".</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>All right. So, what is relevant here is the paragraph starting "Le huit d'Avril 1994" and then onwards. That is one document. What is the other document he is referring to then, please? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>The second document, Mr. President, is the testimony that was recorded by the Defence several months ago but which was not submitted to the Tribunal. So that in truth I didn't know whether the expert was going to mention this document today. This having been said, I do have a copy of it. I am rather uncomfortable, because we are talking about a protected witness who has not testified, but of course I can serve this document to the Tribunal and to the Prosecution.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Now, what is the pseudonym of this witness? Is that a protected witness in this case, but a witness that was not called in the present case? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, Mr. President. He was not given any protective measures because we didn't say that we were going to call him, so that he didn't enjoy the usual protective measures. So that I do have the name of the witness, and the written testimony mentions the name. This having been said, I shall serve it to the Tribunal. It will be an exhibit under seal, if we may, Mr. President.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Prosecution, are you aware of which document we are talking about now, the second document?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>No, Your Honour, we are not, and we would actually object to the production of a witness statement in lieu of calling the particular witness, unless the provisions of Rule 92 of the Rules of Procedure are complied with, otherwise we may not have a witness statement as an exhibit pursuant to the provisions of those Rules.</p>

            <p>So it is up to you, Defence Counsel, whether you want to lead this through the expert or whether it is unexpected that the expert is coming up with this. That's up to you. This is your expert. I leave that to you. But if at some point you wish to tender this as an exhibit, then you will first have to, of course, give a copy to the Prosecution so that we know what we are talking about, and the Bench would also have to familiarize itself with this document so that we know where we are. All right. So now we know, Mr. Witness, that you are talking about two different documents. Should we start maybe with P. 25, which is the simple one and which is the document which we have in front of us here, and that is then a summary based on a meeting with Mr. Ndindabahizi. Yes? What do you want to say about that, please? </p>

Is that the same document?</p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Very well. Interview with Ndindabahizi, Emmanuel. Very well, I am not going to come back to that because I have talked about it. It is a document on the basis of which I built the chronology of events of the 8th concerning Ndindabahizi, so that I am not going to come back to that. I am just trying to cross-check the documents at this time.</p>

            <p>But what are the relevant paragraphs here referring to the timing of the arrival of PSD at the 8 April '94 meeting? Can you help us with that, please? Where shall we -- do you find any support in this document for the fact that PSD arrived around 3 o'clock and were not part of the morning meeting? I don't know which significance this has, but just to be clear. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>It is not on this document that I am relying on to say that the PSD came at 3 o'clock, it is on the work of my colleagues, especially Filip Reyntjens, and on the literature. Now, this document that I am using -- let's be very clear. When I read Des Forges' report, this particular point concerning the chronology of the events of the day appeared to me to be very important. I didn't raise it beforehand because it didn't appear to me to be important. I noted a contradiction between certain specialists and researchers and what Madam Des Forges was saying. There appeared to be some imprecision, and it did not tally with what we knew about the timing of the arrival of the people of the PSD. I therefore talked to Mr. Besnier and asked whether he had any information, because I was quite sure -- I was not quite sure. Mr. Besnier communicated that document to me, so that I am not coming back to that document, Mr. President.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So now we know, I understand, that P. 25 doesn't really assist us here. Isn't that the case? </p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#mr-president">

            <p>All right. Then you have referred to Filip Reyntjens on a few occasions. I think that is a different reference, and that is also a document which you have produced, Defence Counsel, but which has not yet been entered as an exhibit. And this is this document. </p>

            <p>Let me point out the passage, Mr. President. Page 88: "Then the new government was to be set up" -- this is in French, for the interpreters, this is the first paragraph on page 88. Are you with me? It is the paragraph that begins with, "The new government was to be set up. It was confronted with the problem of the representation of PSD. It was therefore decided that two members of the political bureau be invited, François Ndungutse and Hyacinthe Rafiki, who arrived with an escort at around 3 p.m.", end of quotation.That is the passage I wanted to refer you to, Mr. President.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>It is the same meeting, Mr. President, that is dated the 8th, and that points to the arrival of the PSD members at around 3 o'clock.The preceding page, Mr. President, the preceding page, that is page 87, in note 154, that is the bottom of the page, we see the following: "In reality several politicians of the presidential group already met with Bagosora from around 9 o'clock in the morning", and it points out as being of 9:30, that is the arrival of General Dallaire.Mr. President, let me open a parenthesis. Unfortunately you do not have the book written by General Dallaire in Arusha. I saw a photocopy of it, and General Dallaire told me that he was at the ministry of defence and that Bagosora was there and certain members of the Hutu Power were also there.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>When the working session began at around 13 hours, the die was cast, because the politburo, if I can so say, met at around 9 o'clock with the personalities mentioned, and from that time onwards the entire chronology of events was mere formality. All the more so as for the PSD people who arrived at 3 p.m.; at least for them things were already over. Very well, may I proceed, Mr. President? Now, I was saying, Mr. President, something about the historian's responsibility. I happen to know Madam Des Forges through her work, and Mr. Reyntjens was my colleague in Butare, and who is a very serious personality. Now, on this particular point I did not work on in detail, and I saw some contradictions therein, and I turned to Mr. Besnier and asked him whether he had documents to allow me to forge ahead in my work. It was on that occasion that he gave me the documents that we mentioned earlier on, that is, the three interviews of Mr. Ndindabahizi that you referred to. Now, by going through them, they appear to me to be coherent, they appear to me to be logical, they appear to me to be acceptable, they appear to me to be reflective of what happened, the chronology of events, during that day. But as a historian, please understand me, I cannot rely on the statements of Mr. Ndindabahizi, even if they are coherent, to make an assertion. I turned back to Mr. Besnier and said, "Well, this is interesting, but I cannot use it". And Mr. Besnier told me -- I'm sorry, I asked him, "Do you have other data that would enable me on this and that point to confirm such and such an element in which Mr. Ndindabahizi spoke?" He said, "Yes, on condition that you don't mention it in your report". So that it is that confidential witness that is mentioned in the document given to me and is referred to as KA3. So that I do not know who he is, and I simply would quote what does the witness say. "In 1994 **********Emmanuel Ndindabahizi --</p>

            <p>No. Mr. President, there are two things here. The first thing are on the sources that the expert has for his report, some information, some data and some testimony. Now, the testimony that has just been read is part and parcel of those pieces of information, so that I didn't even know that that testimony was going to be used by the expert in his testimony.The second thing that should be taken into account is the probative value of the testimony. We are not saying that this testimony be tendered as evidence, we are saying that along with the documents the expert took cognisance of certain information, and this is only one of the pieces of information. That is all. It does not have probative value, it will not be tendered to the Tribunal, we shall not use it for Ndindabahizi's purposes. It will merely be a source of information, that's all. </p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. President, I think -- I don't know if this is really legal what I'm doing, but I will come back to the book of Mr. -- General Dallaire. It is a very exciting book. General Dallaire in his book that I talked about yesterday, that you should have next week, no doubt, said -- this book is coming out very soon. He talks about the prevailing environment. It is very surprising. And it shows the surreal atmosphere in which all of this took place. Page 357 of General Dallaire's book, he says the following -- it is the 9th of April in the morning. The 9th of April he goes to the ministry of defence, he learns that everybody is there at the Hotel Diplomat because they are getting sworn in. This confirms the date of the 9th. And I cite: "Once I arrived at the Hotel Diplomat I met a certain number of ministers and their family members. They were packing their suitcases. They were putting the goods into their cars. Nobody wanted to stop to talk to me".I am speaking too fast. I will begin again."Once we arrived at the hotel I met a certain number of ministers and their family members. They were packing their bags. They were putting their goods into their vehicles. Nobody wanted to stop to talk to me, each person was very busy to get out, trying to get out of the city. Later on I learned that they were moving towards Gitarama, some 60 kilometres south of the capital, to be in a safe place. This scene made me think more and more about the fall of Saigon, the installation of a government determined to take control over the country".Here we have an atmosphere that is very surprising, baffling. These are the last days of Pompeii. It is chaos. It is the final fall. Everybody is trying to save their own skin, and that must have been what this government was. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. Let's go further with these thoughts. Can we say that the government is made up of political ministers or technical ministers who have work to accomplish, or is it both? What is your feeling on this?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>You are asking me to make a value judgement. I'm a scientist, a researcher. I can't say anything different. I studied a bit of constitutional law, I know what the continuity of the state means. Let's leave the political ministers aside. In this government, there are technical ministers, I must say; I think so. Among those technical ministers, I see three or four. The one who interests us here is the minister of finance. He is the prototype of a technical minister. For the continuity of the state, the administration must continue to work, and generally when there is great difficulty and exodus in the country, which we saw in France in 1940 in June, there were two types of ministers, technical ministers and the rest. These are the ones who ensure the continuity of the state. The minister of social affairs is also, in this case, a technical minister. This is a large -- there was a large refugee problem, the need to feed people. That is a technical ministry as well, with work to accomplish.</p>

            <p>Yes, I do, and I thank you.Let's suppose that a witness came before this Tribunal and stated the following: that the simple fact that the civil servants were paid by that government, was for them encouragement to commit genocide. What would you say about that assertion?</p>

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>That's total speculation. That is speculation. The historian turns towards the lawyer. This just corresponds to my previous answer. We have to talk about the continuity of the state. The civil servants are paid up to the point that the state disappears. The state disappears when the coffers are empty. We are in a period where the state is retracting, but it is still there, even if it is an embryo, even if it is a political facade. I don't see a link between paying drivers or gendarmes or different civil servants, a link between that simple fact and an encouragement to commit genocide.</p>

            <p>Regarding those -- those tragic numbers, people have been excessively cautious. To be certain as to not distort reality, estimations, if we can speak of estimations, or macabre counting, if we could at the highest estimations, it's more than one million, perhaps 1.2 million. If you look at the lowest estimations, it's around 800,000. Unfortunately, in reality, it is probably one million.It is true, though, we will never know exactly know how many people died, and that is because people were displaced. We didn't find all the mass graves. Even if we had found them all, not everybody was buried inside of them. There must have been ten of thousands of cadavers that were brought away by the Kagara, that were lost in the papyrus groves.So I give you between one million, 1.2 million, I would say about one million. Don't ask me more, though. I don't know the exact statistics. However, I did work on a very important document. It's essential, in fact, and I have had it for some time. This document was published in February 1996 by the minister of higher education and scientific research, one of my colleagues at the University of Rwanda. Basing my assertions on that document, I can say that those figures are more or less exact.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is a very interesting document. It's a document that counts the mass graves and the victims and also counts the names of the killers and also gives -- and this a very important -- the dates when the genocide began in each of the different communes. This is a fundamental document for historians. I used this document very much to -- when I used -- when I made the maps that I put in book that will come out very soon. This was research conducted by my colleague at the University of Rwanda, and this is a primary source to any historian.</p>

            <p>I have had the document for several years. When I was preparing a report on Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the PSD party, naturally I went back to everything that concerned Kibuye préfecture. I went through the document and looked at everything that concerned the communes in Kibuye. I was doing my work as a historian, and, in fact, no, Ndindabahizi's name is not found anywhere in the document.I don't know if the Tribunal knows of this document. It is an essential document because it gives a commune by commune account of the researchers' work. They go through and give the names of the killers, those who ordered the killings, the date of the genocide, the number of victims, the number of mass graves. It is a document, in fact, that will be used to create memorials for the victims of the genocide, and in this document, Ndindabahizi's name is nowhere to be found, unless I am making a mistake or not remembering. Unless it is a serious mistake, I have not seen his name anywhere in that document.</p>

You said you that you were preparing a book on the genocide of Rwanda; I am sure that you have researched many different things and questioned resource individuals. Can you tell the Tribunal if Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's name has ever been mentioned or if you have ever read Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's name in the documents that you used to prepare your book, and, if it was mentioned, was it mentioned as somebody who incited or encouraged the genocide of 1994?</p>

            <p>Last question, Mr. Expert: Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi went to Kibuye on 3 May 1994. Was Jean Kambanda, the Prime Minister, at that meeting and were other political personalities present at that meeting? This was a public encounter, a public meeting. Some witnesses asserted that Mr. Ndindabahizi made a speech during that meeting. I will sum up what he was said to have said in that speech. According to witnesses, Ndindabahizi allegedly said; first, the PSD is not an accomplice of the PRF. Second, the PSD is not the accomplice of the RPF, and I prove it because the PSD is supporting Jean Kambanda's government. Does that possible statement of Ndindabahizi prove that he intended to support a policy of genocide, whatever that policy may be?</p>

            <p>I don't know that document, Counsel. I am going to talk about a summary that you gave me of the document. I am just responding off the cuff here. We have to look at the historical context. What was the context at the time in Kibuye? Kibuye, one of the worst massacre sites. He was at a meeting with the prime minister -- we are talking about Ndindabahizi -- amongst people who, of course, belong to the Hutu Power wing, the extremists, and they are against the PSD for all of the reasons that we spoke of yesterday. The PSD was considered by many politicians, many Hutu politicians, as a true accomplice, an objective accomplice of the RPF, therefore the Tutsis. There again -- and I must repeat myself over and over, I always say the same thing -- here again, we have to talk about a survival strategy. Mr. Ndindabahizi, well, I don't find it surprising, that, Mr. Ndindabahizi would say such things to get himself up, but what he said is not maximalist, it's the minimum he could have done to avoid a machete on the top of his head or a club over the head. He is still in his survival strategy. And so if you interpret the words as that, as those that he said, I don't see anything more than a willingness to try to gain some time, and, in rugby, just trying to make a pass.</p>

There are of course, a few footnotes scattered here and there, but these are basically explanatory notes. They are not, as such, references to the materials you used in reaching your decision.

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, indeed, that bibliography was given to you in large part during the hearing itself. It was a photocopy and references. Counsel, I thought that it wasn't a really university academic work that should be referenced as an article or a university paper. I was asked to give a presentation of the general framework and the chronology. Of course, I can give you a detailed bibliography, especially since I'm working currently on this issue and a bibliography is very important when you do such work. I think that from the beginning, maybe, it was a bad direction, but this bibliography, I can give it to you. And, in fact, yesterday I talked at great length about it and even earlier today during my testimony.</p>

We talked about Prunier, we talked about the report of Madam Des Forges and various books by Reyntjens. We have talked about all these works that you have which, for me, were considered as being in the public purview and that of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Also, I did point out certain works that are very precise but that are not in your own area of speciality that shed light on the issue.

            <p>Prosecutor, thank you for that question, because yesterday I didn't want to bother the President, and I did try to be succinct concerning this part. But it gives me the opportunity of doing so, and I will do so and I will probably go beyond that, and I will rely on the works that I am going to mention, that is, works on genetics, quite recent now, that will corroborate what we know linguistically, ethnographically and historically.Now, let us be clear. At the origin, at the origin, we are dealing with two different populations from two different areas of Africa. It did happen that in the course of the centuries, blending did take place. There was blending and alliances, so it is impossible today, unless one is farcical scientifically to say that there is a Hutu typology and a Tutsi typology. But what I am saying, what I am maintaining is that we are dealing with two different populations from the very onset, from the very origin. Have I covered that question, Prosecutor?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>I am being rather specific, Professor. I am saying, do you still maintain that racial theory as contained in your report, very briefly, that the sources, the origins of Hutu and Tutsi -- I mean, the distinction is racial rather than socially constructed; that when you are born, you are born a Hutu or you are born a Tutsi? This is not something that you construe socially, I mean in society. Is that your theory, because that is what you appear to be propagating in pages 1 and 2 of your expert report?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, Prosecutor. Your question is very clear. I do quite understand very clearly. Yes, absolutely. Here we are dealing with sole theories, sole theories. For many, many years, researchers are divided into various categories. Some categories concerning this issue of origins -- I hope I am not going to bore the Tribunal, but since you are giving me the opportunity I shall expatiate on this.For some researchers, usually researchers that are in the Marxist or post-Marxist era, we are faced with economic distinctions; for other researchers, we are dealing with ethnic distinctions. Now, the two are erroneous. Why? We are not dealing with ethnic groups in the semantic sense of the word. I said so yesterday. What is the definition of an ethnic group? It is cultural, it is linguistic. It's not racial. The linguistic and cultural element determines the ethnic group in Rwanda, both for the Hutus and the Tutsi. We are talking about people who talk the same language, they have the same culture, they belong to the same state, they are aware of the fact that they belong to the same political world. So that, by definition, these are not ethnic groups. In certain research, we are talking about castes. And all these elements are fundamental and they will explain the genocide.They are of fundamental importance. Why? Because either one belonging to one world or the other is final, just as sex, and it is from birth, or it is mobile, just as any economic speciality. The Tutsi are rich, the Hutu are the poor. A poor man can become a rich man and a rich man can become a poor man. No, that is not the case in Rwanda. In Rwanda one is unfortunately either Hutu or Tutsi, and 1 million people died, and this shows that that tragic reality is the historic reality, is the social reality. I will not transgress that, Mr. Prosecutor, because I can dwell upon on this for hours and hours on end, and this is my thesis of 1,700 pages. I shall not talk as a specialist here, but I can tell you that I am one of those historians that believe that, apart from particular cases of blending here of one climbing the social ladder, it has happened in the past. We know some of them. There was on the one hand a Hutu world and on the other hand a Tutsi world. There were ladders here and there. During the colonial period those ladders were cut off. The passages were religious, because those two worlds were not opposed to one another during the pre-colonial period. There were quarrels between dynasties, et cetera, but there was no place for the extermination one of the other as we saw in Rwanda in 1994. There were safety valves here and there which are such that through blood alliances, through religious cults, all these things disappeared with the missionaries. The missionaries forbade alliances. When in the battlefield, there were Tutsis here and Hutus there, the Hutus fought together, and if there was an alliance between Hutu and Tutsi, it was done, and that was often beyond the ethnic fact. And so there was solidarity here and there. There was marriage, for example. Marriage, inter-marriages were eliminated. Now cults, traditional cults, they were there not as Hutu or Tutsi, the cults transcended the realities. They were eliminated as being pagan by the Christians, Catholics or Protestants. So that those bridges disappeared.Very quickly, I talked about three categories that are chiefs: the chief of the land, the water, et cetera. Some chiefs were Hutu, and after the government scheme in 1921-1924, these bridges disappeared. So that there were two elements: one was one, a Tutsi, one was one, a Hutu, one didn't become a Hutu or a Tutsi because of the number of cattle. My thesis is entitled, "Between the hoe and the ownership of cattle", and this is my final position, Mr. President.</p>

            <p>Now, if it were put to you that whether you were a Hutu or a Tutsi, leaving aside whether you call it race or ethnicity or whatever, in the final analysis, depending on whether you have an "H" or a "T" on your identity card, if that was in practice the test, would agree with that, and if so, how would that coincide with the irreversibility doctrine on page 2?

            <p>If it were put to you that whether you were regarded as a Hutu and a Tutsi because of intermarriage, same religion, same culture, living together for centuries, very difficult to find often really big differences, even if you have the two-finger-in-the-nose test, et cetera, et cetera. Now, because people were so similar, maybe therefore that what it really boiled down to, whether you were conceived as -- or perceived as a Hutu or a Tutsi was whether you had an "H" for Hutu or "T" for Tutsi on your ID card.Now, would you agree that that was the position, and if you agree, how does that coincide with the doctrine that it was irreversible? In other words, once you were Hutu, you were a Hutu, because people might change their ID card.Now, what would be your comment to that, not to elaborate it, please, but just, I think that is what the Prosecutor is trying to put to you indirectly.</p>

            <p>My answer - I will be very short -- I do not agree at all with your position. Is that brief enough, Mr. President? I do not follow your reasoning, because you are trying to make me say what I am not saying. I stick to my guns scientifically. I can spend the whole afternoon explaining this, but this is what I am saying. I believe I am one of two or three specialists in the world about this, and we can discuss it all day.

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>I maintain the fact that to be Tutsi or to be Hutu is as final as sex. Even if you are in the Belgian period at the time when ID cards were made on the basis of the moment, some Hutus will say they are Tutsi, some Tutsi will say they are Hutu, depending on circumstances, depending on relationships here and there. But I am talking about definitions that are the original definitions, these are the basic definitions. I am not talking about exceptions; we can find exceptions. I am talking about the general basis, and I am formal on this, Prosecutor. You haven't heard that very often here, but I am confirming and I am upholding that position.</p>

I see what you are trying to drive at. Let us not talk about race. I am not talking about race. Let us talk about genetic differences and we will all be happy. I am happy to see that my modest view in Real Africa is known to people as honourable as the Judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

I'm an author that is very well read, and I am quite happy and proud about it. I was -- worked in collaboration for several réveils and over the last 10 years I have my own réveil called The True Africa, which is a very elitist review. It is limited in dissemination through subscription. And the reviewers get talking about things that one doesn't talk about. We talk about -- with people from some political schools of thought and this is about a certain vision of Africa which may be different from the vision I have. I'm not an ideologist. I believe I have shown that I had a little knowledge about Rwanda, and I had little knowledge about the issues here, and I wanted to create my own réveil in order to delve into the problems of Rwanda, because one cannot be interminably right about Rwanda. But in réveil, the issue does not belong to one. This is why I have my réveil. I can give you a copy. If -- you may not have a copy, although you mention it. I can make a copy available to you.

We are, at the university of Lyon 3, we are legal experts, economists, philosophers, people of art. We have about 12 to 15 faculties. We have 4,000 lecturers. I do not know what you are talking about, because indeed, when one talks about revisionism one talks about Lyon 2, not University of Lyon 3, the other university of Lyon. Mr. Prosecutor, this is where the Internet fails, once again, because documentation based on the Internet without any criticism gives rise to calumny and not to scientific debate. I thought we were here to talk about Rwanda and the PSD. Now you are telling me rumours that were taken to Court, and I won 14 of them. And now I refuse to be dragged into such a debate, and I will not say anything further. Let us be scientific here, if we may, and not talk about rumours, the type that is merely meant for recreation, if I may so say.</p>

Do you know about the works of Mr. Lugan, his scientific approach to the history of Rwanda? Do you not think it is sufficient in its approach?" Guichaoua says, "It is always very difficult to make very appropriate statements about the works of my colleagues; nonetheless, I feel that with regard to his works and, in particular, to those made by Bernard Logan, I do not agree with the theories he has presented."

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>So <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> very well. We can talk about it. He doesn't agree with my theories. What's his curriculum vitae as compared to mine? I'm ready to talk to anybody. I do not use these foul methods. Yesterday you saw that I do have -- I gave you the impression that I knew the history, of Rwanda. Probably I gave you an impression that is different. I am suddenly of an opinion different than his. We are talking about -- I'm from the French academe. I'll go back to academe. The problem is very clear. We are dealing with a problem of two schools of thoughts, Africanese, the French Africanist -- this is a very Franco French problem. He defends the theory that there's no Hutu -- no Hutu. He is saying Hutus and Tutsi were created by organisation. I'm saying no. The Hutu and the Tutsi were not created by organisation. They were there before. Not only were they there before but they are two elements, but they are different. On that basis, and nothing more, came tumbling down on me and you were here to weaken my position, my scientific position, to attack me on areas that I'm not scientific. I am sorry to say so, this is not cricket. We may very well talk about science, but to talk about persons that gave into them, these are not articles, they are interviews or interpretations of interviews. I've always accepted it is the work of the university man or research worker to use what he has been able to discover, what he has been able to observe, and a university teacher-research worker should be able to talk to a panel as different and, as possible, I've done this in all areas, in all forum. I can tell you about the news that you haven't heard. Internet doesn't give you everything. For calumny, Internet is excellent; but for scientific work, there is less of that. I can talk about <stage>(interpretation unintelligible).</stage> For example, if a journal is a newspaper, it is not politically committed. I worked with Figaro, it's an economic newspaper, a centralist newspaper in France. I work with economic reviews. Now you discard all of that. You discard all my interventions. You should remember that you are face to face with an expert who is a professor at the school of Lyon in France, <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> studies professor in all the main military academies. Now all the people you are talking about are nothing. They are in the establishment of politically correct, indeed, but I am in another secteur. You can talk about economic jealousy in France, perhaps it's different elsewhere, but all this is to say that I am disappointed. I am disappointed on coming here. I have about 450 students first year, 250 students second year. We have my I exams in one and a half months. Do you believe that my university allowed me to come here for eight days to come here to explain foul calumny that you are passing on me? I am here to give you my conviction, to teach you about my realities and what I know about Rwanda. When you talk about rumours, where is the justice, where is the fate of the Accused? This is ridiculous. I am not saying anything further on this issue. No use you asking me any further questions on this, Prosecutor.</p>

Ethnicism is a reality in Africa. This is very good. This is exactly what I said. I agree with this. Very well. For the rest it's not correct, for this professor. I don't know if in Anglo-Saxon countries you have Carnival or Shrove Tuesday. Do you know Shrove Tuesday in the Anglo-Saxon world? Well, I'm at the University of Lyon. That is where we celebrate Carnival and we have a tradition of celebrating Carnival. We have two kinds of professors, from the old school there's one type who are afraid of their student and for them they wouldn't disguise themselves or put on a costume for carnival. But I'm very easy going, and I put on a costume with the students every year. The students, 150 of them, come in the amphitheatre and put on costumes. And I do as well, and it's not something we take very serious. That is a festival of liberty. The king could be a commoner and the commoners could be king. And we do this one time a year with my students, and we put ourselves on the same level. We sing together, they put on costumes and I put on a costume and we sing together. I like to sing old songs from the French navy, the colonial, and we put on costumes. And speaking of costumes, because in this article it's talked about, this has come all the way to Arusha. I'm a celebrity now. I had put on a costume of an officer from the 6th Regiment of Britain in Bengal with a beautiful uniform that comes from my family. And there's the officer's stick that all the officers have. I just saw today Tanzanian officers who had their stick. I had a whip in my hands, they called me the "Whipped Professor" and I came in a costume of the 6th British Regiment in Bengal who went into India in the 1880s. Now we're on a very funny level, now, Mr. Prosecutor. I didn't think I would come before the ICTR to talk about all of how we celebrate carnival in France.

            <p>Very well. I will read it by specifying that I did not write it. "Following his racist arguments", that is false, "the French academic, author of Philanthropic Colonisation to Humanitarian Colonisation, claims that pre-colonial Africa ignored writing, use of wheels, of pulleys, and animal traction." This is completely false. I wrote a history of Egypt. I never said that pre-colonial Africa ignored writing, use of wheels and pulleys and animal traction. I said that one part of Africa did. I did not say pre-colonial Africa, as a whole. Regarding racists argumentation, that is a value judgment. Shall I continue, Counsel?</p>

            <p>In fact, all of these documents have resulted in a trial I won. This is the problem of the Internet, people are accused on the Internet, but whenever you win a trial that's never mentioned on the Internet.

            <p>Not at all. My response is so spontaneous. I'm what they call a right-wing anarchist. I have no label, whatsoever. I'm a free man and because I'm a free man I have the luck of being free because I'm a university professor. I'm free because of my family situation. I won't continue. I had parents born before me, which is completely unequalled, but gives me great comfort in my existence. This has helped me to refuse compromise. I'm from a Protestant family. Protestants don't laugh about these sorts of things. We are rigorous people. I have my moustache and my ways of living, but there are some limits we must not go beyond, Counsel.</p>

            <p>Counsel, without being pretentious, I don't know if Newton was on the same terms with all of his colleagues, if all his colleagues agreed with him. I don't know what the others think. What the others think, I'm a researcher who knows Africa very well. I've published many works. I don't know just a little small part of Africa, as some of the researchers that you've cited. I have the advantage of being a man who covers long distances and long times. All of my university works always start with a very precise topic and enlarge it. I'm a man who works on big major periods, linking periods. It's these links that explain the rest of history. My scientific career, my publications speak for themselves. My university title speaks for themselves. What I told you yesterday, let's agree, Counsel, I don't believe that you can consider me as a joker from yesterday, what I said yesterday and today. Perhaps through jealousy or any other reason for criticising my work, those people do what they want. This is not serious business, Counsel. </p>

            <p>Not at all. Not at all. I simply wanted to say that in the short term, the new constitution, he could -- there could no longer be a confusion between military and civilian power. General Habyarimana had already reached the age of retirement. General Habyarimana became a civilian. He was president. They went away from this policy, which was the authoritarian policy where generals maintain themselves in power. We were, in a new system moving towards democracy, opening towards democracy. Habyarimana, in this system, would start to lose his military label. At any rate he had already reached the age of retirement described by the military.</p>

            <p>In the PSD, Counsel, there was no Hutu Power wing. The party did not break up. There were fractures within the party. There were many resignations. There were many -- there was much frictions in camps and sub-camps, and that was in the other parties, not in the PSD. The PSD is not an army regiment with a monolithic vision. Every man has his own sensibilities. Of course here or there you will find the exception, but as the Hutu opposition broke out against Habyarimana in that exploding world, which would implode later on following the RPF Tutsi attack and the assassination of President Ndayaye, what happened in the PSD is something we could call remarkable stability, compared to what happened in the PL party, in the MDR party, and compared to what happened in all the other opposition parties. It's very clear. That's the exception of the PSD. It's too bad that that party wasn't more important, because it is a party of balance, a party that had a calling and had a programme and it had ideas that went beyond all of those old divisions of the past.</p>

            <p>Counsel, the translation in English is very good, but it seems to hack up my thinking. In French, yes, yes, the meaning is there, but the nuance is absent. What do I say? In French I say the following: "In Rwanda the -- </p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>The sentence I want the witness to focus on is the third paragraph. He says, "From this moment on the Tutsi population living in Rwanda became hostages of the extremists because they were publicly and officially designated as RPF accomplices." Now I asked him whether this was the first occasion - this was the occasion when Tutsi were now labelled accomplices of the RPF. </p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>It's from that date that we truly noted the amplification of the denunciative process against the Tutsi as a whole, but let us declare, the massacres began well before that. They began, as we said yesterday, advanced as soon as the advent of RPF entered the Kibiro region in October with massacres all over the country and that were to be accentuated in various stages of the chaos. But it is clear from the time when the explosion, the disintegration of the opposition came about, from the time that the disintegration of the opposition gave rise to the alignment of the former adversaries or part of the former adversaries of Habyarimana with the CDR, for example, that we started seeing the policy of pointing the finger at Tutsi beginning to be useful in the political tools of those people. </p>

            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <stage>(continuing)</stage>
            <p>It was the arguments they used. What were the arguments of those people they call Tutsi extremists? Their argument is that they are the Hutu. They said, "We Hutus are divided; it's a matter of course. We don't have the same political approaches; we do have our own old quarrels; we hate each other, perhaps, but we are Hutu. Now, how do we assert the fact that we were Hutus in the face of the Tutsi, in the face of the Tutsi, of the RPF, who are attacking us, in the face of all the Tutsis that live in Rwanda, that they are our accomplices that are going to rise against us when the RPF comes here?" And this is very important, and this is why I entitle this paragraph B, "From the United Hutu Front to Hutu Power", because here we are dealing with the crux of the problem. We had three forces in play: the RPF -- the RPF, the government and all that is around it, and then the Hutu opposition; three elements. Now, the political game that is going to divest Arusha of its entire meaning, is that we are going to be faced with two forces: the Hutu element disintegrated, and part of it went along with the CDR. So that here we are faced with a bipolar world. And in the bipolar world, the justification of this bipolarity is pointing at the enemy, and the enemy pointed at has always been pointed at. But here it is really put in the forefront. You see, "We, the Hutus, good patriots, who were lost because of the Arusha <stage>(interpretation unintelligible).</stage> We were lost in supporting RPF because we thought RPF was a normal party. Now things are clear. We go back to where we belong, better late than never, and we are going to do that, because in spite of everything, we are Hutus. We are Hutus in the face of the enemy". That is the teaching; that is the ideology. Mr. President, have I covered the question?</p>

            <p>No, no. There were no grades. There were no grades in the University of Rwanda. I was a lecturer in Lyon since 1985. In Rwanda we used North American criteria. In the Canadian system, for example, there was classification. I had a contract on the basis of French cooperation, which was one of assistant. I was 25 years old. I was working at the University of Rwanda as a lecturer in geography and history, but I was never a senior lecturer. This is, very specifically, French. There is a chair, and of course there are very few chairs in African universities. One of them you mentioned. I am a senior lecturer, so to speak, but in the other university, this is a different system. Have I covered that question?</p>

And I had the happiness of being associated with Abbé Kagame, who has nothing to do with General Kagame. He was a respected historian about Africa and Rwanda. He ran one of the volumes of the UNESCO history. He associated me with those lectures because we had intellectual community on certain elements concerning the history of Rwanda. So that I only taught history. A little bit of geography, but mainly the history of Africa. That was my contract. That is what my contract said, at any rate.</p>

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>I am not saying that at all. Especially, I'm not going to make any gratuitous speculation. What I can say I can demonstrate, and what I cannot demonstrate I cannot say. As I said, when I speak about certain reports that I mention, these are not reports that I can corroborate <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> 100 per cent. I have a scientific démarche; I do not speculate. What I want to say is that Ndindabahizi was taken hostage. He was taken hostage at the ministry of defence, and he could not refuse that seat, that administerial portfolio. Everywhere people had been killed. There were dead bodies everywhere. The massacres had begun, and we were in an atmosphere -- I'm sure you understood it yesterday -- an atmosphere of hell. People had to make options very quickly because of survival. And I am convinced there, and this is a conviction that I have no grounds for other than my own personal knowledge of Rwanda and the context historical <stage>(sic).</stage> What the historian needs to, one, not to make any mistake about chronology; two, no mistakes about context in history. Now, from a historian, it is not objectivity. It is to place himself in the context of the moment, because we are not people without bodies. We are not <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> mechanical parts. We are human beings; we have options to make in life and for survival. And I am saying that Ndindabahizi had an option to make which would commit his family and people around him. He could not have done otherwise.</p>

            <p>Professor, are you aware that in the morning of the 9th of April, before the swearing in, Mr. Ndindabahizi borrowed a car from a friend, drove around in town to go and see where his wife and kids were, and then drove to the swearing-in ceremony, and actually was the last to be sworn in? Now, if this was a person who was taken hostage, why didn't he simply drive away at this opportunity? Why didn't he simply drive away with his family towards Gitarama and flee, if he didn't decide to take part voluntarily in this government?</p>

We were in a time of war. Now, I believe you'll be talking to Ndindabahizi. It will be up to his counsel to ask that question. I don't know what you are talking about. I am talking about what I know.

            <p>Okay. Now, I would like to quote from both the exhibit and this book. This book, its page 170, and what I'm quoting is produced under the sub-heading, "Negotiations Feed the Rise of Extremism". Now, on this page the writer has this to say: "In the short term, the extremists' main preoccupation was how to stop the growing dynamics of peace, both in the country and at Arusha. The MRND" -- D in brackets -- "kept protesting against the lack of consultation in signing the negotiations, while the CDR, in a more aggressive style, was demonstrating in the streets and fighting it out with MDR and PSD militants". Now, coming to this exhibit, which is interviews with the Accused, on page 8, the last paragraph on that page, it is stated there as an answer that the PSD was in opposition. It was an opposition party. "At certain moments, there were problems within our party and other parties. Certain members were being accused of being too RPF, while others were being accused of rapprochement with the MRND, two parties recruited for the PSD and the MRND. Previously, we had a party which was very united with MRND, which wanted to accede to power through the ballot box. Our party was affected by the problem of division". Now, you have come here, to use your own words, "to explain what the PSD was", and you have said that there were no factions in this party. I would like to have your comment on what the Accused says about this and what this writer has to say about these extremist factions in the PSD. That is my fist question. </p>

            <p>Your Honour, Your Honour, the originality of the PSD in this context -- which is not the usual type of political context, that was before. Here, we are dealing with splintered groups and disintegration. The PSD is the only party that had no splinter groups. I'm not saying that there were no quarrels. There were no splinter groups, whereas all the other parties experienced splinter groups. Now, the MDR, for example, when the militants fought with machetes, when Agathe was taken away, when Faustin was thrown out of the party, in the liberal parties they were at each other's throats. Nothing like that happened in the PSD. They didn't, probably, agree 100 per cent, but they had the wisdom -- because their political origins were different -- they had the wisdom to maintain the unity of the party. Of course, we're not talking about a soviet-type party, with a directive from the politburo. What I am trying to say is that, whereas all the parties were breaking up, the PSD kept itself in unity. This is a moot point. We can discuss it. Was it far-reaching, in-depth unity or artificial unity? All I've seen is that there was no splintering PSD. Now, let us count. Tragically, PSD killed; they were to think, as some people have thought -- some people have said so. The number of people dead -- wanted to show that the PSD was not seen as a party along the lines of Hutu Power. There was no disintegration of the PSD. We can talk about it for one or two hours, more than that, to say that this man or that man thought this way or that way. The thing is, the party stayed united. Have I covered your question, Your Honour? </p>

          <sp who="#judge-bossa">
            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you. That will suffice. I have another question. You have studied the history of Rwanda, as you have told us, and you have been shown the map which was tendered by the expert Des Forges. I think this is the map. I don't remember the number of the exhibit. It showed political parties of bourgmestres in 1994, whatever interpretation is to be put on that. Following multi-partyism in 1992 and the enactment of the coalition government accommodating more parties, would you say that the bourgmestres, the appointment of bourgmestres, reflected the support of the party in a particular place to which they were appointed? </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>The question is very important, and I answered it yesterday -- not totally, because what you are saying goes beyond what we were saying yesterday. As a matter of fact, the bourgmestres were appointed. Some of them would be appointed by local assemblies, but they were very few and not very important. And those bourgmestres were indeed going to join the political party. Some of them would not change; that's why MRND would remain MRND. Everybody was MRND before the multiparty system came. Some will remain MRND; others would go to the PL, MDR or PSD. What one does not allow one to say is that the inhabitants of the commune were members of this or that party. There is the leader, the one in charge of the commune, but that chooses to join this or that party, but the population is not concerned. Now, this map would have been useful if it were an election for the election of the bourgmestres, and the bourgmestres will stand on the basis of political lists, PSD, MRND -- PSD. And if inhabitants voted for PSD here, PL there, one could say that the majority of the inhabitants of such-and-such a commune belonged to this party. And this is not the case as far as this matter is concerned. Have I covered your question, Your Honour?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#judge-bossa">
            <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, thank you. Finally, you did say that -- well, you've given us an analysis of why the Accused joined the government, the interim government. You have analysed his actions before joining. I don't know whether you did bother to analyse his actions after he joined. That is one leg of the question. The other one is that we had a witness here who was a PSD member, who was a protected witness, and he told us that the members of the PSD had three choices, only one wasn't a choice, really, because unfortunately some of them were killed, but they had a choice to run or to join. And he was one of those who ran away, actually. What is your comment on that one? Those are my last two questions. Thank you. </p>

          <sp who="#witness-lugan">
            <speaker>WITNESS LUGAN:</speaker>
            <p>In a situation of conflict -- I don't know whether you have experienced one -- there are options, of course. And very often there is the choice of survival, which is the least of the problems that will take you away from danger. But usually, when you take that option you are opting for more danger, for a more dangerous option. It's just like the hunters who go to catch birds. They use strings, and if the bird puts a foot in that trap and the trap will hold it; but the bird would not put its foot in the trap, although it came to the point. And that was the same case as Ndindabahizi. Ndindabahizi was there at the pond; he had to make an option. I don't know Ndindabahizi. I met him here. I didn't even know how he looked. He was in the same situation. I don't think he was my student in Butare. I don't know, probably he knows. I don't know anything about that, so I cannot give you any answer other than the one I have just given you. It is the instinct of survival. If you morally have a knife on your throat, your first reflex is to push it away. If you push it away, and you fall in a hole, what you are looking at is not the hole; you are looking at the dagger of a knife on your throat. This is not a matter of option. You don't look back to see whether there is a hole; you have the knife on your throat. Is that acceptable, madam?</p>

            <p>But I wanted to know whether you also analysed the reasons why -- his actions after he stayed on. You analysed the decision to stay, but did you analyse his actions after he decided to stay on, so that you can also give us an opinion on that? </p>

            <p>Your Honour, I'll be very clear. I have no scientific evidence which would enable me to give you a rigorous answer. I have some guidelines on the period that would follow the formation of the government, but other than that, I am in a complete fog. That question is probably better put to Mr. Ndindabahizi, because putting it to me, I am incapable of answering that question, Your Honour. </p>

So that the witness that stood here did corroborate that he killed them. I heard him say so. So my sister did mention that to me too.</p>

Now, when I was asked how many children they were, I said ten and I was then told that one wanted to know whether among the ten some of them married any Tutsis, and that is the time I talked about Uwera. Uwera had two children who were murdered. Uwera had two children. So it was her grandchildren. </p>

I would spend two weeks if I had two weeks' leave, because those were small vacation and we had the big vacations in July through to September. I would spend those months at home in Gasharu.

            <p>I was not an auditor. I was head of the finance section, but I was not an auditor. There was another division; there was the sales division and made the audits in the branch offices. So the organisation chart is very clear. There is a parallel directive to my division and that was the sales or divisional services. That division did audit in the stores. They had auditors and they moved about from branch to branch to conduct their audit. My finance division did not have those responsibilities. We were not charged with auditing the stores. Therefore, I didn't have that authority to go into the stores nor did my employees. We were not auditors. Anything that came from the stores went to the auditors of the auditing papers and there was a sales division that took care of that. My employees and I did not have the right to audit the stores.

So in 1981, Trafipro wanted to keep me on board. I had no problem with that, but the civil service, decreed a transfer and transferred me elsewhere.

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, sir. The Director of Cabinet is responsible for coordinating the activities of the ministry. He is the one that coordinates the activities of the advisors, because in the ministry we had advisors and the Directeur de Cabinet also dealt with the coordination of activities of those advisors. Now, there's also the director general of the ministry that supervises some five directorates and the Directeur de Cabinet and the director-general together supervised all these services. The Director of Cabinet replaces the minister when the latter is absent. The Director of Cabinet carries out any other assignments given to him by the minister. So that that is, in a nutshell, the attribution of the Director of Cabinet. I hope I have given you all the details, but this is the general picture. With the Director of Cabinet, he coordinates all the activities of the ministry and when the minister is absent he is in charge of the management of the day-to-day operations of the ministry.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>The director-general was under me, and the director was under the director-general. This is the organisational chart of the ministry; Director of the Cabinet, who replaces the minister, who acts for the minister, so that he, was naturally above the director-general in the ministry. This is the French system, the Director of Cabinet, then the director-general, then the director-generals.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. It is just a political appointment. When the minister leaves, he leaves with all the members of his office, his cabinet. You have the Director of Cabinet and two advisors and the minister. They all represented the party. And if the ministry was to be run by another party all those people have to leave. The rest of the staff wouldn't leave, except those that came with the minister.</p>

You just mentioned it, but please take it once more, because, you know, the system of each country differs here, and it's important that we get your system right. So it's the minister; then you mentioned the minister de cabinet <stage>(sic);</stage> and then you mentioned two advisors.</p>

            <p>Then two advisors, one for political and administrative affairs and another for technical affairs. So that we were four. And it was the same pattern in all ministries, in all other ministries, even those ministries run by other parties. The system was the same, as far as political appointees were concerned.</p>

I opted to join one party, and I chose the PSD. I joined the PSD because I was not interested in the other parties. The party in which I was interested was PSD. I read its constitution, its mission statement, its ideology, and I thought that that was the party that suited me. I knew the other parties, MRND, MDR, etc. I chose the PSD after having perused their basic documents, their objectives and, of course, an account of what I knew about the other parties that were there or that had been there since the 60's up to '67. I did make a choice. The MRND was not of interest to me. The MDR neither. But after having given thought and, indeed, talked with people, including the chairman of the party, I made an option.</p>

            <p>I mean that following the creation of those parties, all the parties tried their worst to enrol members. They went to the various préfectures, the various regions or areas to get members. The various parties, for the MRND, the MDR, they all went around looking for members. This was how I joined. When I talked about recruitment or enrolment, it was because there was a campaign on the part of the parties in Rwanda. As far as these parties were created, they tried to synthesise people. Various parties tried to show people what they wanted to do, what the ideologies were and what orientations they wanted to adopt, and people accepted. They were not forced to join any party, but there was this campaign to synthesise people, to win them over as members.</p>

            <p>The PSD was founded by several persons, sir. You have the mention in its manifesto, some people came together, met, and they had the constituent congress to create that party. Some of them were very well known: Zamarambo, for example; Ngango. Zamarambo was president, and the other was the first vice-president: Gafaranga was the second vice-president or second vice-chairman; Gatabazi, Minister Gatabazi, was inspector-general of the party. And they became members of the national committee of the party. But founding members of that party were not only those four; there were others that sat at the congress. I cannot remember all the names, because I was not even there at the time the party was created. But in the statutes of the party, I can read the names of the founding members of the party.</p>

That -- those were the spokespersons of the party. But there was also a political bureau or politburo composed of those people, and we had a structure organisation covering the préfecture to the communes and even the secteurs and the cellules. Of course, at the top you had what we called the national congress. This was the organisational format, if you will, of the PSD party.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. The PSD enrolled members from all ethnic groups in Rwanda, Hutus and Tutsi. You could find Hutu and Tutsi within the PSD, and we know that even in the objective of the party, it was stipulated that ethnic groups were not to be mentioned in identity documents. So that the PSD did not have any problems of discriminating between various ethnic groups. There was no distinction of ethnic groups within the PSD. This was the reason why they proposed that ethnicity should not be mentioned in identity documents. I hope I have covered the question properly. Be that as it may, I can say there was no Hutu-Tusti problem in our party.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>The position of the PSD on the basis of the broad-based government, as per the Arusha Accords, was to share power with one and all parties. As far as the Arusha Accords were concerned, the PSD accepted that all parties sit around the same table and take part in the same government, including the RPF, for the running of the country during the transitional period, whilst we wait for the elections to be organised for power to be invested in the elected, those that can run the country, by the electorate.</p>

And I was in Ndadabo <stage>(phonetic)</stage> and we were responsible for preparing those rallies and organising them. I was also at Girambo in Bwakiro commune. There, too, we held a rally.

But once I came to the area, the Gishaka centre, people knew that I was from the PSD, and at that time I had some hats, some caps, in the vehicle, and I gave them out to those who wanted them. Those were PSD caps or hats, because I also wanted to show that I had followers in that particular area. But I was not there to organise a rally. I could not organise a rally all by myself.

            <p>I'm seeking a clarification on the structure of the party. I am really confused about the politburo. And it's fair to say that, according to the constitution of the party, there was a politburo which was constituted by the chair, two vice chairpersons and the secretary. Then there was the governing structure at the préfecture level with a regional executive. Then the national congress. What I don't understand is how it shall be -- or how some of them fed into the politburo. That's on the one hand.</p>

But you asked me how often, starting in 1990. In fact, I don't remember how many times. I do know that I didn't go very often, perhaps once a year, perhaps twice, but it was a rare occasion.

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, in the 1960s, when I was still a boy, there were very few people living in Gasharu. Currently, there are people who came from other hills to settle there. But in the 1960s, there was my father, my aunt, my cousins. JX, JE, those witnesses, they lived there. They came before this Tribunal. CGH, his brother, he had a wife, and CGH's mother lived in Gasharu with us. He had two wives in fact, and the other one, her mother -- CGF's mother -- lived just next to Gasharu. Those were the people who were there. At that time, my father was the only Hutu on that hilltop. All the other people were Tutsis. Thereafter, people like Karara came to settle there in Gasharu. My cousins got married; they had children. And so the hilltop -- the hill got bigger; the families got bigger. Hutus from other hills came to settle there amongst the Tutsis. But I don't think there were many Hutus who came. If you will, in 1994, Gasharu had more Tutsis than it did Hutus, even if you do count those Hutus who came to settle from other hills. So that that is the makeup of Gasharu hill, if you will. There's nothing out of the ordinary. There's a small market near Gatara. I had a couple of shops there. People go to drink beer at that market or they go to sell their livestock. There was a small road there. It comes from the main road to Kibuye. It's six or ten kilometres to get there from Kibuye. There's nothing extraordinary about the place. But what makes it known is that it was known as a Tutsi hill since 1963, when there were problems. The neighbouring hills are inhabited by Hutus, and those Hutus, during the '59 revolution, tried to attack that hill. But the hilltop protected itself very well and it didn't have very many problems.</p>

But CGF came to Gasharu a long time afterwards. I don't know him. I don't know him. But he came to settle down in Gasharu quite recently, and I was told that he was the brother-in-law of CGH. The wife is the sister of CGH. The wife of CGF is the sister of CGH. And they are all in Gasharu. But CGF only came recently, while CGX, for example, was there ever since the '60s. His son was born there in the '70s, so that they lived there. It is their area. They were one of the first natives of that hill. So that I am just trying to show you that on that hill there were very few people, and the people who were there were mainly Tutsi, and then gradually Hutu came to ask for land from the Tutsi. I hope I've satisfactorily covered your question, Your Honour. </p>

            <p>Now, Mr. Ndindabahizi, tell me, up to 1994 were there intermarriages between Hutu and Tutsi in Gasharu?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, sir, there was intermarriage between Hutu and Tutsi. I said that my sister, to begin with her, had a Tutsi husband. And I know one Gatwa, whose name should be mentioned in one of the cases here, he had a Tutsi wife. There is a witness who said so. There was also Ngirabanzi <stage>(phonetic)</stage> -- one Ngirabanzi, who was married to Tutsi women. Gatwa had about seven children with that Tutsi woman, and Ngirabanzi also had children -- had many children with a Tutsi wife. And my aunt, Nyirakaza <stage>(phonetic),</stage> was married to a Tutsi since the '20s, because when I was born, my aunt had children already been married, in 1910 or 1915, to a Tutsi. So that marriage between Tutsi and Hutu in that area in Gasharu, and even in certain other neighbouring areas, was not a problem in 1994.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>He called me over the telephone. We had just left each other, because we were together in a bar, and he was a cellule leader, and I used to go to his place <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> because I lived nearby. And that evening we had just left each other about 8:00, 8:30. And when I got home, I heard the telephone ring. It was his telephone call, and he asked me whether I had arrived at home. That's what he said, "Are you at home?" I said, "Yes". And I said, "Why are you calling me?" Because that was not usual. He said, "Look, I have just heard an explosion and I wanted to know whether you managed to get home". Because at that time there were grenade explosions in the city of Kigali. That was very frequent. We would hear that people were shot down at the entrance of their houses, and he thought that that explosion happened very near his house. And he said he just heard an explosion. He wanted to make sure. I told him that I had also heard the explosion, but that the explosion did not take place around my house, sir.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, sir, when he told me that he had just heard an explosion, I believe that immediately he didn't tell me that the president had died, no; he just wanted to know whether I'd arrived home. Several minutes afterwards, he called again and said, "Look, that explosion was the president. His plane has been shot down at Kanombe; so the explosion you just heard was the explosion of the plane of the president that had just been shot down at the time it was landing". It was at that time that I learned about the death of the president -- at around 8:30 in the evening. Now, my reaction, you say? It was no joke, because with the tension all around at that time in the country, especially in Kigali, to hear that the president has just died, it was no joke. It was serious. I got scared. I didn't sleep throughout the night until the morning, myself, my children, my wife, because we were wondering what was going to happen next, because we knew that that event had just occurred at a time when the city was in itself explosive. In Kigali, we were expecting -- we were expecting such things, ominous, bad things. We could not sleep.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, in the morning, there was a communiqué urging people to remain at home, but at around 8:00 or 9:00 -- I can't remember; this was about ten years ago. And it was the watchman that told us that there were soldiers that were going around houses, killing people. So I went out of the house and I left. I left; I went hiding at a neighbour's house not too far away. I went to a neighbour's house. My wife also went out of the house to hide in another neighbour's -- the nearest neighbour, because houses were adjacent. That is where my wife went with two children. And three other children spent the night elsewhere. I went away, 500, 600 metres away, at a neighbour's house to hide. That was my first reaction because I thought that, with the news I had just heard, those people might very well come to my house. And I knew what would happen. With the problems I had experienced, I knew that I was in danger.</p>

            <p>Yes, I was Hutu, Your Honour, but I went to hide because I knew that I was holding a position in society of a burdensome responsibility, and I said to myself that people could come to my house, they could kill me, because people told me that they were going around the first houses in the area. They were going into houses and they were killing everybody. And I was frightened because of my position, because of the position I had within the party and within the ministry. That was why I had to go. I knew that perhaps with that small neighbour of mine, because he was not very well known -- it was a house that -- perhaps the interpreters can help me -- was surrounded by some type of bush. I said to myself that probably those killers would not come to that particular house. But it was just for that time. It was not once and for all that I was going to hide in there. It was just for the time being.</p>

            <p>I am saying that he was not of any significant stature, socially. I didn't know where he worked, but he was not famous. He was not well known. I know -- I knew that he was from one of the Kibuye cellules. So I knew him, but he was not an important man. His house was not big. It was a small house, and I knew that the killers would say to themselves, "Well, in that house there must be somebody important". So I had to make that choice. I had to choose that house, whose fence was some sort of bush, some sort of plants. </p>

            <p>Well, Mr. President, he's called Gahizi, Amon <stage>(phonetic).</stage> That's his name, Gahizi, Amon. Now, I went to his place because he lived in a modest house with a fence of shrubs and I thought that the killers would never think that a little house was inhabited by anybody of importance. And I thought that since it would be viewed like that, I went there. But my wife went to another house, another house next to mine, because we had the same wall between our houses. That house belonged to a warrant officer of the Rwandan army. He was from the Bigogwe <stage>(phonetic)</stage> military camp, and his house was occupied by his wife, children and house help, and my wife went there. And she was thinking that perhaps that house belonged to a soldier, and since it belonged to a soldier, nobody would think about getting into that house. </p>

            <p>Well, I think that it was self-evident the reason why I was scared. I said that I was director of the cabinet of the ministry of finance, and people told me that people were being killed all around my house. You think I should stay in my house? No, I didn't do so. I said to myself, "I could be killed, especially as I belong to a political party that was always said to have been pro-RPF". It was said that PSD was pro-RPF. Do you want me to stay at the house to be killed? No, sir. I was scared about what could have happened, because I heard gunshots in the area. I heard gunshots. I wasn't told, "Look, people have been killed and I should run away". No, I heard the gunshots, and I ran away. And on my flight, I saw soldiers. I saw soldiers go into houses, breaking down doors, killing people. I was scared. I was right to be frightened and to run away. </p>

The RPF, just as the other soldiers went into houses and killed, they killed just like other soldiers. So that seeing that the area, the vicinity, was becoming more and more dangerous, and I had to run away. I had to decide. I decided therefore to leave. I decided to call my wife on the telephone and tell her that I was leaving, and I told her where I was going. I informed her, because people that were living around the RPF barracks and the CND area were running. They were coming towards us. We were near the valley, and I told my wife, "Look here at Amon Gahizi's". And there was a telephone at that soldier's house. I told her, "Look, I am leaving. You also should try to run away because the RPF is outside too -- is out there too". So I left. I immediately left in of the midst, haze, of bullets from all over the place. We didn't know where bullets came from. I was asked whether I should stay within the house. I said no. I was scared; I had to leave, because Gahizi's wife was telling me they were killing important personalities. "If they come here, they will kill you". Sometimes they would tell me to hide in the latrine outside the house. I had to go. I left. I left, and I went to another hill. </p>

            <p>It's difficult to say. Perhaps one kilometre, one-and-a-half kilometres, something like that. I was on foot, and it took me a long time to get there.

            <p>Well, I left Rugando <stage>(phonetic),</stage> and Ugaza <stage>(phonetic)</stage> I went to his house. And after that, the only safe hill was the one opposite, and where -- the only person I knew there was Rafiki. I alerted him, I called him. I called him and said, "Look, I have problems" and I was scared that -- I knew that the RPF soldiers were out in the street and I was coming to his house. I knew that there were people. There were soldiers in his area. Gun shots were very sustained in the area. There was danger everywhere. I didn't want to go too far. I went to Rafiki's. He knew me. He was a member of my party. He was also a colleague from the minister of public works because he was a director of cabinet just like myself, and that was the case. During those bloody and frightening events, as the ones that took place in 1994 in Rwanda, one didn't have a lot of choice. One reacted spontaneously. In the face of death one doesn't think too much.</p>

            <p>When I arrived at his house, there were no problems in his neighbourhood, in the area he lived in. There were no problems. The RPF was in Rugando <stage>(phonetic)</stage> and in Rumera, near the Amahoro Stadium. They were attacking that area, but it was still -- his area was still in tact, but that doesn't mean that there were no problems at all, because when I arrived at his house there were problems inside the house. He had boarded up the house. Everybody had barricaded themselves inside their houses. He felt threatened. He was inside his house, but he wasn't as -- in a spot as dangerous as mine. I didn't -- I didn't say I was going to stay there definitively. It wasn't the last place I was going to stay. We had before us soldiers; we heard gunfire, even up above the CND. Here was an RPF gun shooting people at the presidential guard camp. So we were trying to -- we didn't have a -- we were trying to get away. We didn't have a final solution to what we were going to do. </p>

            <p>Counsel, the situation at the time wouldn't have allowed such a thing. When Rafiki left he closed his whole house down. He left with his wife and all the people, and his wife, in fact, had some problems, she was pregnant in fact. He had to bring her to the hospital where she gave birth that night or the next day. Everybody left the house, t was closed up. Counsel, how could I stay there, or how could I refuse? What could I do otherwise? Was there any other way I could have done things, under those circumstances? He accepted to welcome me into his house, I spent the night there. His wife was pregnant and, in fact, in that neighbourhood I told you there was total insecurity. There was gun shots here and there. Later on -- in fact, we never went back there. The situation became very serious. I could only leave with him. That's the only thing that I could have done. I didn't know anyone else in that neighbourhood. It was dangerous to move about on foot and even by car if I had had one. I decided to go with him.</p>

Rafiki told me that he can't go to that meeting; he couldn't go to that meeting. He couldn't go without François Ndungutse, so we went to go to pick up someone else. Rafiki said that he could not represent the PSD party at the ministry of defence without being accompanied by another person who was also a member of the politburo as he was, a person who was a native of the south region of the country. Rafiki is from the northern region. In his car he said, "Listen Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have some problems. I don't know if I can represent the PSD, I'm afraid. The PSD is -- it's strong hold is in the south and not in the north. I don't want to be accused later on of taking over the PSD party which is a southern-based party". He said, "I have to absolutely go and get Mr. Ndungutse so that he can come with me". So, we went -- we went to Kicukiro in a roundabout way. We went to get Ndungutse who was from Butare. He was a member of the politburo. We went to get him for that reason. If I could just explain. We were at Ndungutse's house, therefore. Rafiki convinced him, but Ndungutse was having problems himself. There were people who wanted to attack him from the outside. Rafiki convinced him, and now he decided to go to the meeting. The meeting that was holding at the ministry of defence, and from there we went to the ministry of defence, there were three of us. I was with them. Two members of the politburo; Rafiki and François Ndungutse <stage>(phonetic),</stage> and then myself. We arrived at the ministry of defence together, and this was in the afternoon, the afternoon of the 8th of April 1994. On that afternoon at around 3 p.m. we were there. And I can't give you the exact time, but it was around 3 p.m. when we arrived there.</p>

            <p>I think I was accompanying them. They weren't accompanying me, but, yes, I was with them. I was with those two persons, and they are both members of the politburo of the PSD. I was only chairman of the party in Kibuye; I was not a member of the politburo. When we arrived, those two members of the politburo would play the game. When they were asked who would represent our party -- first, they were surprised. I was next to them. I was following everything. See, we have -- you have ministries. Who is going to represent us? Who is going to hold those portfolios? That was the question that they asked. The answer was the following: "Well, those people are dead or they've disappeared. Those people who would represent our party are either dead or just disappeared. What are we going to do" they said "with your ministries?" Have I <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> satisfactorily covered the question, or should I go on to tell you what happened next? I think, madam, Your Honour --</p>

That is the one that said they were either dead or they've disappeared, and if you have a proper recollection it was Mugenzi that is the president or the chairman of the PR who was there. And I told you that the meeting didn't have any chairman, visibly. People were seated, people were standing, and Mr. Mugenzi told us, look - when we were asked where our former ministers were, I heard Mr. Mugenzi say, "They are either dead, or they have disappeared". This is the answer we were given, and everybody there insisted because we had all the members of the various committees of the various parties that form the proceeding governments were there. They were all represented except the PSD so they said, "We have finished our work. We have already supplied the names of our ministers, now it's the turn of the ministries who were assigned to the PSD. Now it's up to you, now, to tell us the ministers that were to replace your former ministers that are either dead or disappeared". That was it, Your Honour.</p>

So, there was also another person for PDC, but I do not remember his name. But there were two of them from the PDC, so that if one reckons -- it was the PSD that was missing. So that when we arrived, I was with Ndungutse François and Rafiki, but we -- that day the meeting had ended, we did not take part in the meeting. What we did is what I just said, that was when I was asked a question -- and, of course, what we had to tell each other -- the people we met there that it was the end of the meeting.</p>

Now, the problem was that we had three ministries; the minister of agriculture and lifestyle; the minister of finance; and the minister of public works and energy so that we had to have three directors of cabinet that should have succeeded the former ministers.

            <p>Mr. Ndindabahizi, yesterday we were talking about the afternoon of the 8th of April. You were explaining the circumstances under which you were appointed as Minister of Finance for the interim government. Can you take it up there again and tell the Tribunal what happened following that meeting on the 8th of April, that afternoon, 8th April 1994?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes. I was saying that on the 8th of April 1994, in the afternoon, at around 3 p.m. we were at the defence ministry in Kigali. When we left, we went to the École Supérieure Militaire. There the political parties, the representatives of those parties, met with the crises committee, and they did so to close the day's work. That's it, Counsel.</p>

            <p>Yes, I was there. After giving the names of the PSD ministers, it was decided that we would stay in Kigali, and that for security reasons, therefore, I did not leave. I remained with the others, and I was in that meeting. That meeting was very short, however. After that, we spent the night at the Hotel Diplomate.</p>

            <p>No. We wanted to put a closing to that day's meeting, that meeting which was meant to set up the government. The political parties had to say that the interim government was set up and that work was done and that the next day there would be a swearing-in ceremony. That was the purpose of that meeting, if my memory serves me well. If my memory serves me well, that was the only purpose of that meeting.</p>

            <p>Very well, Mr. Ndindabahizi, now it's the 9th of April in the morning, you are at the Hotel Diplomat. What did you do in the morning, the 9th of April?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>On the 9th of April in the morning I woke up, but I had a problem. In fact, since the 6th of April I had been separated from my family and, as I told you yesterday, I believe my wife and two children had fled towards Kicukiro. I had three other children who had spent the night with another family, of friends of ours. On that morning of the 6th I thought that I should try to do something to get my wife back with me, as well as the two children who were with her. I borrowed a car from François Ndmbutse <stage>(phonetic).</stage> He had a small car. I knew how to drive. I also had a gendarme accompany me, so I could go and get my family in Kicukiro. We were asked to stay at the hotel for security reasons, because the names of the future ministers had already been made public. We were told to stay at the hotel for security reasons, but I ignored those orders because I was very worried. I was worried about the fate of my family. I absolutely, whatever the cost was, had to find them, and I knew I was risking a great deal. I went to try to find them in Kicukiro. My wife, in fact, before the telephones were cut off on the 8th, on the 7th, therefore, of April, she called me to tell me where exactly she was in Kicukiro. So I left to look for my wife in Kicukiro, and I went to the place she told me where she was. She was at a convent. I didn't know that convent, but I asked around and people told me where the convent was. I saw the manager of the convent, who told me my wife had left that night. But she said she didn't go very far.</p>

            <speaker>JUDGE KHAN:</speaker>
            <p>What do you mean convent, by a school or what is this? You just mentioned convent. What was this?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>It was a place where Catholic nuns lived. There's a convent of the Catholic Church, which housed Catholic nuns. There was a nun managing that convent, and that was who I went to see. No, it's not a school, it's a place where the Catholics -- I think Catholics know what that is. But it's a place where young girls who have given themselves to Jesus's service, who don't get married, and they live there and the church houses -- the Catholic Church lodges them there. I'm a Protestant and I don't know too much about all of this, the other church so I can't give you all the explanations I would like to. I'm sorry. Thank you, Your Honour. So the manager of that convent told me that my wife had left the night before. She was very nice to me, and she accompanied me to go to Kicukiro, to the technical school, where there were many refugees there. She thought that perhaps my wife had gone over there. There were Belgian soldiers guarding that place. I asked the soldiers at the roadblock, at the entryway, if I could go in but I was sure to leave the vehicle and the gendarme a bit further away. I did not find my wife there at the technical school. I continued to look for her and in the end I found her. She was on the road towards Mibilizi. She had spent the night on that road. I saw the child, also. I asked, "Where's your mother?" The child went to call mother, and very quickly we all got into the car. I dropped off the nun manager at the convent, and then I immediately went back to Kigali. It was at the very last minute, just before the swearing-in testimony; in fact, it had already begun. I was the last one to come into that meeting. They were looking for me. They hadn't found me. I came in. They immediately gave me a piece of paper and on that piece of paper the oath. The text of the oath that I had to take was on that paper, and I took it immediately.But in the morning, that is what I was doing. And the last thing that happened was the taking of the oath.</p>

            <p>Very well. Two questions come up regarding this morning of the 9th of April. The first, there must have been a combat zone in Kigali and even crimes must have been perpetrated against honest people. How could you go from the Hotel Diplomate, where you were, to Kicukiro, and return unhindered? How is it possible to do that unfettered?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, it was very early in the morning. At about 8:00 the situation had calmed a bit. There was no shooting. It wasn't too far. I think it was some three kilometres, not more. But you must understand me, also, I knew there were risks involved, but I also knew that I had to save my family, even if I was risking a great deal. On that morning, though, there was a bit of calm in the air, nobody was shooting at us, the RPF was next to Amahoro stadium. And on the road towards Kicukiro there were still gendarmes walking about, government gendarmes; this was still in the government controlled zone. That road was still protected and guarded by the gendarmes. I saw them there. I couldn't have done anything differently. Without my family, I wouldn't have had nothing. I took the risk.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Very well, the second question that comes up is that you found your child and your wife, you were in a car, there's a gendarme with you, why didn't you flee right then and there, instead of falling into the trap of the government? Why didn't you just flee on the spot?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>You've asked me that question since yesterday. And counsel for the Prosecution also asked Lugan, the expert Lugan that question, "Why didn't Ndindabahizi flee? He had just gotten a car, he was protected by a gendarme, he should have taken advantage of that occasion to flee." What I tell you to that is that if you knew what was going on in Kigali where we were, if you knew what was going on, on the road that I was travelling on -- do I know what is going on everywhere throughout in Kigali, because to get out you have to get out of Kigali. The RPF was present; they had surrounded the city. There were killers running about the city killing people. There were roadblocks erected by those killers and by Presidential Guard soldiers. I was running a risk of running into those people. Once again, it was total insecurity. And then a friend, a member of our party, who gave me his car -- he was with his wife and his children. He stayed at the Hotel des Diplomate. So, was I to leave with his car and abandon him there with his children? That would be too egocentric. He gave me a vehicle. Did he do it so that I could flee? How much petrol was still in the tank? With that much petrol how far could I go and with a gendarme, a gendarme assigned to me by Rafiki? If I decide to flee, will that gendarme agree to accompany me as I flee? Would he agree to do that? I don't know.</p>

            <p>Yes, indeed. That was what was said. That was what was decided. It was decided that the minister responsible for security -- they requested to take measures to stop the violence. The minister for security affairs, that is the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, to those ministries it was said something should be done. And seems we thought that the youth of the MRND was involved. We also asked the leader of that party to do something to intervene, so that the situation could be put under control. People are told to calm down, and prevented from committing crimes. But that was only for Kigali city, because outside Kigali city and in the hinterland of the country we did not have any information as to what was happening and, indeed, there was not even a telephone available.</p>

            <p>Now, Counsel, I told you that we were on a Saturday, that was Saturday, the 9th. It was a weekend and the next day was the 10th, a Sunday. So I do not see why you are asking me whether I did have anything to do with state finances. What finance are you talking about? What national affairs are you talking about? This was a weekend. There were no activities. All that there was was what we heard that was happening in town, the war, the crisis, so that there was nothing else to think about, in terms of financial management. There was no time for that. It was not possible for me to do anything. Perhaps you could make your question clearer.</p>

On the 11th of April there was another meeting, and that meeting was held with the préfet of the préfectures, and I did take part in that meeting as well.

            <p>The meeting of the 10th, I do recollect that it was a question of obtaining information concerning the security situation within the country. It was decided -- it was decided to call in the préfet to discuss the security situation. The préfets, therefore, came the following day, that is the day after, that is the day after the 11th, and the purpose was to discuss the security situation. There was no other purpose, other than that. There was nothing else to do, because the country was engulfed in fire and blood, especially in Kigali, so that it was absolutely necessary for us to be put in the know as to what was happening in the country. That was the purpose of the meeting of the 11th.</p>

            <p>The government left the capital on the 12th in the morning; but, to my knowledge, no reason was adduced for that. So that I went to see my children, who were at a friend's at Kiovu, that was at around 500 metres from the hotel, and when I came back I realised that everybody had gone away. I left. I asked as to what was happening. I was told that they had left. So, there was no official information as to the reasons why the government left Kigali. The government left Kigali without I <stage>(sic)</stage> being told what was happening, and we simply took note. It was later on that we were told that it was for security reasons that the government left.</p>

            <p>I did say to you that in the morning of the 9th I had borrowed a vehicle. I borrowed a vehicle, because I had none myself. There were two vehicles at the house, though, the driver, a car and the official car, and I had left them there at the house when I was on the run on the 7th of April. When I was to go and get my wife I had to borrow a vehicle, but to leave Kigali I always had to resort to arrangements because, once again, I had to use a vehicle that I had to borrow. A vehicle I borrowed from Pastor Twagiariayezu, who was the bishop of the Presbyterian church. His wife was the godmother of one of my daughters and one of my daughters was there between the 6th and the 9th. He was not there on the 9th. He had gone to Kibuye. When the plane of the president was shot down he was unable to come back. It was, therefore, his wife who gave me the keys to his vehicle, which I used to take my family from Kigali to Gitarama. I hope I have covered your question.</p>

So we left in a convoy. On the way I was given some children by another family that I loaded in the vehicle, and I went on with them to Gitarama. That was in the morning.</p>

            <p>The woman -- I knew her, and then when I met her on the road in between Gitarama and Kigali I stopped to see what was happening, because there were people on the road. There were many people who were leaving, because in Kigali there was fighting and people were leaving, were beginning to leave Kigali in great numbers. So I saw the lady and I stopped. She was crying. She was crying, and I asked her what was happening. She told me, "Listen, my husband has just been killed." I also knew the husband, but in the vehicle there were no seats available. She decided to give me the two children that I loaded on the vehicle and we went along together. So she gave me her two children. She had one child on her back and another on foot, these were very small children, and she asked me to help and I accepted to help. She even told me that the husband and her father had just been killed around Gatsata; that is on the road from Kigali to Byumba. But it was in the neighbourhood of Kigali that they were killed.</p>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, really, to tell you, as Minister of Finance, with the terrible situation that obtained at that time, to tell you that I did anything was to say probably too much. I cannot -- what can I tell you? I'm a Minister of Finance. Perhaps even the other ministers, was there anything for them to do? I came to Gitarama and the government set up in Murambi, and at the same time there were many civil servants that had left Kigali, they also came to settle down in Gitarama. So that the first thing that was there to be done, the first question that was put to the Minister of Finance, was to determine how the people were going to survive and live. People had left Kigali on the 6th, that is the 12th, some of them left the 6th, others the 12th, and normally salaries are paid out at around that time and the salaries are paid through accounts, and civil servants did not cash their monies, because of the unfortunate events that cost us the life of President Habyarimana. And upon arrival at Gitarama, people had nothing. They had no money. Some of them came here without their clothes, so that I was asked to do something about it. Those that were to settle down in Murambi will have somewhere to stay, but what were they going to eat? What were they going to do? This was what I was asked to do. And I tried to find some money to help all those people and to try to see to it that the banks opened, at least the banks at Gitarama are open, to be able to serve those that had accounts and money in their accounts. That was the first thing I was asked to try to do, and that was the first thing I tried to do. Now, I do not know whether I should recount my day-to-day activities, because the government council had even asked me to secure state funds so that state funds were safely kept. And I did precisely that. I ensured that the governor of the national bank would do that, and he did that. The banks came to settle down in Gitarama, and they opened for business, and they started serving the customers that had monies deposited with them. The customers were served, those that were to be paid. We didn't take into account the fact that the money was to go to accounts, we simply gave out instructions that monies were paid out on the basis of lists established, because there were the various ministries in Gitarama and the managers of the various ministries were in Gitarama, and it was easy to establish salaries because managers of the ministries, for the Minister of Finance, for example, was responsible for the salary distribution on the basis of lists established by the various ministries. That is a quite tedious type of work because of the disorder that obtained and at the time we had to know who was entitled to be paid, and payment was not only made in Gitarama, there were teachers and there were civil servants that were not in Gitarama. That's why elsewhere in the country we had to serve them as well and all that had to be supervised. And then, of course, there was the problem of the purchase, the procurement of food and supplies and contracts to be passed with suppliers that supplied various commodities. There were advances to be paid to all the suppliers. The Ministry of Finance, who was solicited to a great extent during that period, since the other ministries -- the other ministers -- because of what happened, had been done to the Ministry of Finance. I cannot tell you I signed this order or that order on this day or that day. I do not remember the secrets with which I worked.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, it was still the same set of circumstances. We left Kigali precipitously; Gitarama too. It was one morning that we were told that the RPF was in the vicinity of Kabaya and everybody started running away. I ran away with others, and where did I run to? How did I get away? I had some in-laws in Gitarama, in this city or the town Gitarama, I had in-laws and it was right in that city the fighting was going on, and I was happy I came to take over that particular town. And it was not easy for me because I had to evacuate that family -- that is the family of my in-laws -- with many, many members, about 20 of them. I had to evacuate that family, transport them to Kibuye, and then I had to go back to get my wife to be able to move onto Gisenyi the following day. This was what I was able to do. Probably you want some more details, so this is how we got to Gisenyi.</p>

            <p>The way to Gisenyi -- I hope you remember the road network in Rwanda. I left Gitarama and went up to -- that is on the Kibuye road, I went up to Rukabano and came back to Gitarama to collect the rest of the family and drop them at Rukabano. I left that family at Rukabano with a friend, and I did know that my family was in Kirinda, because in May I had sent my wife and my children, and also the children of the préfet of Gitarama, I sent all of them the Kirinda, the state of Kirinda. So I had to go and get them in Kirinda, and drove them to Gisenyi through Ruhengeri, that is the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road. The next day I got to Gisenyi with my wife and the children, the five children and the children of the préfet Uwizeye Fidéle, that is the préfet of Gitarama. We arrived there on the 3rd of June, I believe. That is the way we arrived at Gisenyi and tried to get accommodation, and we tried to locate the government, while I tried to locate the government and rejoin the others in Gisenyi.</p>

We felt pressure from the RPF, and I wanted to evacuate my family, to put it away from the town. But since my family was living with the préfet in Gitarama, when the préfet's wife saw that I was evacuating my family, they postulated that I had some other means, and they said, "Well, can you take our children along with you?" Well, I believed that was not a problem. I said that the children should stay together and, therefore, I sent them to Kirinda upon the request of their parents. </p>

            <p>It is difficult, Counsel, but the document exists. You can always refer to it. The préfet welcomed the prime minister and then welcomed the participants. He spoke of problems of insecurity that existed in the préfecture in 1992 and 1993, and that there were also security issues throughout the country in April of 1994, but that security was being restored. And that activities had rebegan <stage>(sic),</stage> but there were problems. There were problems of abandoned property that people wanted to divide up amongst themselves. He spoke of those types of problems. And that's all I really remember.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, the prime minister spoke, and he talked about the 27th-of-April document. The MRND also spoke. The MDR also took the floor. And that at one point during their speech, I heard that they continued to repeat that there were accomplices. The MDR said there will be no more accomplices within the government. Now, I knew that people were being massacred and they were being accused of being accomplices. I thought I had to react to that. I reacted, saying, "We're not accomplices". Somebody else reacted after me, someone from the same party -- from the other one, the other person who was in the MDR. That person also reacted. "Ndindabahizi's just said this and that". I think it was Rwabukwisi who said that, who was repeating what I said. So I reacted to that, to try to calm people down. I said, "Trust me. We're not against you, we're not going to kill you". These people were afraid of the RPF. The RPF was advancing, and as the RPF advanced, they thought they would find accomplices and they would react against them. So I had to react to that, Counsel. That is what I wanted to say, Counsel.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>But deep down, why, at all costs, did you not want to be considered as an accomplice of the RPF before the 6th of April? Was your party close to the RPF or why did this come about?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, it was close to the RPF. That's why people were immediately killed, starting on the 6th of April. Our party -- and we were accused of being with the enemy, being accomplices with the enemy. That was it. It was very dangerous for us and for me if people would continue to say, "There will be no more; we will not allow the RPF's accomplices to be in our government". Because the RPF's accomplices in the government, who were they? How many governments were there in Rwanda that had RPF accomplices in them? In the previous government, how many parties were there which were accomplices to the RPF? I only think there was one, that one which fell on the 6th of April. And we knew what became of them, what fate awaited them. These people continued to say, "RPF accomplices, RPF accomplices". This was very dangerous, and they called the PSD accomplices.</p>

            <p>At that time I did not see any roadblock. I didn't see one, but when they said that the roadblock was between the house of Karara and further up, I decided to leave the vehicle at Gitaka. To get to my house, it's not between those two places; it's some 20 or 30 metres below. So I stopped the car there and I walked up the hill. And I think we looked at the photos that we talked about in this courtroom.</p>

            <p>When I arrived, there were people on the road, and when they saw me, they seemed to be very concerned, worried. They talked to me about their concerns. The houses on the hilltop -- and you can see them from Gitaka centre -- were desolate. I told you Gasharu is mostly inhabited by Tutsis. Probably 80 to 90 per cent of the inhabitants were Tutsis, so you can only imagine what the hill looked like. And in Gitaka I could see that many houses were destroyed. So the situation was very much abnormal, was not normal. People were cold. I came across problems I had never seen before. Such problems had taken place in the 1960s, but the people who were there were mostly young people. There were a few elderly, but most of the people had never seen such serious tragedy. They were worried.</p>

            <p>At the Gitaka centre I yet again met a certain number of people, a certain number of people who had gathered there. And I talked to them a little because some of them put certain questions to me. I also asked certain questions. I do remember a person, an elderly man that I knew, who was telling me that there was a woman that he had hid somewhere and was asking me what to do. I told him, "Listen, why do you want to kill people, innocent people, just like that? Who gave you the right to do so?" And he asked me, "What am I going to do?" No, he asked me, "Couldn't you tell these people to leave my wife alone, so that she can come out of hiding?" I told those people, "Listen, leave this woman alone; let her come out alive". I did say so. I also talked to Karara, one Karara -- he didn't come here. For a long time, I thought Karara was in charge of a cellule, but I've always thought that he was in charge of a cellule. I also knew that he was a friend to some members of my family, so that I thought that he was still in charge of Gasharu. So I asked him to tell me what happened, but he didn't tell me; he didn't know what to say. So in anger I loaded him on the vehicle. I was also told about one boy who allegedly killed about ten women. So that when we were talking, I was trying to see what I could do because he was dangerous. He had disappeared at that particular point in time. So that I had told the people, "Listen, you should not kill". But they were telling me that that was not the problem. It was not the people of Gasharu, that created the problem; it was people from the neighbouring cellules, the cellules neighbouring Gasharu that created the problem. Because when I told you about Gasharu, I told you that Gasharu was a hill inhabited by Tutsis, mainly. But all around, on the other hills, those hills were inhabited by mainly Hutu. So that that was the picture, and it was thus that I left Gasharu. In the afternoon, it was that I left Gasharu. I left Gasharu with that man called Karara.</p>

That was a man, a rather unpleasant man, who was about 20 years old, but he was unkempt. He was a dirty man; he looked like a vagrant, and upon looking at him you'll see that he didn't even wash his hair. </p>

            <p>No, he was pointed out to me. I was told, "Here is Gatete. He was the one that was killing". And when people started to say that he was the one who was killing, he disappeared. He disappeared, and he went away. But Karara did not try to hide or to run away. He remained with me. And I went on in the same vehicle as him. And I told myself that he was going to give me explanations. But the other one disappeared. Karara was with me.</p>

            <p>Counsel, what do you mean by a speech? You get to a place, people are unhappy, people tell you this and that happened. Unfortunately, that was not a political rally. I talked to them, and many of them knew me. Those were old friends, people who lived all around the hill, some on the hill. So that there was no place for any speech. One cannot say, "Ndindabahizi, Great Ndindabahizi is here; he's going to make a speech". No. I came and talked to them, just as anybody would talk to brothers. I had no political speech to make. But I told them that, "Look, this is what I want to tell you: please do not kill". I even went much further. I said something that I should not have said, perhaps. I did say, "If somebody kills, that person should also be killed". And that was not what I wanted to say -- really meant. I told them to stop killing innocent people, and I asked them to tell me who authorised them to kill innocent people.</p>

            <p>Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have a few remaining questions for you. Let's try to move ahead. Let's go back from your -- to your departure from Gisenyi in July 1994 and your move to Goma in Zaire. Where did you go in Goma?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>There weren't many homes in Goma. Everybody -- practically everyone had left Gisenyi and Ruhengeri. Those areas were empty. There were two or three million Rwandans in a city of 200,000, that housed 200,000. So we needed a place to stay. We were looking. I went to a small hotel called Mask for a few days. I felt that in the hotel it was more unsafe than outside, and so I went out and stayed with a Zairian friend in Goma.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Can you say that that government existed, that it still existed outside of Rwanda? When we left, most of the ministers had disappeared. We were in the government by title only, but you didn't see anyone. Everyone was on their own trying to lodge their families somewhere and the governor wrote us an official letter even, saying that the former dignitaries of the Rwandan regime had to leave the border area of Rwanda and Zaire; that is to say, Goma. Everybody practically had left and had to leave. I stayed, though, up until August, but really, when you say "a member of the government", if I was a member of the government while I was there, or even after, it would be saying too much. And at any rate, my duties -- people continued to call me the minister of finance because we had deposited money in Zairian banks, and I was asked to continue to closely follow developments of that case. The money was frozen. That was it, basically, Counsel.</p>

The Rwandan contacted me to put me in touch with those two persons who were coming from Kigali, and they said they were members of the ICTR staff.</p>

            <p>Yes, Mr. President, at this stage, I must remind you that the person whose name appears on that document, was Witness DX. Witness DX was the subject of a motion by the Defence on the 27th of October 2003. We filed it under 92 bis under the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. We filed it, the said motion, under 92 bis <stage>(E),</stage> respecting the time delays, 14 days ahead of time. And it is accompanied by the written testimony of Witness DX. There was no opposition on the part of the Prosecutor under 92 bis <stage>(E).</stage> Any opposition had to be served within seven days. Consequently, we believe that there is no obstacle to the admission of this written testimony as a Defence exhibit. This written testimony will confirm Ndindabahizi's statements regarding his meeting with ICTR staff between 1996 and 1998: '96, '97 and '98. That written statement also contains other information regarding the circumstances, political and historical, of the genocide. It also deals with the morality of the Accused person. DX's written testimony is in conformity with 92 bis <stage>(A)</stage>
              <stage>(e)</stage> and <stage>(a)</stage> and <stage>(b)</stage> and also <stage>(c).</stage> Lastly, the testimony that we have presented respects the provisions of Article 92 bis <stage>(B).</stage> Consequently, and since the Prosecutor did not oppose the admission of that document seven days ahead of time, I think it is the right time to ask the Chamber to admit this written statement as the next Defence exhibit. </p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>The first team was a two man team, and the third person was the Rwandan I spoke about. And they came in September to see me. The Rwandan introduced them to me, and he told me that those investigators wanted my cooperation in the investigations on certain files that they were investigating, certain investigations that they were conducting; that is what I was told. We didn't immediately decide what to do. They said that they would come back after.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Did you accept to cooperate with those investigators?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, first we discussed the conditions. So the Rwandan who brought them to me told me that those conditions -- they accepted, and after that I was not opposed in any way. But I only gave them some conditions and they accepted those. It wasn't cooperation in the sense you understand it here, outside. Prosecution staff said first, you know, you can plead guilty and then we'll collaborate. That's not the kind of collaboration or cooperation I'm talking about. They wanted me to work as an investigator, in a sense, within their team. They had an office in Nairobi and that is what they wanted. So, we had a discussion. They said, "We're going to Kigali and when we come back, we'll tell you what our decision is". And towards the end of the year, in November, but I don't remember the date. Starting in November, we began to meet and that Rwandan, that I mentioned, was also there and he was their collaborator.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>During those meetings you had, were you -- ever made written statements? Were you heard as a suspect or a witness?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>No, as a witness. I was not a suspect. They told me they had verified everything in Rwanda and that there was nothing charged against me. So they wanted me to integrate into their team and help them to establish the truth on what happened in Rwanda. So I was not a suspect, they didn't see me as such. And if they thought me as a suspect, I don't believe they would have accepted the conditions that I laid out, even though they didn't in the end honour those conditions later on. But at any rate, we had a verbal agreement, and that was not respected. But I was not a suspect, Counsel.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>I was surprised to see those here before this Tribunal. Other witnesses who came before this Chamber, before presenting their written statements, are asked if those are signed and if it's their own statement, if the signature at the bottom of the document is their true signature. When I was given the document, I found that it was abnormal. I read it, and what I found inside it should have been corrected. I was never told that they were recording or that they were taking notes. I don't know. I don't know how that document was introduced before this Chamber without me seeing it beforehand, and without me having an opportunity to verify whether it was true or false.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>No, Counsel. I was not a suspect. We worked together as collaborators, but I was not a suspect. I think the problem with that document is that when you re-read it, you don't even know who wrote it. The names of the investigators aren't even on the document. Some of the dates of the interviews are not there. There are blanks in the hand-written document. Who put those blanks in? Perhaps, it's the problem of the translator who is supposed to translate. There are just contradictions and things I did not say. For example, "You were at the meeting in Kibuye presided by President Sindikubwabe". If I was given that document in Nairobi, so that I could be able to correct it and even sign it and make it my own, it would have been better, more desirable. But here, I've been brought here, and references made to that document and this a problem. But that issue of an attorney, no, I was never assisted by an attorney. I was not even being told that I was being recorded and if I was asked if the conversations could be recorded, I said, "No". It was not an investigation on me that they were conducting.</p>

            <p>In 1996, Mr. President, towards the end of that year. One was called Gilbert and the other Haruna. They had set up their office at a hotel in Nairobi, the Nairobi Safari Club. It's just next to the Nairobi University. That is where they had set up their offices, and we would see each other on a regular basis. And the content of that document was not what was said. They said I was with them from '76, November -- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 1996, 1997, 1998. We were always together during those years, all the time, until we separated for reasons that I could give.</p>

The names of the investigators are not the same as those just referred to by the witness.

This is a document that contains erasures hand-made erasures, Mr. President said that the names of the investigators, I just gave are different from these ones. I am saying that this document of the 30th of November 1996, doesn't show the names of the investigators. I do not even see my signature. I see that the document was corrected by hand; these are mistakes or the anomalies that I have pointed out. And, this document that I am referring to, I know this document even if some of the contents that are to be corrected because I did not see it and I did not sign it. It was Mr. Gilbert - - Mr. Haruna that were with me so that their names should be mentioned here together with my signature had I seen the document beforehand. As far as the others are concerned, for the other document since there are other documents are in English and French, the other document is the minutes of a meeting of the former minister of finance, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi from the 8th to the 11th of July, 1st, 2nd and 3rd August 1997 by Shadely and Drack <stage>(phonetics)</stage> and I do not know these people but I know that there were people who came to see me in Nairobi but, and who were members of the team that was working in Nairobi and who were telling me that they wanted some information concerning funding of finances, how we managed our funds in 1994. And it was that team that was working with Cherebe, and it was Juveal, who was in charge of the Nairobi team. He was the one working within that Rwandan, and he was the one that brought in the other teams that were specialised in one or the other respect. That is it, Mr. President.</p>

            <p>The problem, Mr. President, is that I did say that I was with those people from 1996 to 1998 and that they only opted for several dates to introduce as evidence against Ndindabahizi here. Perhaps they were all the interviews that should come in on cross-examination, and I don't know why they chose only these documents here. They were the ones that took notes. Perhaps I would have also tendered manuscripts that I prepared because I was taking notes. I did not know that they were recording me; they did not even afford me the opportunity of checking what I said. Those people never gave me the opportunity and they made use of the fact that I assisted them to accuse me by using documents I had prepared myself.</p>

They started by threatening me. In 1998, I do not have the precise date; it was in 1998 that they started threatening me.

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well the commitments are initially, they said to me that I had taken refuge there, "Your family is not in security. If you accept to work with us the first thing by the way, is that we put your family in a safe place. Tell us a country of your choice that is safe where we can send your family immediately?" The second thing because I did talk to them about the security of my family that was back in Rwanda and was my brother and they told me that they worked in Rwanda and they would ensure the security of those people that remained in Rwanda and that therefore there was no problem.The third thing they said that, "Well as far as we are concerned, investigators are paid, and you are not going to work free of charge. We are not going to ask you to work free of charge we have salaries as investigators." And they told us that for that purpose that they needed a written contract which they said they were preparing. So that were the promises that they made to me and each and every time I reminded them, they told me, "Well, please wait, we are waiting for the person who was responsible to finish what he was doing". So they asked me all the time to wait. Now when the time came for them to ask me where the, "The trouble, well, Mr. Ndindabahizi you are no longer too useful to us because we have people that can tell us what you can't tell us." So that I changed, they said that we want a statement from you according to which Bagosora appointed you as minister, "We want that statement from you," so that I understood that things have started changing since they wanted me to state that it was Bagosora that appointed me as a minister. I said to myself, "Well, I do not understand." I went back to my friend who was the go-between and said, "Well, what is happening?" He went to see them and they said that there was no problem but he had a concrete agreement with them and that they were even doing something in Rwanda. And that they would call to talk about the problems so that we can continue working but at the end of it all, it didn't work out. Then they told me, "Look, Mr. Ndindabahizi that is all. You didn't want to sign the statements according to which it was Bagosora that appointed you minister. You know, by the way that the Rwanda government is looking for, you know that the Tribunal is looking for you. You know that the government of Kenya has not given you asylum. You should therefore look for protection. If you do not want to be protected by signing this statement according to which Bagosora appointed you minister, well, it is up to you. And moreover the Tribunal has no money to pay for these things so that if you do not want to fulfil the conditions, we are laying down, we have other people that are more interesting than you and that is the end of it."I saw that that was the end of the road with those threats and finally they came out and said before leaving, it was on the 12th floor of that hotel in Nairobi. We were six that was presided over by Gilbert Morrissete and they told, "Look Mr. Ndindabahizi you should know that they had just arrested people in Nairobi that they call 'Operation Naki'". They said to me, "Mr. Ndindabahizi we arrested some people in Nairobi. Now, on the next list, your name will be there. Get ready full stop." Then I reacted rather badly because I told them, "Look, I am with you here. Why don't you arrest me now? I have been with you why should you wait if I am a criminal?" And they asked me to go away from their office. And, and that was the last difficult moment I had with them apart from the fact that they called from the telephone. Later on they called again to say, "Could you sign this paper and bring it back to us according to which paper Bagosora appointed you as a minister?"I did not do so. Prosecutor is here but I do not remembering signing any such document. It was at time that I told my friend, "Look things were all wrong. And that the people I was dealing were not honest with me." I talked at length because you asked me to explain.</p>

He said, "For the rest of your life, you will be in jail because you did not want to corroborate". So I stayed in Nairobi, and later on, I went to Belgium to seek asylum.</p>

            <p>Now, I followed my wife who had gone there to seek political asylum. She left in 1999 and in the year 2001, first of all, I waited for Shereha to come and jail me for the rest of my life, and it was four years '98, '99, 2000,. I said to myself, "Well, I must move on, I must go to Europe. And in Europe and in Belgium, I will not be in hiding. I would not go to Europe to hide myself. I went in seeking asylum." And I sought asylum and I was on verge of seeking asylum because I was arrested in my house just as I had obtained provisional documents to stay in Belgium, at least provisionally.</p>

            <p>Mr. President, I am quite surprised because I filed this motion through the registry on the 27th of October 2003, and was recorded by the registry. The stamp of the registry is dated 27th October of the year 2003, Mr. President.</p>

            <p>So if the registry could just double check a little bit what happened to this document to which it was -- to whom it was distributed the channels it followed et cetera. The Prosecution will look into the Prosecution files, and, I think, Mr. Phillips, if you could ask your French-speaking colleagues in the Prosecution to glance through it all night and that would be helpful.</p>

            <p>All right.

You will see that there are not very much to translate. There are only some words like son, daughter, grand parents and so far, but if one of the English translators could just go through the document and give Mr. Ndindabahizi a document with a handwritten French explanation of the few words in English which are not Kinyarwandan names and then he can look at this overnight and feel comfortable with the document. </p>

            <p>Mr. Ndindabahizi, I'm going to continue asking you questions. Sir, is it your testimony, sir, that you, between 1976 and 1981, never visited the TRAFIPRO offices or shop in Kibuye préfecture? Is that your testimony, sir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I said that from '76 to '81, I was head of the financial services at TRAFIPRO, but that I was not in charge of the stores, so that I therefore didn't go to the TRAFIPRO stories. I did not go to those stores in Kibuye, sir.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>I know that in each préfecture, there was at least one TRAFIPRO store, but I did not count, so I cannot give you a figure as such. But in every préfecture, you had at least one store, sir, but there are other préfectures that had two stores. Some even had three, especially the Kigali préfecture. There was one at Kigali, one at Yamata <stage>(phonetic),</stage> one at Kabuga, so that it all depended on the level of activities of TRAFIPRO, in terms of its branch network. I did not count. Each year, one store would be opened here and there. I did, really, not count.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>I'm saying that, perhaps except for the opening of one or the other stores, because one opened stores and there were inaugural ceremonies for the new stores that opened, and to those inaugural stores, everybody was invited. But I did not go into any store for work. I attended inaugural ceremonies for certain stores.</p>

            <p>Well, it all depended on the magnitude of the work to be done. When it was a big company, the accounts were quite sizeable and the operations were -- the accounts operations were many and multifarious, and it would require time, and we stayed for the time required. But for a small company, for example, one could be there for one, two weeks, because we were a team of four to five people.

            <p>That would not be correct, sir, what you are saying, because in '91, we didn't have any political ambitions as such. In the country, as the parties were not there -- we were still under a single-party system; that was MRND. And I left when the parties had not yet been created. I left for personal reasons. I was working at the ministry of planning, and at a certain time I realised that I had to leave the civil service to go into the private sector.

I didn't know what was going to come about, sir. But when the political parties were created, everybody was interested. But at the time I left the civil service, it was not the case. It was for the purpose of moving into the private sector, for work in the private sector. That is all, sir.</p>

            <p>Mr. President, I did say that I did not recognise the entire content of the document, because those that prepared this document never allowed me the opportunity of reading the document for possible correction of things I did not say. I cannot, therefore, take it that this was my point of view at the time we had the interviews with the investigators. The investigators worked with us for two, three years, 1996, '97, '98, but at no time did they afford me the opportunity of reviewing their recordings or their manuscripts, if there were any. So that I do not know whether I did say -- I did make such utterances. I know it was a question of opposition parties, but to say that there was a division into two, MRND or PR <stage>(sic),</stage> it would be tantamount to my making a mistake. If I were to state that that party had been divided into two, whereas that was not the case -- I know that ministers were proposed to serve in the government from that party. There was no other group from that party that proposed other members, as was the case for the MR -- MDR or PR. So that I cannot say that I made such an utterance, because I had no grounds for that in view of the fact that there was no division at all, as far as I was concerned, sir.</p>

            <p>I don't know how to answer that question. I told you I went to Rafiki's house. The neighbourhood where I was, was the theatre of combat. Rafiki, who lived on another hilltop in front of mine, he was in a place that was safer, and I went there for safety reasons. I don't know how you're saying he was better protected than I. I didn't see him benefiting from any special protection. I went for safety reasons, but there were still security fears. I was fleeing as I was on my way to his house.</p>

The minister of public works, Félicien Gatabazi, had been killed in February of that same year. He had been assassinated, and a replacement had not yet at that time been appointed.

That is what I stated before this Chamber. That is very clear. Rafiki asked me to go with him. He told me that he had just been invited to participate in a meeting, a meeting convening the political parties, so he asked me to accompany him. Nobody else did.</p>

            <p>I was not a member of the politburo. I confirm that. But Rafiki asked me to go with him, with him to the ministry of defence. He was told that a meeting of the political parties was being held there. I don't see why questions should arise out of this. Perhaps you can invite Rafiki before this Chamber to tell you why. "Why Ndindabahizi? Since he wasn't a member of the politburo, why did you ask him to go with you?" That is for him to answer. At any rate, you asked me to be brief. And I even said before this Chamber, Rafiki had closed up his house. Even if he hadn't told me to come with him, I don't know how I could have gone out of Kigali, because it was a difficult situation there, and when he asked me to go with him, I accepted his invitation. Whether or not I committed an error in doing so, that is an entirely different question.</p>

            <p>Karamira refers to Hutu moderates, like Twagiramungu, as puppets of the RPF. He talks about unifying into one effective Hutu mass -- stand up, take appropriate action; help look for what is within us, the concept of Hutu solidarity and the need to avoid fighting one another. Now, this is a man who was seated in a meeting where you turned up and agreed to be part of the government; was he not, sir? Just yes or no. </p>

All I know is that instructions were issued at the end of the month of April. They were distributed to all préfectures. But my duties as minister of finance did not enable me to visit the various préfectures to know what was happening in the various préfectures and how the various instructions were being carried out. I know that as far as Kigali is concerned, when we left on the 12th of April, there was fire and brimstone in the city. The RPF came out as early as the 7th of April in the afternoon, and fighting was rife throughout the country. So that we went out to Gitarama to settle down there. How can I tell you that the killing stopped? Whereas there was fighting all around in Ruhengeri, Byumba, Kigoma préfectures. I do not know. Ask me about something that I can answer to. Could you be more precise, more accurate, more pointed? Perhaps the minister for home affairs could give you more adequate answers -- he's here -- or the minister of justice or the minister of defence.

            <p>No, that is not what we were told. I was at the meeting and that was not what we were told as being the reason for his dismissal. That is the reason given to us by his political party, because the préfets were appointed, or nominated, by the political parties. The political parties -- I mean, the préfets couldn't just be dismissed like that. It is the political parties that nominate their préfets. And if a political party doesn't nominate you, it is up to the political party. That is the decision of the political party, not the government. The government applies or carries out the decisions of the party, as far as préfets are concerned, at any rate, ever since the first multiparty government, sir.</p>

You should, rather, say that I did not have any means, and I had to sort out some means. I said so here. That was the case. I was left to sort myself out. Who said so? When I got to the Hôtel des Diplomates, everybody had left. Nobody said, "Look, we should meet for this or that purpose." I fended for myself.

It was in the morning at about nine, ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th that we left. It was in the morning. And the reason given to us -- that is when we left Kigali. At the Hôtel des Diplomates, we were told that the city of Kigali was surrounded by RPF troops, and that the danger was that we would be trapped in the city. And this is what was explained to us when we got to Gitarama. But to say that the ministers stayed at the Hôtel des Diplomates, I do not know how many ministers spent the night at the Hôtel des Diplomates, because some of them had gone elsewhere and fled elsewhere. They had come for the swearing-in exercise, but they were not there at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 9th of April. When we left, we left on the 12th for Gitarama, and that was during the day, sir.</p>

            <p>I would not say yes or no, sir. Let me explain to you. Now, those reports, if there were any, were not discussed at the cabinet meetings. The prime minister had appointed a committee, a committee of ministers, certain ministers responsible for overseeing or studying those reports whenever those reports were sent in. So that there was a group of ministers, appointed by the prime minister, who were responsible for the study of such reports. That committee was chaired by Kambanda himself, and there was his intelligence service; there was the minister of justice; there was the minister of defence, among other ministers. So that those ministers were responsible for those reports. There was no discussion in cabinet. There was a special committee chaired by Kambanda.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>I can explain, because I was in that meeting when the decision was made to replace them. I'd say that the préfets represent political parties. So if someone is a préfet, his party puts his name forward. In April 1994, the PL party requested that the préfecture -- that the préfet in its préfecture be transferred, that its préfet represented should be transferred. It was in Butare. The PL party wanted, instead of Butare, Kibungo. The préfet in Kibungo was a PSD. The president -- or the chairman, rather, of the PL party explained that he had agreed with the chairman of PSD, François Ndungutse, to change, to swap préfectures. Kibungo would go to the PL and Butare to the PSD. The reason for that was that Butare had many PSD members. The PL chairman believed that most of his members were in Kibungo préfecture, so he asked for that swap to be made. He presented the case to the government, and the government did not object. So the préfet -- well, Kibungo, the préfet of Kibungo, was not chased out, but préfets have to be from -- a native of that préfecture. They needed someone native to Kibungo. The PSD needed to look for someone from Butare to replace Habyarimana. So, Kibungo, it was automatic, there was no problem. He left his post, and there was another person from Kibungo who was just appointed. That is what I know, and that is how things happened.</p>

            <p>The situation in Gitarama, sir, let's move on very quickly now. Gitarama, where the government was at the time, Préfet Fidele, that you saw in Kibuye, now, he was having problems, was he not, and he brought those problems to the attention of the government, did he not? Was the government able to help him, to your knowledge, and if so, why did he flee to Kibuye and was subsequently replaced? Can you help me with that, sir?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Yes, I will do so very willingly. I knew the préfet very well, because he welcomed my family whilst the government was in Gitarama. I told you that he gave his children over for me to watch, in June. So I do know what kind of problems he was having. That préfet had political problems, mostly problems of competition between the parties. Gitarama was a majority of MDR supporters. The MRND, which was at the heart of his problems, wanted to take advantage of an opportunity to recuperate that préfecture. There was a list of persons who had to be replaced. That was during the meeting of 17th April 1994, when the Butare and Kibungo préfets were replaced. It did not succeed. That préfet continued to be préfet of Gitarama, but people were accusing him of belonging to the MDR wing that was pro-RPF, and those people were saying that he had to go. </p>

To your mind, to the best of your knowledge, was the préfet of Gitarama, who had requested assistance from the interim government, was he assisted in the way he had expected?

            <p>It would be difficult for me to say yes or no. There was no evaluation or assessment in the field of what happened before or after that directive was published. The fact remains, when that directive came out, and when the missions were sent out to the préfectures, the massacres diminished. I'll give you an example. When we were in Kibuye, the bourgmestre of Mabanza, when he returned, he had the instructions, he held meetings with the population, and it seems that after that the results were good. This is Bagilishema. I read that information in the documents from the Tribunal. And according to what he says and what happened in his commune, it worked. There was a positive result. </p>

            <p>So what was the use of issuing a document for classification at the end of the month of April when most of the massacres had occurred within the first two weeks of April? What was the point of doing that, to your mind?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Counsel, I'll answer that in the following manner. The prime minister had promised that document on the 11th of April. That document was supposed to be published that day. That is when he promised to do so. Why did it come out two weeks later? It's because Kambanda had to explain -- his office and himself had to develop and sign that document. So, that tardiness should be explained by the person who was to sign and develop that document. That is the only explanation that I can give you, Counsel.</p>

            <p>I am not a native of Gikongoro. However, the government had planned the missions trying to assign people to different areas, and I was assigned. That is all. I wasn't the only one. There were other people, natives of other préfectures. One was from Ruhengeri. That is how it was done. We were told, "You will be going to such and such a place with such and such a team. You will be going to Kibuye. You will go to Gikongoro, et cetera." We had no choice. People didn't have a choice as to where they would go on those missions.</p>

            <p>No, idea. When I read it, you'll probably find it. The paragraph starts at the beginning I told you. On the French, you should be, at least, on page 4. Start from there. You've seen it. See the paragraph that starts "At the beginning I told you..." Do you see that, sir? I don't have a French copy, so I couldn't help you, but I'll read the part that I'm interest in to use, sir, if you listen carefully. This is a speech attributed to the prime minister who was, at the time, your boss and it says as follows: "Today, if you are an Inkotanyi, you must understand that you'll be considered an enemy of this country and of the Rwandan people. You must know that we will fight you. You must take precaution. You should pack up and join the other Inkotanyi while there is still time, otherwise you must mend your ways. That should be made clear. Let it be known that unless the RPF joins the government, we cannot work for them in the administration or at the cellule or secteur level. We shall not work for them at the lowest or highest level of government."Now, let's pause there for a while, sir. Now, what, to your mind, would this message have conveyed to the audience, the people who were seated, people like yourself?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, I don't know. I cannot talk about what others understood. But as I understand the message, the prime minister is talking to people to impress upon them that if they belonged to the RPF, they had no place, and the administration of the country, the running of the country, because the RPF must first of all join the government or -- the RPF must join the government in order to be able to nominate anybody. At a time when RPF was fighting the government this person is saying, "Look if you support the RPF, you will have no place. You cannot have any place in the government." He is talking to people, trying to impress that upon them. It was a fact that the RPF was not yet in the government, and that it was not possible for one to work for an organisation that was not a member of the government.</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>I said that one of the objectives of the government was to negotiate with the RPF in order to -- in an endeavour to restore peace. This is what I said. The first actual negotiations were concerned -- I know that such negotiations did take place. The government did send emissaries to the RPF in a drive to bring the latter. How do I explain this? Now, so that -- in April, certain persons, certain soldiers were sent out to talk to the RPF leaders at the CNT in a bid to negotiate for peace. Colonel Gatsinzi was a member of a delegation sent out by the government. And I do know that he reported back to the government as to what he was able to garner from the meeting with the RPF so that there was a contact between the government and the RPF when the government was in Gitarama, sir.</p>

            <p>Then he goes on to say on the other page, halfway through, "Préfets, bourgmestres and conseillers who have resolved to work for the RPF must wait for us to share power before they join their ranks." Now, at that moment, it is it not the case, sir, that the RPF was not in Rwanda? At least, not in Kibuye and therefore not joined the ranks of the government.

It was subsequent messages such as these, because they were people who when they misunderstood the message, blamed other people. And that was why I had to take the floor to say, "Gentlemen, we must be careful." When you talk about the RPF and accomplices you must be very careful, because I know that that would have serious repercussions, especially on members of our party, sir.

Sir, on page 12 of Prosecution Exhibit 30, in English, page 11 and 12. The MDR representative takes the floor. A man called Donat Murego. And his message is a little bit clearer, isn't it, sir? Have you found it? Whilst you are looking for it, I'll read it to you. This is a message from the MDR supporters or members at that meeting where you were."Party members' who are silent should come out. They should make their stand clear and defend the people's interests or if they support the RPF, they still have time." However, he says something very important: "They should know that you reap what you sew. Therefore they should work."Now, this is another message that says "you're either with us, or you're against us", isn't it, sir? You're either with us or you're against us.

            <p>As I initially said to you, I am not sure whether this document is reflective of the reality as established there. I do not know when this document was prepared. This is the first time that this document is being tendered in a courtroom so that -- I cannot say that the contents of this document are complete and comprehensive. But the interpretation I would make of what you have just said concerning the statement of the MDR representative, is that it was well-known that within the MDR, there were blocks. Now, if Dr. Murego was talking to one of those groups in his party, he was entitled to it. But I believe that he was not talking to the PSD party, he was talking to the members of his party. He can tell them -- he can tell the members of his party what he wanted to tell them and what he had told them or tell them is binding only upon him and those that will give sustenance to this message. He did not represent anyone in that meeting apart from those of his party.</p>

            <p>On page 12 to 14 of the document Prosecution Exhibit 30, you are quoted there as having given a speech on behalf of the PSD party. Now, this was a speech, was it not Mr. Ndindabahizi, these were not remarks to queries raised by anyone. You gave a speech like everybody else had done: like Donat Murego had done; like Karamera had done; like Kayishema had done; like Kambanda had done.

            <p>I did say something, yes. I did say something subsequent to what Kambanda had just said, and then later you would see what one of the members of the MDR party -- you would see what his reaction would be in the part that is recorded of the speech. Look at Rwabukwizi's reaction following my own statement so that I reacted following Murego who said that there are no longer -- shall be accomplices within the Rwandan government. I had just returned the day before so that my speech was between two other speeches or two other statements and my speech was targeted at the protection of members of my party. And once again, I am saying, I am putting it to you that the rest of my speech, the rest of my speech reflects the unthinkable things that are attributed to me, unspeakable things indeed. I have to say that in our party there were accomplices. In their parties, there were many accomplices. This is what I said in Kibuye. Let us be clear so this is not a manipulation. But it's this document which has been produced so late. Mr. Prosecutor, when you amended my indictment, when you amended my indictment, was the Kibuye meeting mentioned? If you had this document in your possession, why didn't you spell it out so far as that particular meeting was concerned? When did you receive this document? I do not want an answer from you now. I do not have any right to question you here, but I protest because I've been given a document which was prepared beforehand, I don't know by whom, I don't know by where. I told you that I was with your people from 1996 to 1998. Were your people with this document when they came to ask me to work with them as an investigator in your service? They had the document -- did they have this document, because this is a serious document? The allegations are very serious. When did you get this document? How? </p>

            <p>One of the other objectives that came out from this meeting, sir, which has nothing to do with the PSD party, who would be glad to know, but what had to do with your position as the minister of finance attending that meeting, was the subject of the payment of salaries. In that regard on page 4 of Prosecution Exhibit 30, the préfecture Kayishema had listed 7 issues that he was facing difficulties with. Item number 7, and closely related to that were items number 5 and 6. So item numbers 5, 6, and 7 concerned you directly, did it not? And this was the issue of paying salaries and carrying on the activities of the government. Do you agree? Nothing now to do with the PSD, but more to do with your functions? Do you see item number 5, 6 and 7 there, sir?</p>

            <p>Now, also in Karamera's speech on page 8 of that, he had also, at the bottom of page 8, he had stated that the government had accepted to pay cellule leaders their wages, but then he says something very interesting on page 8: "The government had accepted to pay cellule leaders their wages, but these in turn had to double their efforts in carrying out their duties and ensuring security." So, we then see a link between your office, the ministry of finance, which is meant to provide funding to pay the salaries and the incentive for local authorities to kill Tutsis; do we not, sir?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>I do not see any linkage anywhere here between the payment of salaries and the killing of Tutsi. Firstly, it is not the minister of finance that pays out salaries, and secondly, I do know that no salaries were paid to members of the various cellules. Before that, after the inception of the cellules, those people were not paid. At the given time, they claimed salaries, but in 1994 I do not remember but I know that they were not paid. The payments I made out were two civil servants, and those people were not civil servants. We pay through the ministries, they found managers at the ministries, paid out the salaries, but I do not remember -- come across anything to do with the payment of salaries for cellule leaders. I did pay out salaries, but to civil servants, yes.</p>

            <p>On page 15 of that same document, the prime minister responds to Kayishema's request. And in relation to the requests that he made -- item number 5, 6 and 7 -- he says in paragraph 6, "There is indeed scarcity of equipment, but the finance minister should distribute evenly whatever is available in a way that Kibuye may get its share." He goes on about fuel and other things which I'm not interested. In paragraph 7, however, he talks about the salaries for civil servants in March which were available, but that the war had broken out and the papers had not reached the back, so civil servants were not paid, and there again you come in.Now, he then pleaded with people to be patient and there was hope that the matter was being worked upon and that civil servants would get their money soon. The minutes say as follows that in relation to this matter, he then turned to you, or you actually then showed the participants, rather, that the salaries for April would be paid and you required the heads of departments to inform the relevant authorities of staff who were still in the posts. Now, there is something very significant here, you see, because when we turn to your own interview, sir, top 4, page 4. Your interview of 30 November 1996, top 4, page 4, Prosecution Exhibit 25, you say there, second to the last paragraph in English. "After ensuring the safety of the funds, my first duty was to pay out staff salaries based on lists and then the release of operations funds for ministries." Now, sir, the payment of salaries to civil servants at this time was a necessary consequent to the <stage>(inaudible),</stage> wasn't it, sir? If you didn't pay your civil servants, they wouldn't support your government, would they?</p>

            <p>Well, I am telling you that we paid out civil servant salaries in March, in April, in May and in June, we paid out salaries. We did not pay out salaries for civil servants to come and support the government. We paid out the salaries of civil servants because they were entitled to their salaries. The government of the day had to pay the salaries of the civil servants, and this is what we did. We had no other purpose -- you think that we did have other purposes. You are saying that we stopped payment of salaries, and it doesn't mean that we were sentencing them to death simply because killings were going on in the country. We must punish our civil servants because of problems caused by others; is this what you're saying? </p>

If you look at the English -- I will read it out to you so you get a translation in French. Let's start from the page before, so it makes sense, the last line. "The administration is not there to kill people. It is there to protect the entire population regardless of ethnicity, religion or regional background, but enemies must be treated said as such, and must be fought like enemies, but that must be clear. People must stop playing hide and seek. They must stop receiving one another. That reminds me of a question that I was asked by the bourgmestre of Gishyita because I find that question disturbing" Kambanda says. "We must find evidence to show that those people -- what those people are doing in the forests so that measures can be taken in a timely fashion instead of saying every so often that 300 persons or 200 persons have been killed. That would tarnish our image in the eyes of the international community. We must avoid doing anything that requires us to justify ourselves vis-à-vis those foreigners by asking them to come and monitor how we protect our population. Rather, they will see for themselves. We will know for sure whether it is the ordinary members of the general public who are taking refuge there". Sir, this is your prime minister speaking at a meeting, a public meeting that you were at. And I put it to you that part of what you call participation was informing the population that it was time to change the way they did their business, wasn't it, sir? This is not the minutes, this is the transcript, your document, Defence Exhibit 17 <stage>(B).</stage></p>

            <p>Mr. President, Mr. President. I have an objection. If Counsel doesn't hear the Accused's response, he should just ask this question. Since this started, we have never stopped objecting the political background of this Accused. Can the Prosecutor move on to something else? Did he ask for a modification of the indictment? We've already dealt with these issues. Now, here, where we are -- we've been here for two and a half hours. The Prosecutor started his cross-examination. We still haven't begun to look at the facts. I don't want to make a general objection against the Prosecutor's questions, but I believe that the Prosecutor should have the courtesy to wait, at least, for the Accused's response. And if he's not satisfied with those responses, he should just deal with that. He's going somewhere where we have nowhere belonging. He must ask questions regarding the facts levied against the Accused and at least, the very minimum, give the Accused an opportunity to answer the questions that are put to him.</p>

            <p>Very well. I'll answer that question as follows: I'm seeing that Kambanda is answering a question put to him by bourgmestre Sikubwabo from Gishyita who spoke of 200 or 300 persons killed. Kambanda reacted by saying, "Listen, sir, you are saying that these are infiltrators that you killed. We believe that you must be prudent. People must not go and kill Tutsis who are taking refuge in the bush and then come and tell us that they were killing members of the RPF or infiltrators." That was the remark or response that he gave to Sikubwabo, that Kambanda gave to him. So he's asking people to be prudent, to not come and make up stories and lies when in fact they were committing real crimes. That is what I heard, that is all. The remarks he made to Sikubwabo who was bourgmestre of Gishyita and the member of the MDR party like Kambanda was saying, "Listen, be prudent. Don't tell us that these are infiltrators when, in fact, it's just ordinary Tutsis so that tomorrow, people come to tell us 'We've killed, we've killed Tutsis' while you're saying something entirely different." Those were the remarks he made and that is what I understood from them.</p>

Now we have found out that there are two of his immediate family who are self-confessed criminals. It has to have a bearing on the evidence in this case.</p>

            <p>Mr. Ndindabahizi, when asked why you had wanted to arrest Gatete, when he was not involved in the killing of Karegeya, that was a question to the witness by Honourable Khan. He answered as follows, and I regret I don't have the page number because it has gone off in the photocopy: "You know a minister has authority over the entire territory. No one can prevent him from doing what he wants to do. He was somebody who was defending the entire population. He was like a father to the entire population".

            <p>Just to make sure it is the same page. Now in response to questions from the Bench, Witness DN, told us how in May, there was a cleansing out operation and by cleansing out, he meant that a manhunt, he described it as a manhunt. People were being looked for, individuals were being searched for and he said one would know, for example, that such and a such an individual by name was not killed. So they were looking for them. It was a manhunt, he said. In May, houses were searched, and hiding places were also searched and went on to June until their departure to Zaire. Sir, isn't it the case that you played a major role in Gasharu cellule in the middle of May, towards the end of May in such a manhunt, especially in relation to Cyprien Karegeya?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Here, here you really surprise me, Prosecutor. I - - I believe that had I brought Karegeya's children here probably one may not have understood that what the Prosecutor is saying about Ndindabahizi concerning these events in Gasharu it is not true. Did -- Karegeya's children were contacted by you before you got me arrested. One of the children of Karegeya did say so here that the Prosecutor's services visited him and he told them exactly when you asked him. I told him exactly what I told the Court. Mr. President, Your Honour, Judge Khan who put some questions through the Prosecution's witness that she was talking about Gasharu, on several occasions, she asked, "Why did Ndindabahizi want to call - - to kill Karegeya whilst Karegeya was his cousin?" Your witness said Ndindabahizi wanted to recover Karegeya's fields to distribute them to his sons. But when Karegeya's people came here, they said it was thanks to my sister, thanks to my family that he survived and that even after 1994, he stayed at my house. He stayed at my house during that time. His sister stayed at my house during that time. It was my sister who was responsible for their marriage. Now you are telling us a story, you are saying that your Witness GX and the other witnesses came to tell stories are more credible than Karegeya, the more credible Karegeya's children did tell me that I was not responsible. I even brought the killers here, the killers of Karegeya here to the Court, and they pleaded guilty. And now what else do you want to tell this Court?</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Sir, let's come to our final area before we go home. You have testified that it's been said on your behalf that you were trapped. Do you recall your expert, Professor Lugan, from France telling us how trapped you were in this government from the 9th of April, sir? And then we asked that you be shown Prosecution Exhibit 24, which is a document that we used some time ago and I want you in particular to look at the identity of the people who fled Rwanda, 24 please, Prosecution Exhibit 24, just a little sheet of paper with names on it. I should have -- if you look at the bottom of that list, sir, the bottom of it, the few names, the last three names. We have Mr. Ruganira there, we have Faustin and Gasana. These were people in interesting positions in government who fled the country in April 1994. Why didn't you do as they did?</p>
          </sp>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>My answer is as follows: Now, these people did not leave the country. Faustin Munyenza, who was minister of interior was abroad at the time of the accident as it is called, of the presidential plane. He was abroad. He was in Dar-es- Salaam on mission with the president. He remained there. He didn't come back home so that he did not run away.Gasana, Anastase, as well, they are abroad at the time, that is on the 6th of April, they were abroad. They did come back. Now, Mr. Rugenera, the former minister of finance disappeared. He went to Mulindi at the headquarters of the RPF. But the first two, that is No. 2 and 3, these people were not in the country. Are you well informed? I don't think so.</p>

            <p>Sir, if go to Prosecution Exhibit 25, page 24 of the English, tab 2, whilst talking about your flight from Gitarama to Gisenyi in June 1994, tab 2, tab 2, page 24, and I think I am not going to read the French without you. Question 37, so in French, if you look at question 37, yes question 37 in the French. If I am not wrong, the question goes: "The government made transfers on the 2nd and 3rd June from Gitarama to Mayumbu in Gisenyi Préfecture, who took that decision? You reported to have answered, we entered the room 9:00, the message was sent on a piece of paper to Kambanda who read it and said, 'Gentlemen, those who are afraid can already leave, for the RPF is in Mayaramoze". We moved forward and got closer. There was panic, we stood up. Everybody was running. We needed to see how they fled. It was total chaos. We went towards Gisenyi panicky. I passed through Kibuye, the population fled." Is it your testimony, sir, that there came a stage on the 2nd or 3rd of June where Prime Minister Kamuhanda, actually asked those members of his cabinet who wanted to leave to do so?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>Well, Prosecutor, it was to leave Gitarama, not leave the government. We were told, Kambanda told us, "The RPF is in the vicinity of Kabuye. Now those that - - those that can do so, leave." It was not for the purpose of asking them to leave the government, it was to leave Gitarama that was almost taken. It was being attacked. It was at that time that the government went to Gisenyi.</p>

            <p>So you yourself left the country as you testified, for a period of a week. You were in Nairobi Kenya, you left the country through Goma and you returned. Why did you return, after all, there were several people as you have identified in Prosecution Exhibit 24 who were already abroad and chose not to return? Why did you return to Rwanda? </p>

            <p>When I went to Nairobi, I left my family at Uwizera's house in Gitarama, that is his préfecture, my family, that is my wife and our five children. They stayed in Gitarama. Gitarama is very near Murambi where the government was. So that's what you are trying to suggest to me is that I should have stayed in Nairobi and apply as a refugee and leave my children to die out there in the country. This is what it means, a member of a government who is abroad, who stays abroad, a member of the government, that is from a party that was unpopular, the leaders of that party were murdered because people thought that they were pro-PRF, I am in Nairobi and I stayed in Nairobi so that my children, my wife are abandoned and left to die. This is what you are suggesting? This is what Mr. Kapaya has tried to suggest when he was saying that I went to fetch them. Why did I go to fetch them? You want me to abandon my family, why should I leave my family to die? You are asking me the reason why?</p>

            <p>Sir, you remained a minister until the 1st of November 1994, long after the government fled into exile by your admission. Is it not true, sir, that several members of that government either fled following the government's move to Zaire or shortly thereafter? Is that not true and particularly true of Casmir Bizimungu and Gasper Ruhumulia spelt, R-U-H-U-M-U-L-I-A? Isn't it true, sir, that even after the government arrived in Zaire, there were several ministers that left that cabinet? You remained; did you not, sir?</p>

            <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
            <p>It is true I remained there in Goma and it is true, when I arrived in Goma, several members of government knew where they were going but others didn't know where to go, so they remained. Why did I stay in Goma? I had special duties. Money had been taken out and deposited in a Zairian bank in Goma and it was frozen. The population continued to believe that the minister of finance may unfreeze that money. He must deal with that situation. The civil servants who had not been paid continued to believe that the minister of defence should do something. On several occasions, I approached the Zairian authorities to find a remedy to that situation for a long time. I then left Goma to Bukavu and I continued to be in touch with the Zairian authorities up to the time I left. If you are the minister of finance, you always must try to deal with money problems. I am not talking about money because I took some, I did not want to leave, I wanted to help people. I wanted, I wanted that situation to be cleared up before my departure. The person who was minister of tourism or health, you talked about the minister of tourism, did he still have things to do in Goma? Was there Rwandan tourism in Goma?The minister of health, were there hospitals for him in Goma? Those who didn't have any problems left. I waited a bit and I never said this before, but there were people in the RPF who approached me and told me to come back to the country. The negotiations I had with them took some time. There were people in the RPF who wanted me to come back. And all of these made me remain a bit longer, but it is not far story about money. I wasn't considered as someone who was dishonest. I left after another minister was nominated.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Very well, sir, I have one final question or two or three final questions to you: I am having a document given to you. I want to ask you one or two questions in relation to this. My learned friends may not object but certainly if their objection cannot go to the admissibility of this document or indeed, the use of it as a matter of what the Chamber chooses to make of it in the deliberation. I have had handed to you the clear argument between the Office of the Prosecutor and the former prime minister of Rwanda Jean Kambanda. Also attached there is the judgment of this Tribunal and the judgment of the appeals court upholding the judgment at first instance, of court of first instance.There is only two questions that I need to ask you. If you look at the pre-agreement, sir, paragraph 27 of that pre-agreement, paragraph 27 of the pre-agreement. It is only in English and I want to read it to you. Jean Kambanda acknowledges that he was involved in the decision of the government to attribute to designated ministers préfectures to visit as part of the government security effort and in order to call on the civilian population to be vigilant in detecting the enemy and its accomplices.Now that is the visit that you made, sir, to Kibuye and to Gikongoro and as you say, other people made to other parts of Rwanda. Before you comment, let me also draw your attention to paragraph 29 of the same document. It is a matter that I asked you earlier on in your testimony. Jean Kambanda as prime minister, of course, acknowledges he issued the directive on the civil defence addressed to all préfets on the 25th of May, 1994. Jean Kambanda, of course, in his capacity as prime minister, further admitted that this directive encouraged and reinforced the Interahamwe who were committing massacres of the Tutsi civilian population in the préfectures, but what interestingly, Jean Kambanda acknowledges, is that by this directive, the government assumes the responsibility for the actions for the Interahamwe. Sir, this is confession of the prime minister of Rwanda, a man who under Article 35 of the constitution of Rwanda that I read to you earlier as contained in Prosecution Exhibit 2, was tasked with directing people like yourselves and their respective ministries. He says, sir, that the purpose of your pacification missions in Kibuye and Gikongoro was to encourage people to kill Tutsis; is that not the case, sir?</p>

            <p>The contract the police signed between Kambanda and the Prosecutor has nothing to do with me. That's what I must tell you. The Kambanda trial has nothing to do with me. I have an indictment and I have to answer to the charges levelled against me in that indictment. Anything else that you want to try to introduce into my trial in these hearings, is not of interest to me. My answer to you, therefore, is, Kambanda is Kambanda and no one else; it has nothing to do with me, it has only to do with him.</p>

            <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
            <p>Thank you, sir. Now, finally, let me put the following to you, sir: So I put it to you that in 1991, you had political ambitions following the advent of multipartyism, that based on those ambitions, you resigned your position on the Rwandan civil service, joined the PSD party and was subsequently appointed as director in the ministry finance, chef de cabinet, or second-in-command, whatever you call him. I also put it to you that having held that second position in the ministry of finance, you aspired like every human being to greater heights. Politically, sir, you had no power having not been a member of the political bureau of your party. You represented that party at regional level only, sir. But an opportunity presented itself to you, sir. On the 7th of April 1994, through no fault of your own, the president is killed and you, and then an opportunity to realise the political ambition and aspire to greater things politically and you grabbed it. You grabbed the opportunity, sir, you agreed to join the interim government on the 8th of April 1994, with the full knowledge of those who are composed and were part of that government. I put it to you also, sir, that you had a choice, the choice was either to remain and conform or to run away and you exercised that choice. You did exercise that choice voluntarily and you exercised it knowingly what the risks involved were. Is that not true, sir?</p>

            <p>I would be very brief in my response. I told this Chamber how I became a member of that government. I told this Chamber how I worked within that government. I told everything, I hid nothing and the Tribunal will assess that. If it finds that I took advantage of an opportunity to become minister, they would decide the consequences, but that is my answer to you, Counsel. I didn't ask for a closed session.

            <p>Your Honour, good evening, Your Honours. Having gone through the motion, we have found that there are two aspects to the statement of that witness. There is the aspect which deals with the -- his - - with matters which we consider to be entirely based on opinion and the witness was supposed to come and testify as a witness of fact. So being a layman, he cannot testify to matters which are entirely within the domain of experts. So the greater part of the testimony from pages 5 to around 20 is based on speculation, is based on opinion on matters which are subject to various interpretations. We have had various -- of the history of Rwanda from various leanings depending on the background of each person, who would say, talk about it. And then there is the second aspect which relates to the meeting to the introduction by that witness to the Accused either - - and the investigators of the Tribunal.In that aspect of the testimony of the witness statement which is from pages 21 to 26, the statement appears to attribute the arrest of the Accused person to the fact that he did not want to cooperate with the investigators and that is why they sort of framed him for the crimes for which he stands charged here. So we think that if anything, then the witness should be called to come and testify here under Rule 92 <stage>(B)</stage>
              <stage>(C)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. And that witness, if the Chamber thinks that there is fact or which may call the person testify on a specific aspect of this statement then it can act under those Rules. So in conclusion, Your Honours --</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>If the Chamber for some reason decides to rely on that aspect of the testimony, I mean on the aspect of the introduction of the accused person to -- because that is a factual evidence, you know, the witness saw these things and took part in them. So if the Chamber decides to rely on them, then the Prosecution requests that the witness be called to be cross-examined on the basis of that because those are matters which touch on his culpability actually in relation to the charges which are laid before, before him.</p>

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. President, I have understood, I have understood, the Prosecutor's position. But first is the question of procedure. This motion was filed on the 27th of October 2003, according to Rules 92 bis, it gives the prosecutor one week to response to that motion. It is time-bound. Consequently, the Prosecutor's respond is not, cannot be accepted. I can refer to the jurisprudence, the Kayishema and Ruzindana case in the appeals decision regarding time limits. These are fundamental under pending of the trial and they must be respected at any - - in any case at the Appeals Chamber. So first, there is the issue of procedure. Can the Prosecutor today object to the tendering of that document and the Defence says, "No, it certainly may not." According to what the Tribunal then decides, we can then decide if it is relevant and we looked at the faults or qualities and we can, at that point, see whether or not DX's statement can be tendered. But first, we must deal with the procedural issues, Mr. President, in our opinion.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>Did you address that issue in your motion, Mr. Kapaya, in your written response? Sorry, which are the words which Mr. Besnier is referring to Rule 92 bis <stage>(E)</stage> ?</p>

            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Your Honour, from our discussion yesterday, we understood that that issue is mute because it is quite apparent that the motion was not brought to the attention of the attorneys before the -- in the team and that you said that, Your Honour, you expected us to go through the motions that they be translated by one of us and that we file our response today. So we didn't address that issue - - motion in the motion because we thought it has been decided upon by implication, yesterday that we -- </p>

          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>No, no. Well, if you are implicating me in this, all I wanted you to do is do since you looked surprised when reference was made to this document, I asked you kindly to look into the matter and report back today and that is exactly what you have done. So nothing flows from what the Chamber has said.Now, let's now look at this. Did you actually receive this document in French? I leave aside whether it was found in French, it may well have been, but did the Prosecution's Office actually receive that motion on the date indicated by the Defence? That's the issue now.</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>

            <p>That's possible. Now, according the proof of service from the Registry, someone has signed out for the trial attorney in charge of the case as receiving this document on the 27th of October 2003, do you have a copy of this receipt here?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Our comment, Your Honour, is that it was not brought to the attention of Mr. Phillips or myself, and particularly in the language in which it was received. Actually, we went for it in the language section and found out that even the translation was just finished, it had just been finished. And actually, we took a draft, if you look at the English translation, it is in -- there are some handwritten marks in it , it is still being processed.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>But the signature on the document comes from someone in the Prosecution's team, is it, is that correct?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
            <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
            <p>Yeah, yeah, it is possible, Your Honour, because of told the Prosecutor is quite large and wide, you know, it was not brought to the people who are supposed to work on it as such.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>So, you are then arguing, I assume, that Rule 92 <stage>(E),</stage> even if there is no explicit wording in Rule 92 <stage>(B),</stage> it must be interpreted to the effect that the document has not been really given notice to the opposing party, that is the thinking now. Or are you saying that actually the Prosecution got this and the Prosecuting is the opposing party but because of some exceptional circumstances, the time limit cannot apply? What is your position?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-kapaya">

            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
            <p>Mr. President, this is not serious business. The Office of the Prosecutor is represented collectively among its collaborators, if we want judicial stability and certainty, we have to respect the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and all the provisions that are in them. I can remind you of the Appeals Chamber and the fundamental decision in Kayishema and Ruzindana, 1st of June 2001, 1st of June 2001, paragraph 46 of that decision, the Chamber, the Appeals Chamber says that the prescribed time limit must be respected and may be indispensable to the proper functioning of the Tribunal and then, the -- and it's mission to render justice. Anything outside of these Rules cannot be tolerated. The Appeals Chamber says that if a problem arises, any party can move the Chamber for an additional time. This was not respected and I think that we have to deal with the judicial consequences of what happened, given that the Prosecution did not respond in due time, it follows that this document should be accepted.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>All right. In view of the fact -- I had actually hoped that we would finish today, I had hoped that the cross-examination, the re-examination, questions from Judges, plus the status conference could finish today. That was my plan. And there is still some to go, but in view of this issue that has been brought up now and since we have not seen the Kayishema-Ruzindana decision, we have not read Mr. Kapaya's decision. I think it is a little bit difficult to close the case this evening without having rendered a decision based on the arguments on both sides. So we will probably then have to close this tomorrow.I think therefore, I would wish to re-hold the issue on this admissibility question on Rule 92 bis until we have read Mr. Kapaya's motion and reflected upon it in view of what both have said.What about re-examination, please?</p>

          <sp who="#mr-besnier">
            <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>

          </sp>
          <sp who="#mr-president">
            <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
            <p>The best - - thank you very much for that clarification. The best procedure now seems to be instead of having the Judges questions and then go into the 92 bis issue tomorrow in open session and then have the status conference. I think we could stop for tonight now, it is 6:00 and then the Judges may have a few questions tomorrow to you, Mr. Ndindabahizi at 2:00, a very short afternoon session, very, very short and we have to finish this week. And we will rule on the Rule 92 motion but the expectation is that tomorrow afternoon, will then be the end of the evidence in the present case and that we will then immediately go to a status conference to discuss the dates for the closing arguments. That will be the method to be followed and in some issues should not take more than one and half hours, I think tomorrow on Friday.So it is agreeable to the parties. We will then adjourn for tonight and we will see you again tomorrow afternoon at 2:00, Mr. Ndindabahizi.Yes, please, Mr. Marçais? Oh, you just -- thank you very much. </p>

          <p>My first question to you relates to a cabinet meeting. Your testimony was that there was a meeting every day except for those who were outside the country. My question is: How often did you attend these meetings? I mean, except for the period you were outside the country.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Well, I attended meetings. I had been attending meetings since the very beginning, that is from the time of the swearing in, that was on the 9th of April 1994; and the 10th, that is the next day; the 11th there must have been a meeting; and on the 12th, we left to go to Gitarama. And upon arrival at Gitarama, cabinet meetings continued almost every day. I do remember that we had a meeting even on the 14th; the 15th; the 16th, there was a very important meeting that we had; and on the 17th, as well, there was a meeting. After the end of the month of April, indeed, there were meetings frequently, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th. The 30th, we went to Gikongoro, and started May with a meeting at Kibuye; so that there were frequent meetings; and I did take part in almost all of them -- all of those meetings, because I did not leave Gitarama throughout the month of April. I left Gitarama at around the 11th of May to go to Nairobi. I came back at around the 20th. In other words, Your Honour, there were meetings almost every day, Your Honour.</p>

        <sp who="#judge-bossa">
          <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
          <p>Okay, and you would go to Gitaka once a year, as you stated. And did you leave your car at the Gitaka centre, every time you went there and walked up to your home?</p>

        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>That is correct, because the road ends at the Gitaka centre, and to get to my house there was no road, as such. I, therefore, had to proceed on foot. I went a little uphill for about 15 minutes. It's not very far, the hill, and my house was on the top of the hill, so that when one is at the top of the hill, one sees the people who are at the Gitaka commercial centre very easily. There is no obstacle for one's sight, Your Honour.</p>

          <speaker>JUDGE BOSSA:</speaker>
          <p>And you went to Gitaka in 1994, June, around 26th or thereabouts, according to your testimony, and you saw your sister, who told you about the children who were hiding in her place. Then you went to Gitaka centre, you were told about Gasharu <stage>(phonetic)</stage> and how he killed ten people. Did you enquire about your cousin Karegeya at any point during this visit?</p>

Because when I arrived there, I found people at the Gitaka commercial centre, we talked. And then I went up to the house to see my sister, who told me about the children she was hiding. And when I went back down hill, I still found people in Gitaka and they told me about Gasharu, he was pointed out to me, and I was also told about Karara. I was given information on what took place, including information regarding my cousin Karegeya yes, Your Honour.</p>

        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>In terms of activities, I was to ensure that the party functioned properly in the préfecture. In other words, I should be in the know as to what was happening in the various communes. The chairmen at communal level should be in touch with me, or I should be in touch with them, and sometimes convene meetings of those communal leaders, if necessary. And my duties were tantamount to coordinating the activities of the party in the region. At times, there were some communes that had no bourgmestre, as was the case for the Gishyita commune, and at another time, the Kivumu commune. When posts were vacant, that is the posts of the bourgmestre, it was my responsibility to organise elections for their replacement by a PSD candidate. Sometimes we failed. In Gishyita, that was the case. We were not able to have somebody in Kivumu. But these were some of the duties I was responsible for; in other words, try to win over people to our party, that they join us as members.</p>

          <p>And why did you go with Rafiki? Was it because he had closed his house and you had nowhere else to go, or was it because he asked you to accompany him to the meeting at the Ministry of Defence?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Yes. When Colonel Bagosora came, he talked to Rafiki. I was outside the compound. Now, Rafiki came inside the house and told me, in brief, what the Colonel had just told him. So that he said, "The Colonel just told me that there is a meeting of political parties at the Ministry of Defence and that there was no PSD representative there," so he wanted to invite me to represent the PSD at the Ministry of Defence meeting. He also stated, in his house "There was a person who was executive secretary of the party but for the préfecture of Kibuye called Ndindabahizi," and asked whether Ndindabahizi could go along with him. Now he told me that, "I asked whether you can come with me, and the Colonel didn't have any objections, and the Colonel said, "Well, there is no problem." "So you should please come with me," he said. So I went along with him. In my testimony I did say that immediately he closed his house down and we took the lady, who was expecting a child, we took the lady along and I had to leave his house because he had closed down the house. I think I said so in my testimony. The gist of the matter is that he asked me to go along with him, Your Honour.</p>

          <p>You say here that, "The massacres took place because of the attacks by the RPF and their refusal to negotiate with the new government with a view to stopping the war," I believe", and you go on to say, "I believe that if there had been dialogue, the government would have mobilised sufficient security personnel to effectively stop the massacres." So my question is: Are you saying that the government did not mobilise sufficiently to stop the massacres because the RPF refused to negotiate?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Here there is the answer, but I do not see the question that was put to me here. The question is not repeated here, but at one given time, I do remember that we were talking about the massacres, and I explained that there was a delegation of the government that had been to talk to the RPF to negotiate the cessation of hostilities, and that the RPF -- according to the explanations that were given to us by the emissary who went, the RPF were saying they were not in a position to put an end to the war for as long as the government did not resign. This is what was told us. So that we told them, "Look," they said, "we want to negotiate with the military but not with the government. If you, the soldiers, want to talk to us, come and talk to us and don't say you are here to represent the government." This is what I tried to explain. And so far as the possibility of stopping the massacres is concerned, I did say that the government soldiers were concentrating on war against the RPF, that they were mainly concerned about war with the RPF, so that it was not possible to have any soldiers coming into the hills, because most of the work was in the battlefield. This is what I did say: Most of the soldiers were in the battlefield. I was trying to say that if the RPF had wanted to work with us and the two sides were able to come to an agreement to desist from war, to desist from fighting, those soldiers, that is the RPF soldiers and the government soldiers, could have come together for the purpose of approaching the population, so that the disturbances would cease and calm would be restored. I believe it was 1976 and that was what I wanted to say, it was an opinion of mine that I was offering.</p>

          <p>We are now roughly back to Karegeya. By the time you went to Gitaka in June he had been killed with his two wives plus some of his children, and you almost arrested Gishayke <stage>(phonetic),</stage> you arrested Karara. I'm just wondering: Did you make any investigations regarding this matter? Because this was your relative, in addition to being a native of your native cellule.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>I did not arrest Gishayke, because he disappeared before he was arrested. I was able to arrest Karara and took him to the commune. I had entrusted that investigation to the bourgmestre, who was in charge of the commune, I had asked him to try and monitor the situation and ask Karara what happened. So that was what I did. So far as Gishyake was concerned -- as far as Gishyake was concerned, I was given information about what had happened. There was no more work to be done. People were killed, those people were killed, and those that were in charge were to offer the necessary explanations for the commune. I was not in Gitaka, Your Honour, to carry out any investigations. I did not even know what was happening there. I just passed by to see my sister, and when I saw what was happening, to allay her fears, I tried to arrest Karara, so that he would go and justify whatever he may have done. Because I thought I should ask the bourgmestre to monitor those developments, and I thought that my duty consisted in only that and that alone, because there was also a question of retribution. There were authorities in that prefecture, the préfet, the bourgmestre, there were advisors. So it was not the responsibility of the minister to carry out investigation. I did what I did in order to ensure that people are enlightened to the fact that they can't just kill and go scot free.</p>

          <p>Mr. Ndindabahizi, I have two short questions for you. My first question, from the evidence we got so far we observed that the Hutus during the war could be categorised into three; ones who were against the government policy and managed to flee the country; then there was those who stood against the government and were killed; and the third category was those Hutus who supported the internal government policy and chose to join the government. Would I not be justified to presume that you belong to the latter category, the third category?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, let me say, once again, that I did explain the manner in which I joined that government. I did not join the government because I made an option. There was no option. There was no option, that was what I said, so far as I was concerned -- I don't know about the others that are concerned -- but as far as I was concerned, it was not an option. It was not on the basis of an option that I joined the government. I did explain how I left my house on the 7th in the morning. I said how I went hiding at a neighbour's, even in the latrine behind the house. I have said how my wife spent the night on the road with a child on her back. I said how I was able to hide at Raffaki's and how Colonel Bagosora got there. I said how Rafiki asked me to go along with him and how we arrived at the Ministry of Defence. I have said that when we arrived, everything was over, the government had been set up and that we were faced with a fait accompli. We were asked to join the government. We had no choice. It was a war situation. The city had been surrounded. I didn't have any option. I didn't have anywhere to go. This is what I explained. So that the ministers that were abroad with the president, they were abroad; it was their luck, so to speak; and the others that were able to flee to join the RPF, it is probably because they were able to go towards the RPF. I was probably unlucky enough to have fallen upon the government. So it was not a matter of choice, so far as I'm concerned. I cannot belong to the category, the latter category you referred to, having opted to join the interim government.</p>

          <p>Your Honour, I don't believe that was what I said. I only said that in the beginning. The first soldiers who were attacking the population was the presidential guards. I left my house because of those attacks by presidential guard soldiers. They were attacking the neighbourhood, and the RPF battalion which was based at the parliament, they started to attack the population, as well, just like the presidential guards were in the morning. They started in the afternoon and at 2 o'clock, therefore, in the afternoon, I had to leave my first place of hiding because the RPF left its base. So the RPF was not the first to attack. It was the presidential guard soldiers who began attacking and the RPF soldiers reacted to those attacks, and that was in the afternoon. That is what I remember saying, Your Honour.</p>

I don't know how people were able to write these things, I don't know. I said on several occasions that I was working with ICTR investigators from '96 to '98. This interview took place in 1994. Where was this document? Could those people ask me to cooperate with them had I said such serious things? And lastly in 2003, the Prosecution changed its indictment which dealt with charges regarding the meeting of 3 May. The last thing that was struck from the indictment were charges levied against me relating to that meeting that was suppressed. Did they do so whilst they had this document in their hands? I don't know, but I have many issues, many problems with this document, Mr. President. It's not just one phrase or sentence, but it's the entire document.</p>

Now, I'm moving to another subject. Registry, do you have the binder containing the Prosecution witnesses? This one, you know, the big one. Is there an extra copy?

Now, let's start with a general question while we are waiting for my copy to come back. There have been Prosecution witnesses in this room, Mr. Ndindabahizi, and they have testified that they saw you there. You say, "I wasn't there. I wasn't in Kibuye except on a particular occasion and I certainly did not commit or participate in any massacres". That is a firm view you hold. Now, these witnesses have given a different story. And my question to you, generally, now is: why would these witnesses come before this Court and tell untrue allegations? Let's ask that general question first.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Mr. President, I divided the Prosecution witnesses into two categories. The Prosecution witnesses were ten in number. Four of them speak of Gasharu, four speak of Gitwa and Bisesero. Those four who speak of Bisesero and Gitwa, were witnesses CGV, CGN, CGY. Those are three of them: CGN, CGY, CGV. I would also add CGM to that same category. Those four say that they saw Ndindabahizi in Gitwa. When they were asked how they recognised Ndindabahizi, they said that Ndindabahizi worked at the TRAFIPRO store, that he managed it, the TRAFIPRO store, in Kibuye. Their assertions were all concording, as regards to my profession as a manager in Kibuye where apparently they saw me on several occasions where they would go to TRAFIPRO to buy or sell their goods; those four. Mr. President, I've demonstrated before the Chamber that I never worked in that store, that I was never manager in that store. But it's surprising to see four people to come before this Chamber and say that Ndindabahizi worked as the manager of that TRAFIPRO store. Who told them that when they were to testify here that they were going to say "Ndindabahizi was the manager of the TRAFIPRO store". They asserted that on several occasions. For those people, I don't know why they worked together to come here to lie as regards to my profession. Perhaps, they did see the manager of the TRAFIPRO store in Kibuye, but it was never me. But to tell you why they got together to come and tell stories before this Chamber, I have no idea why. As you heard in this Chamber, those people, most of the Prosecution witnesses, were recruited by one person called CGH. You heard before this Chamber, and that witness stated that CGH recruited CGE and CGX and CGB, and recruited CGF, who is his brother-in-law, and recruited CGY who is his brother -- because they have the same father, they are brothers. CGY told us here, in this room, that CGN is his friend, so these are family friends. They have family relations, in some cases, these witnesses. And since they were invited by one person -- perhaps one had reasons that I am not aware of -- CGH who hid at Karara's, I know him. I know his mother and father. These people are related. They came together to come before this Chamber to lie. There's also the Gasharu group of witnesses, the people who came to tell stories before this Chamber include CGX, CGE, his son, CGB and CGF. They are related. CGX is the mother of CGE. CGF is the brother-in-law of CGH, and CGH recruited them all. The Tribunal investigators, I believe, contracted out their work to CGH. What can I tell you though, Mr. President? I was very astonished, astonished indeed when Karegeya's children came here. The Prosecution investigators went to ask him how his father died, and they said that Ndindabahizi did not participate in his father's death. Karegeya's child should have been the Prosecutor's best witness -- was not brought before this Chamber. I had to bring him before this Chamber for the truth to bring out. **********. He's in charge of Gasharu cellule. The Prosecutor doesn't want to bring the victims, the children of Karegeya. Why does he avoid bringing the real person, the real victims of the event? But instead, they opt to bring someone given to them. What can I tell you, Mr. President? These people say that I studied with them. CGH says that we studied that the primary school together. But if you look closely at all his identification information, you will see that he was born in 1960. I was in sixth grade in 1964. At the time, he was only four years old, he was four and I was already leaving the primary school. So he's inventing things by saying that I was with him, but I don't know what to tell you, Mr. President. I don't know how these people were recruited, and I can't tell you why they did what they did, but it's very astonishing to me. Each time they were asked, "Why did Ndindabahizi kill his cousin?" Every time they said, "He wanted to get the fields back". I think the Prosecutor - "he wanted to get the fields back". I think the Prosecutor was going to react by saying, "If that's how it is, I was betrayed". When I brought the children here they said that they were saved, in my own house. They were in my own house, and they were even there for seven years. The Prosecutor should not have asked me questions about Karegeya's death in Gasharu. When these witnesses say when Ndindabahizi arrived all the Tutsis, no Hutu children, asked what they looked like. Defence witnesses, in their testimony -- you see that six of them, six Tutsi witnesses who are from Gasharu -- how could they have come to support me? They accuse me of killing one of their own, of Nors. Nors's daughter was here with the driver, with the person who killed him, they were here. Mr. President, I have no idea and I can't explain to you how these people agreed to put me in a bad spot, to try to imprison me.</p>

          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Well, my position on this issue is that I was accused of what happened at the Kibuye préfecture, what I did at the roadblocks, and in Gasharu and Gitwa. My indictment is very detailed because I was even shown certain dates and locations that I thought I should speak about and defend myself concerning the charges -- allegations against me. And I saw that the Prosecutor didn't want to talk about the indictment, he wanted to talk about something else, whereas, I had the duty to defend myself upon the basis of the indictment. Now, had the indictment had been -- that the indictment were to be changed -- it should be changed on the basis of the procedure. How can I defend myself against charges that are not brought against me? If not, I would have prepared myself accordingly.</p>

          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Now, but these are still questions that are floating in the air, and that's why you are asked these questions, so let me repeat it then: were massacres committed in Rwanda from around the 7th of April to about the middle of July.

          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>The massacres were committed, but I really removed from any <stage>(interpretation unintelligible)</stage> responsibility. I did not, in any shape, way or form, take part in those massacres. But everybody knows those massacres took place and that it was deplorable and should be deplored by one and all. But as far as my own responsibilities are concerned, the Prosecutor puts them in Kibuye, and it is about Kibuye that I should defend myself.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>So, it is your position that that were massacres against Tutsi during those 100 days and some moderate Hutu? Is that undisputed, in your view?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Mr. President, when one reveals what happened in that country, one cannot say that the massacres that took place were only targeting the Tutsi because there were many Hutu that were killed. The RPF -- <stage>(interpretation unintelligible).</stage> .. since the 6th of April in Jumba <stage>(phonetic),</stage> Kibungo, Kigali, in all those locations, even in Gitarama and Butare the RPF was there. I therefore do not know, and I cannot say, it was only the Tutsi that were targeted because the killers came from two ethnic groups: the Hutu killed; the Tutsi killed; the RPF killed; the government forces also killed. So that -- it was complete chaos, and we know that Tutsi were killed. Hutu were killed as well. This is my position.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Now, that is perfectly a legitimate position. Everyone killed, many killed, but is it correct that people were killed because they were Tutsi during those 100 days? Is that a correct statement, leaving aside that also other people were killed? Of course, we don't discuss that now. I just want your view on that particular element of the case, please.</p>

        <sp who="#emmanuel-ndindabahizi">
          <speaker>EMMANUEL NDINDABAHIZI:</speaker>
          <p>Yes, Mr. President, people were killed because they were Tutsi. First, the case of RPF; they killed because they were Hutu. It was the ethnic groups that confronted one another, some killing the others. Tutsi were killed -- they were killed because they were Tutsi. That is a regrettable fact and I cannot call it into question. Nobody can call that fact into question. One should not attempt to do so.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>You may now resume your seat.Now, there are some other issues. One is Mr. Phillips' Rule 46 motion versus Mr. Marçais, approximately four or five weeks ago. The Chamber has considered it, the motion is dismissed. A written ruling will be communicated very shortly. So that matter has been dealt with. More complicated is the Rule 92 bis motion which we decided to come back to today. Now, we'll have the chance to look into the matter, and I think we may need to ask some questions to both parties before we rule on that Rule 92 bis motion. So, Mr. Besnier, I wonder whether you could assist us a little bit with that motion? Maybe you would like to introduce it very briefly and in view of the Prosecution's arguments, which we have now acquainted ourselves with -- how you look at the matter in that perspective, because the Prosecution has submitted arguments which you didn't really address in your motion. Please do. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Indeed, Mr. President. I'm very grateful to you. Yes, we filed this motion on the basis of Rule 92 bis concerning the admission of a written testimony. That written testimony which was served to me by Witness DX is composed of several portions. The first portion could be described as the historical background. The witness who was in charge of RPF intelligence, tells us his opinions about the 1994 genocide and the preceding events. Another section is concerning the moral character, the moral standing of the Accused. And then the third section, which is also separate, is as regards to the contents between the Accused and an ICTR investigator from 1996. Now, these three distinct portions appear to me to be all of equal relevance and importance as far as this particular Ndindabahizi case is concerned. The historical background has been discussed by the experts, but more precisely, therefore, it is in a conformity with the provisions of Rule 92 bis <stage>(A)</stage>
            <stage>(a).</stage> These are the cumulative aspect. As far as the moral character of our case is concerned, as well, I believe it is admissible pursuant to 92 bis <stage>(A)</stage>
            <stage>(e),</stage> and the section deeming with conducts between Mr. Ndindabahizi and ICTR agents is also relevant because it deals with the context; that is to say pursuant to 92 bis <stage>(A)</stage>
            <stage>(b),</stage> and this element in itself is important and quite relevant for the Defence because, Mr. President, earlier on you raised a question, you put it to Mr. Ndindabahizi, and the question was: why, according to you, the witnesses of the Prosecution came to testify against you? Now, here we have an element of response which is basic as already been explained by Mr. Ndindabahizi during his testimony. He explains that DX confirmed that contacts had taken place and that there was manipulation of Mr. Ndindabahizi by the ICTR investigators; that was manipulation. It was subsequent to the failure of the discussions between Ndindabahizi and the ICTR investigators that finally an indictment was prepared. Now that is probably the only explanation. There must be other explanations that we will discuss later on, but at this particular point, we believe this testimony is indispensable as a document. As far as other points are concerned, we believe that it is important for us to talk about the moral standing of the Accused and the special circumstances in which he worked before and after the genocide. There's a final point of relevance in this document, Mr. President. It is the fact that the; that is the witness, Witness DX claims that Ndindabahizi may have been given a ministerial post -- could have been given a ministerial post after 1994 had he been in Rwanda, but you know Mr. President -- Your Honours, that most of our argument grounded on the fact that up to the year 2001 nobody -- the historians, we had the legal experts, the politicians -- nobody has called to question Ndindabahizi's activities during the genocide and that element is a corroboration of what we have just adduced. So that in a nut shell, my argument says that these elements are quite relevant, that they have capital importance and that they do, entirely with the provisions of Rule 92 bis. And I would add that they are pursuant to the conditions laid down by 92 bis <stage>(B)</stage> and I pray that this Court admits them. I thank you, Mr. President. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>But this statement which is of a size, of about 25 pages. It characterises Mr. Ndindabahizi as a moderate timid person. It states that it's very difficult that he would have been envisaged to participate in what he's accused of. It states, on page 15 of the English version, that "I have serious doubts that he was personally involved in the killings". Now, there may be other elements as well. Does this not bring this declaration in a doubtful relationship to Rule 92 bis? </p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Certain parts of this declaration, undoubtedly, the Court will make a ruling. But as far as the gist is concerned, the important aspect; that is character -- there are very positive appreciations here and Ndindabahizi could not, on the basis of his character, or on the basis of what the witnesses knew, could not have taken part in the massacres. That is part of his character, and must be taken into account by the Court. In light of the credibility of the witness, and the possibility or otherwise of his having taken part in which -- in events or activities that he's charged with. That element should also be taken into account, Mr. President.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>

          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>I do appreciate your concern, Mr. President. I would have liked to get that witness here before this Court. Unfortunately, that was not possible for practical reasons, for reasons pertaining to the activities of the witness which I shall not dwell upon. But we did everything we could to bring him, and in default of that we thought that it was indispensable that his testimony be heard. Of course, it is up to this Court to make a determination on the testimony considering what the witness said and considering also the fact that the Prosecutor cannot cross-examine. This is, of course, the responsibility of the Bench. </p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Let us now assume that this document falls inside the field of application of Rule 92 <stage>(bis).</stage> Then you have a document which is substantially in conformity with the provision. You filed it within the necessary deadlines and, according to you, the Prosecutor did not respond within the deadline provided by 92 <stage>(E).</stage> Now, on this procedural aspect, you kindly referred us to the Kayishema and Ruzindana decision of the 1st of June 2001, yesterday. And now we have that document in front of us, and it's useful reading. Now, paragraph 47 of that document, first of all, maybe there are distinctions to be made between that case, on the one hand, and the 92 bis <stage>(E)</stage> situation, as indicated by the Prosecutor on the other, because the situation was different there. It was the Prosecution that on two occasions decided not to send the documents, in spite of the deadlines fixed by the Appeals Chamber. Now, looking at paragraph 47, you will see that the third sentence there gives an opening-up. It is stated that the Prosecutor did not demonstrate good cause for any of these failures, good cause. So here is a popular loophole in relation to deadlines. The question could be raised whether the situation, as argued by the Prosecution, is not a good cause. It was slightly touched upon in one of my questions yesterday, but here it is more explicit. It is a clear reference by the Appeals Chamber. May I have your view on that, please. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Yes, Mr. President. Yes, Mr. President, I fully go along with you. It is correct that this ruling of the Appeals Chamber does not specifically cover the issue at hand. After all, at the time we were dealing with an appeal, a memorandum, here and the case is different. In spite of that, paragraph 46, the penultimate sentence refers to note No. 53. That note, 53, refers to several rulings in jurisprudence, not only concerning the appeal, but also concerning the general characteristics of time frame as far as criminal law is concerned. I believe that the Appeals Chamber in the Kayishema case wanted to make a ruling in a general fashion, a ruling applicable to all litigation, as far as time frames are concerned, to ensure that the procedure is stable within the Tribunal. This is number one.Now, if we take it, and I believe just as you, Mr. President, that the Prosecution should be able to justify the reasons for his being time-barred, and probably justification may bring the Court to on the make a contrary ruling -- but what are the reasons by the Prosecution yesterday? He admitted having received the documents. He admitted having received the document on time. He didn't give any explanations in default of -- because, however, did he not respond simply, because he said the document was in French. I do remember, Mr. President -- I do not have the decision here with me, but I do remember that a ruling of the first Trial Chamber, Trial Chamber I, had set aside a motion for time frame extension from the Prosecution, and I was told that the Prosecution should deal with information contained in documents, both in English and in French, so that because of the fact that the Prosecution is saying it couldn't respond to a motion because the document was in French, that is not a sufficient ground. It is not good cause to allow the Trial Chamber to extend the time frame. </p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, the issue here is that the provisions of Rule 92 bis clearly states that you, as a Trial Chamber, may admit this document so long as it goes to the proof of a matter, other than acts which concern the conduct of the Accused as charged in the indictment. Well, the fact here is that the entire indictment is being challenged. The essence of the statement which my learned friend seeks to admit in evidence, challenges the entire indictment. He says that that indictment was procured by fraud, at best. And that is a matter which certainly is falls out of the ambit of Rule 92 <stage>(bis),</stage> regardless of the fact that there are other channels to challenge an indictment before the Tribunal. But I leave that aside. But, in essence, if you look at the provisions of Rule 92 bis, if you are actually challenging the essence and the very legal basis of an indictment, and you are alleging that this indictment was procured by fraud, then it naturally falls outside the ambit of that Rule, in my respectful submission. Now, if you leave that aside and you look at the decision of the Appeals Chamber as out lined in paragraph 6, in the motion drafted by my learned colleague Wallace Kapaya, the Prosecutor vs. Galic, the ICTY case, it is stated by Mr. Kapaya that the Appeals Chamber interpreted the conduct, the phrase, the conduct, of the accused to encompass the state of mind, relevant state of mind, of the accused. Now, I note my learned friends, my learned colleague's submissions in his brief, but let's look at paragraph 7 of that brief. I'm putting aside the state of the accused, or the state of mind of the accused. But if you look at paragraph 71, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was a moderate and politically timid. Well, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was appointed minister under the PSD ticket because there was no one else to fill the post. Now, if you run through a lot of these submissions in the summary of this Witness DX's statement, it challenges the Prosecution's case in its very essence, because we all know that for every crime that we have to prove in this Tribunal, especially that of genocide, there is the actus reus, and of course there is the mens rea. And for the charge of genocide, the mens rea, the intent to destroy in whole or in part, is the very essence of that crime. Now, if you have a witness statement that then challenges the accused's state of mind at the time, you are essentially challenging a case as to whether or not he had the requisite mens rea. And in essence, then, the contents of that statement clearly fall outside the ambit of Rule 92 bis because it's charged in the indictment. The crime is charged, and the mens rea forms the very basis of the crime of genocide. Finally, as far as I am concerned, it's curious to observe that the Defence list of witnesses doesn't even contain any indication about Witness DX, not even to say that they had tried to procure his attendance in this court and had failed. At a minimum, the Defence owes it, out of courtesy to the Prosecution or indeed to the Bench, to say that at a practical level we have been trying to procure the attendance of a particular witness. For reasons best to him, he is unable to attend in anticipation of presenting this motion. Now, what we say in relation to good cause -- and Mr. Kapaya can carry on from here -- is that we don't say that we didn't respond to the motion because it was in French. Our submission was simply this. The proof of service of that motion shows that it wasn't received by either Mr. Kapaya or myself, and both of us form the trial team, in essence, until very recently when we were joined by younger colleagues. And the explanation for that is simple. The motion was received by the team's secretary. Knowing that neither Mr. Kapaya nor myself speaks French, she kept it in her office and sent it off for translation. The essence was not that we didn't respond because it was in French, but in essence it was not brought to our attention, and that is completely different. We can only respond to something that is brought to our attention.Now, being that neither Mr. Kapaya nor myself spoke French, she sent the document off for translation. She would only have brought it to my attention when the English translation arrived. Now, had I seen the document in French, I may have made a different judgment call. I may have said, "Have it translated," or, "Do this with it," but it was never brought to my attention. Neither was it brought to Mr. Kapaya's attention.I will leave Mr. Kapaya to answer the rest of your queries. I am grateful, Your Honour. </p>

          <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
          <p>Yes. Just a few remarks, Your Honour. In addition to the problem of notice with which Mr. Phillips has talked about, I think this Tribunal has discretion to say that substantive is done. So we urge the Tribunal to not to allow issues of procedural justice to override substantive justice. So for that reason, we request that the failure to respond in time not be considered as a serious matter not to consider our submissions. Now, the other issue relates to, as Mr. Besnier has said, to character. He says that the witness statement talks about the character of the accused. But before that is done, we think that's why we pray that the witness be called for cross-examination. We should be able to ask that witness the background, the basis, for which he left Rwanda. Why did he leave Rwanda? We understand what he was doing between January '94 to August '95, when he suddenly fled. Why? The Chamber should be in a position to know the circumstances that led him to leave Rwanda before he can speak about the character of other people. And again, as regards the contacts with other people, the witness alleges in that statement that he was blackmailed, that he was manhandled, and that kind of thing. So he implicates other people who were not before this Tribunal. He implicates several investigators of the Tribunal as to what transpired. So it's important, Your Honours, that if you think that you may wish to act on this statement, then the witness should be subpoenaed to come and testify here, at least for purposes of cross-examination. It is submitted that he cannot make -- he has refused to come. Why should he refuse to come? I think the Chamber has powers, under Rule 54, to summon, to subpoena a witness to come and testify. And I believe his security can be guaranteed. There is no problem about that. And, again, it is not the function of the Prosecution, but the Defence may have considered exploring the provisions of Rule 71. But they wish, for instance, to file a -- to ask for a deposition. And we could have prepared our questions, or somebody could have represented us in the place where this witness is staying, then we could put our questions there. Mr. Besnier could have put his questions there, and then we get a fair deal. So for those reasons, Your Honour, we request that the motion be dismissed, and if it is not dismissed, then we request that the witness be available for cross-examination by the Prosecution. Thank you, Your Honours. </p>

We, for one, have not had that luxury until fairly recently, when Miss Lauriston joined us, and that was in the month of October. So essentially, yes, there are two working languages.

I was a bit worried about the remark here, Mr. Besnier, because Mr. Phillips here pointed out, and he seems to be absolutely right, that Witness DX is not on the list of witnesses that we were provided with in this folder. So are you not under an obligation, first, to apply under Rule 73 ter to vary your witnesses? And you haven't done that.

Perhaps we would have had the time to ask the Court to hear the witness. But today, very last day of my case, I'm obligated to explain myself, and we had three weeks, and perhaps a month, to do so. Perhaps I could have done some things. Consequently, this is sad to see the Prosecutor explain, through his own interns or staff, that he wasn't able to respond.

On that same day, the 27th, the Registry handed that document -- served the document on both the Bench and the Prosecution.

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>We have taken a while to deliberate, and here follows the oral decision: This Chamber is seized with a motion for admission of a witness statement under Rule 92 bis. The motion relates to Witness DX, which has reported difficulties due to his state of health, safety and professional obligations to testify in Arusha and he finally refused to travel to testify. This motion was filed on the 27th of October. The Prosecution responded on the 27th of November, following a communication problem within the Prosecution and a need for translation. As well known the point of departure is of course that the evidence shall be given as oral testimony before the Court when it comes to witnesses, but there are exceptions and one of them of Rule 92 bis. According to that provision, the Chamber may admit in, whole or in part, the evidence of a witness in the form of a written statement in lieu of oral testimony which goes to proof of a matter other than the acts and conduct of the Accused as charged in the indictment. So the first question that the Chamber has to decide on is whether the statement offered by the Defence from Witness DX follows within the scope of Rule 92 bis. It is a considerable statement. It amounts to twenty-six pages in the English translations, and the Chamber has looked through it and in particular focused whether the evidence offered can be seen to go to the act and conduct of the Accused. The Chamber has found elements in this document which cause problems in relation to the admissibility under Rule 92 bis. Let me draw the attention of the parties to those sections we find particularly problematic. There is the reference on page 9, last paragraph, to Mr. Ndindabahizi being a moderate a bit timid politically timid person of a high profile, activist, et cetera. It is true that you could argue that this is character evidence which is something which is allowed under Rule 92 bis <stage>(E),</stage> but it could also well be argued that this goes to the heart of the case. So it is too easy say that this is only character evidence. Page 15 of the English version contains a large paragraph about the interim government and a statement that the government included people who were not extremists, how they should have behaved et cetera and then comes again a reference to Mr. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, where the witness states that he was politically too weak, very timid, fearful, and the witness has serious doubts that Mr. Ndindabahizi was personally involved in the killings. Thirdly, page 19 of the statement, there the witness says that, "Unless otherwise proven, I am convinced that he did not participate in any massacre," and then the witness starts discussing why Mr. Ndindabahizi did not denounce the massacres but at any rate he concludes that he is convinced that he was within the system like a hostage and "I am also convinced that he did not kill any person".Now, these paragraphs are of such a character that they do not fall under the admission procedure of 92 bis.Now, there are other parts of this document which points more to the background. The problem is that some of the elements also, if they do not go to the act and conduct of the Accused, still raise problems in relation to Rule 92 bis, and here I come to the second problematic issue after having first discussed whether there are elements in this statement which cannot be reconciled with 92 bis.The second issue which we are discussing now is the fact that the Trial Chamber may admit, in whole or in part the evidence of a witness in the form of a written statement. What the Chamber is referring to here, is that when exercising its discretion, this main Rule under 92 <stage>(A),</stage> it will take into account the need for cross-examination and we have noted in this document several matters which calls for cross-examination, such as page 7, when it is a matter of how the witness left Rwanda; at page 18 and 20, about Mr. Ndindabahizi's relationships to colleagues in various governments and also the parts concerning the legitimacy of the investigation by ICTR employees and the assertion that the Accused was subjected to some kind of blackmail. These are all elements where cross-examination would be feasible. There is still the possibility whether there are other parts of this document could be admitted but the -- and the Chamber has looked into that. But our conclusion is that having now singled out both those which only with difficulty or which clearly cannot be reconciled with 92 bis and then the second group where we do not think that it would be proper for us under the main rule to admit it without cross-examination, seeing all this in context with the rest of the statement, we find it difficult to select remaining portions because everything is intertwined. So it has been very difficult for us to split them into parts which we could admit. Therefore, under Rule 92 bis, we have reached the conclusion that we cannot accept this document. In view of the discussion between the parties concerning this witness's late appearance, we have seen that, in fact, it was rather late that the witness stated that he could not travel to Arusha and that the Defence quickly tabled a motion under Rule 92 bis. Our point now is that it is true, it is true that in the Defence's list of witnesses, Witness DX does not appear, but we do not hold this against the Defence because when the Defence filed its document with the registry concerning the witnesses, it intended to call, it was already clear to the Defence that this witness in this particular country could not call and therefore the only road open to the Defence apparently must have been the Rule 92 bis option. So we do not hold that against the Defence. With this conclusion, the question doesn't arise whether the Prosecution's response is timely under Rule 92 bis <stage>(E),</stage> and we do not have to decide that matter. So this is the decision of the Chamber. I don't think the significance of this decision one way or the other should be exaggerated, and the motion is then dismissed. Is there anything else to be said in the case? If there is not, we are now awaiting a sentence from the Defence counsel. Do you have an announcement to make, Mr. Besnier?</p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Good afternoon, Your Honours. Good afternoon to everyone in the court. Mr. Kapaya and I will be addressing Your Honours this afternoon in relation to the closing arguments.I will be dealing with some very brief remarks in relation to the law as it applies to the counts, the three counts in the indictment. I will then try, as best as possible, to discuss the factual allegations as adduced by Prosecution witnesses in line with the elements of the crimes and the general context in which the events occurred.My learned friend and brother, Mr. Kapaya, will deal with the responses -- our responses to the matters raised by the Defence in their brief including, but certainly not limited to, matters concerning the various counts in the indictment and the factual allegations contained therein.If I may start, Your Honours, the Defence do not dispute that genocide occurred in Rwanda between April, May, and June 1994. Indeed, I would represent to Your Honours that it will be extremely surprising if they did because then one would be tempted to ask, why are we all here? In that regard, Your Honours, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, the former minister of finance in the interim government in Rwanda in 1994, is charged in Count 1 of the indictment with the crime of genocide, for the killing and causing of serious bodily and mental harm to members of the Tutsi population with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Tutsi ethnic group.In order for the Prosecution to prove that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi committed the crime of genocide, the Prosecution must establish that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi killed and caused serious bodily and mental harm to members of the Tutsi population with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, that group, Tutsi ethnic group.Consequently, there are two elements to that crime of genocide. First is the objective element, which in common law we would refer to as the actus reus, requiring more -- one or more genocidal acts to be committed. Then the second is the subjective element requiring a particular mental state, which is the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part.In that regard, Your Honours, it is not disputed, at least not as far as I am aware, that Tutsis were killed at many, if not all, the locations that are charged in the present indictment. The issue in dispute as between the parties is whether or not the Accused participated in the said killings as outlined in the indictment.Certainly we will consider the extent and degree of his participation when we discuss the allegations in the indictment vis-à-vis our submissions in chapter 3 of our closing brief, but I need to address you on the specific requirement for genocide which is indeed unique to that crime. And in that regard, I represent to Your Honours that the special intent as required for the crime of genocide must require that the perpetrator intended the result charged.I would also represent to Your Honours that the intent of an accused person in this regard can be inferred from a certain number of presumptions of fact, and it is hardly never specifically pleaded in an indictment. To that end, I would also represent to Your Honours that it is possible for you to deduce the genocidal intent inherent in a particular act charged from the general context of the perpetration of all the culpable acts systematically directed against the same group, whether these acts were committed by the same offender or by others.There are other factors, Your Honours, that would indicate genocidal intent. These are the scale of the atrocities committed, their general nature, and the systematic targeting of victims on account of their membership of a particular group.To that end, Your Honours, our submissions in chapter 4 of our closing brief seeks to do just that. In what numbers 119 paragraphs, spread over 22 pages, the Prosecutor has painstakingly articulated the general context in which the Accused perpetrated the crimes alleged in the indictment.By the time we're finished with the presentation of our argument at the end of today, Your Honours would find that the contents of chapter 4 are indeed a lot more than mere speculation or assertions as my learned friend for the Defence has alleged in his brief. They are certainly not an unbridled exercise of intellectual speculation but, rather, the underlying context which form the basis for the many allegations in the indictment.Chapter 4, therefore, of our brief, therefore, provides you as Judges with sufficient evidence that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi possessed the requisite intent to commit genocide. The contents of that paragraph describe a pattern of purposeful action over a three-month period, and yes, it includes circumstantial evidence.A few words about the charge of crime against humanity, murder and extermination, in Counts 2 and 3. It is our case that there exists in this matter all the necessary elements to prove that crimes against humanity were committed by Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at Gitwa hill, Gasharu cellule and other areas in and around Kibuye préfecture between April and June 1994. In this regard, Your Honours, it is the Prosecution's case that the allegations outlined at paragraphs 20, 21, 25, 27, and 28 of the indictment were committed in the context of widespread and systematic attacks on Tutsi in Rwanda generally and, in particular, within Kibuye préfecture during the periods alleged in the indictment.It is also our case, Your Honours, that the attacks on Tutsi civilians were carried out in a systematic manner and as part of a prearranged, broader policy or plan instigated and directed by the central government and evidence of which consisted in the modus operandi set out in our pretrial brief.It is also the Prosecution's case, Your Honours, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi had knowledge that his conduct, as alleged in the paragraphs I outlined to you, formed part of that wider attack.It is the Prosecution's case that the evidence that has been adduced by witnesses, Prosecution witnesses, indicates that the attacks in Rwanda, and in particular, those in Kibuye, were directed and aimed at a civilian population. The evidence further adduced shows that most of the victims were indeed Tutsi civilians, and they consisted of ordinary peasant farmers and those seeking refuge from attacks. They included the elderly, woman, and children.Finally, it is our case, as far as crimes against humanity is concerned, that the attacks against Tutsi in Kibuye préfecture were carried out against Tutsi based on their ethnicity.A few words about the individual responsibility of Mr. Ndindabahizi as charged in the indictment and our position on the modes of participation. In relation to the offences outlined in the indictment, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is alleged to be individually responsible for the said crimes pursuant to Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute by either having planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation, and execution of the said crimes.I represent to Your Honours that despite the general characterisation of the Accused's conduct in the indictment, we have taken a view that for the most part, the appropriate legal characterisation of the Accused's conduct is that of instigation and aiding and abetting, and that is with the exception of one event at Gitwa hill between 17th and 20th April 1994.Having said that, the Trial Chamber is free to depart from a particular theory of liability advanced by the Prosecution under Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> if the mode of liability that the Trial Chamber deems correct has been included in the indictment and is within the confines of Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute.The Prosecutor further submits that the responsibility of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as charged under Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> of the Statute can only be direct. There is, therefore, in our view, no substantial difference as to his culpability under the diverse forms of participation envisaged by Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> as outlined above, but, rather, the degree of his participation in the alleged crimes may instead be considered by the Trial Chamber as a factor in determining the appropriate sentence following his conviction.In adopting the position that I've outlined to Your Honours, we would represent that the Accused suffers no prejudice as he has been put on sufficient notice through the Prosecutor's pleading of Article 6 <stage>(1)</stage> that any of the theories of direct responsibility could apply. Having represented to Your Honours that we have agreed on the appropriate legal characterisation as being one of instigation and aiding and abetting, for the most part, I will say a few words on the elements that Your Honours ought to be looking out for as you hear my summaries of the evidence of Prosecution witnesses adduced before this Court.The mode of participation, of instigation, and indeed aiding and abetting, are both forms of accomplice liability. In other words, they're forms of complicity. Instigation itself would only give rise to liability in circumstances where a person, though not directly participating in the crime of genocide, gave instruction to commit genocide through gifts, promises, threats, abuse of authority, and other ways and directly incited people to commit genocide. In essence, instigation is that the accused caused another person or other persons to commit a crime. In that regard, it need not be proved that the crime would not have been committed at all if the accused had not instigated it. That's not a requirement. It need only be proved that the instigation was a clear contributing factor to the commission of the crime.It is further submitted, Your Honours, that where the elements of the actus reus of the crime is performed by more than one person, it is in our view unnecessary to prove that the Accused instigated the conduct of all the persons that perpetrated the crime. It is, in our view, sufficient that the Accused instigated the conduct of only one of them.To be criminally liable for instigating a crime, we would represent to Your Honours that it is not necessary to prove that any of the persons executing a plan -- executing the plan had the requisite mens rea. In that regard, we would represent to Your Honours that a person can be criminally liable for instigating even though no one, no one is criminally liable in respect of its execution.As we discuss the factual allegations, Your Honours will understand how this will play out in reality. However, there must be a causal link and a causal connection between the instigation and the execution of the crime. In terms of the various forms that instigations can take, we would represent to Your Honours that instigation could take a simple form of a persuasion, for instance, by appealing to another person's patriotic duty or by appealing to the other person's personal or family loyalty to the instigator. Could be a promise, could be a reward.A few words about aiding and abetting. We would represent to Your Honours that to be guilty of participation under 6 <stage>(1)</stage> for aiding and abetting, the Accused -- we would have to show that the Accused by his conduct directly and substantially contributed to the commission of an offence by another person. Indeed, the mens rea of aiding and abetting is satisfied if we can show Your Honours that the Accused knew that his conduct would substantially contribute to the commission by another person of a crime, or at least that he was aware of the substantial likelihood that this would be an adequate consequence of his conduct.It then follows from the above, Your Honours, that a person can only be responsible for aiding and abetting when a crime is actually committed. So generally, to be liable for aiding and abetting, the conduct of the accused needs to materially assist, encourage, or support the perpetrator in the commission of the crime.Now, provided the assistance is direct and substantial, Your Honours, the degree to which it aided in the commission of the crime would only be relevant to sentencing and not to the culpability of the accused. In essence, there are two distinct concepts to aiding and abetting. Aiding meaning giving assistance and abetting involving facilitation. Another concept that we would like to explore is the concept of presence at the scene of a crime as a part of our discussions in aiding and abetting. Even though mere presence at the scene of a crime, Your Honours, is not per se sufficient to render an accused liable for aiding and abetting, presence during the commission of a crime can constitute abetting if it has an encouraging effect on the perpetrators or gives them moral support, psychological support, or has a significant legitimising or encouraging effect on the principals, in other words, those who are actually committing the offence. And this is so even though the accused takes no active part and provides no material assistance.Finally, Your Honours, aiding and abetting as a form of participation under 6 <stage>(1)</stage> does not require a preexisting plan or arrangement to engage in the criminal conduct in question. To be liable for aiding and abetting, the accused need not know precisely who the perpetrators of the crime will be or who the specific victims will be.Turning now to the factual allegations, Your Honours, in the indictment, I will start discussing the roadblocks and then go on to the other events. In that regard, Your Honours, there are four events concerning such roadblocks which have been specifically pleaded in support of the genocide charge at paragraphs 8 to 13 of the indictment and have also been pleaded at paragraphs 17 to 19 of our pretrial brief. </p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, yes.The four events concerning the roadblocks have been pleaded in those two documents, the indictment and in the pretrial brief, and we would represent that before you even start to appreciate the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses in this regard, you will first have to understand the context in which the Accused was present at the roadblock. In that regard, we would refer you to paragraph 74 of part 4 of the closing brief, and the Prosecution in that regard would represent to the Trial Chamber that all the criminal activities of the Accused, as adduced by our witnesses and alleged in the indictment, during the months of April, May, and June 1994, can be directly tied with many of the transitional government policies at the time.In considering the general issue concerning roadblocks, before you consider the evidence, the two issues arise for you as Judges to consider. The first is this: Consider what the use and general purpose of roadblocks were in 1994. What was the purpose and content of the civil defence programme? And in that regard, I would refer you again to paragraphs 38 to 43 and paragraph 53 of our pretrial brief. I would also refer Your Honours to the introductory page of Prosecution Exhibit P. 21A and B, that is Madam Des Forges expert report, and also at page 21 of Prosecution Exhibit P. 21A and B. In that regard, you will find that the expert relied on by the Prosecution in this case outlined in no small measure the various measures adopted by the interim government in executing the genocide.Then there's a third document and that is Prosecution Exhibit P. 49. That document, Your Honours, contains a plea agreement between Jean Kambanda and the office of the Prosecutor. It also includes the judgement and sentence of this Trial Chamber following his plea of guilty.In that document, Your Honours are specifically requested to refer to paragraphs 29, 30, 32, 36, 37, 38, and 39 of the plea agreement itself, and paragraphs 39 <stage>(ii),</stage>
            <stage>(iii),</stage>
            <stage>(v),</stage>
            <stage>(viii),</stage> and <stage>(xi)</stage> of the judgement. Finally, Your Honours, we would also refer you to paragraphs 74 and -- 74 to 78 of chapter 4 of our closing brief.A reading of all the references that I provided Your Honours with would give you a very clear indication of the context in which roadblocks were set up, the context in which such roadblocks were manned, and a general idea of the sort of activities that went on at such barriers during the time relevant to this indictment. Now, having read that as a background, Your Honours would then want to consider the specific allegations in this case that concern the Accused vis-à-vis the various roadblocks that he was seen at. In that regard, can I start off by discussing the events at Fayer in Kayenzi secteur in May 1994 and point out, first of all, to Your Honours regrettably that we -- there's an -- there's an error in our brief, and it's rightly pointed out by my learned friend for the Defence, that if you turn to page 10 at the beginning of the Prosecution's case, the first heading on page 10 in the English version in paragraph 1 above, that should actually have referred to Fayer roadblock in May, because the discussion of that is Witness CGK, and she certainly was not at Gituku or Gasharu roadblock, and we apologise for this error. Indeed, the discussion of the Gituku/Gasharu roadblock starts from paragraph 4 and the evidence of Witness CGB. So we have included the summary of CGK but have labelled it wrongly, and we apologise for that. Considering the events at the Fayer roadblock in Kayenzi secteur in May, the Prosecutor relies on the evidence of witness CGK in support of the factual allegations made in paragraphs 13 and 25 of the indictment. CGT was a Tutsi woman, and she testified to seeing the Accused at the roadblock at Fayer at the beginning of May 1994.There are some striking elements to her testimony, and they are as follows: She is close enough to the location where she sees the Accused. And I'll deal with identification issues later, but the striking elements are this, which runs through all the testimony of Prosecution witnesses: Witness saw two vehicles arrive at this location. She describes one as a black vehicle and the other as a green Daihatsu. She then sees the Accused and two other persons coming out of one of these vehicles or maybe both of them. She testifies to seeing machetes in the Daihatsu, which is following the vehicle she describes as a black one. And what does the Accused do? Well, the witness would have you believe and she testifies that she heard the Accused ask persons in charge of that roadblock if they had finished killing Tutsi, and that when they answered him that Tutsi women that had been married to Hutu men had been spared, the Accused gave the order to kill everyone. She then saw machetes in the Daihatsu being off-loaded and distributed amongst those who manned the roadblock. That's the essence of CGKs testimony.Identification issues: You will recall that CGK testified that she was five metres from the roadblock, approximately five metres from the Accused. Now, let me address that. Five metres is -- in our context might seem a bit bizarre, and indeed my learned friend for the Defence interrogated her at length over this.I will draw Your Honours' attention to the cultural and educational background of Witness CGK. Did she strike you as someone who knows what five metres was like? Had she ever been to school? Did she measure? Ten years after the fact, how does she come to about five metres? These are factors that we would urge Your Honours, and we have done so in chapter 1 of our closing brief, to consider when you consider the evidence of a lot of the Prosecution witnesses. She may well have been a witness of truth but may have been mistaken as to the length of the distance between herself and the Accused. What is important, however, is that Witness CGK testified that she had prior knowledge of the Accused. She had no problem identifying the Accused at all because she knew him before 1994. In fact, she testified that she used to see him in the 1990s when he used to visit his parents at Gitaka centre. That's her evidence. In terms of the Defence case, to my mind, no witnesses have been called by the Defence to challenge the evidence of Witness CGK. Rather, they have based their challenge on her credibility and the credibility of her testimony in view of the five metres' distance that she claimed was between herself and the Accused. I have dealt with the issues of the educational and cultural background of this witness and indeed many other witnesses. With respect to the individual criminal responsibility of the Accused in relation to this event, we say that it is the Prosecution's case that by conveying machetes in a Daihatsu vehicle or in any vehicle at all to the Fayer roadblock, by distributing the said machetes to attackers at the Fayer roadblock to use in killing Tutsis at the beginning of May 1994, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi directly and substantially contributed to the killing of Tutsi civilians at the Fayer roadblock and, therefore, incurs liability for having aided in the commission of the offences in Count 1 of the indictment.It is further submitted that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi knew, he had knowledge that by conveying machetes in a vehicle to the roadblock -- to the roadblock at Fayer, such conduct would materially assist the said attackers in the killing of Tutsis. You don't convey machetes in a vehicle at a roadblock and not expect that they will be used in killing Tutsis if you consider the general context of the events in Rwanda in early May.It is also the Prosecution's case that Ndindabahizi's presence amongst those manning Fayer roadblock before or during the evidence of Witness CGK in early May must have had a significant legitimising and encouraging effect on those persons, and he was aware that his presence as a minister of finance, or any minister at all in the interim government, was likely to have that effect. You don't arrive at a roadblock in early May 1994 in a chauffeur-driven government vehicle, challenge those at the roadblock, distribute machetes to them, and not expect it to have an effect on them. The elements of instigation do not require us to prove that he was present when those who he distributed machetes to used them. It is enough that he instigated those at the roadblock.We would further represent to Your Honours that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi incurs criminal responsibility for aiding in the execution of the crimes outlined in Count 1 of the indictment; and in relation to that, it is our case that whatever happened at Fayer roadblock after he distributed weapons there to Tutsis was done in the context of the widespread and systematic attack on Tutsi civilians.Ndindabahizi is also guilty of instigating those who were manning the roadblock by telling them, once he was told that Tutsi woman married to Hutu men had been spared, to kill everyone. That is tantamount to instigation. He does not -- we do not have to prove that he was there when those attackers went ahead and killed Tutsi. He instigated them in the knowledge that they were likely to react to his instigation.This has to be seen -- his conduct at Fayer again has to be seen in the context of his position as a minister in the government. He was recognised as such. He was a minister in the government, and in that regard, we would ask you to cross-reference the evidence of Witness CGK on Fayer to that of the expert again and Witness DN, which is a -- who is a Defence witness. And the particular paragraphs that we're interested in you considering goes back to chapter 4, paragraph 85 of chapter 4, 86 and 87 of chapter 4 of the closing brief.In that regard, Your Honours, Ndindabahizi's comments about the need to get rid of Tutsi women married to Tutsi <stage>(sic)</stage> men has to be seen in context because Madam Des Forges told us, Your Honours, that at some stage during the genocide, Tutsi women married to Hutu men had been spared. It's there in paragraph 85. I won't repeat it. She gives us the reason why they were spared.Then in paragraph 86 of our closing brief in chapter 4, she says the policy changed. The policy changed, and those who had not been killed were then hunted down. When did the policy change, Your Honour? Sometime around mid-May, she said, 1994. "Kill all of them regardless of age or gender"; that was her testimony.Interestingly enough, Witness DN, a Defence witness, corroborates our expert, and in response to a question from the Presiding Judge, he testified how in mid-May following the death of most Tutsis there was a manhunt and a cleaning-out operation where specific Tutsi were targeted, having escaped the killings as of that date.So again, we see the criminal activities of the Accused at Fayer in the context of the overall government policy at the time. </p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Your Honour, the -- I was going to address the issue as to timing. Many of the submissions that we would make, and we will come across this on several occasions in this case, our submissions simply are this: It is almost impossible for any human being ten years after the events to remember with any degree of specificity when an event occurred. The best we can hope for is that someone can situate it, a month, at the beginning or the end. Some people are better at recollecting more than others, but we would represent to Your Honours, and it is our case, that regardless of the fact that Witness CGK put this event at the beginning -- sorry, early May or beginning of May 1994, the activities of the Accused as outlined by her have to be seen in the context of the changing government policy at the time. I wouldn't go as far as representing to Your Honours that Witness CGK was mistaken as to the date, but I would only ask that you have an open mind, considering her educational background and considering that she didn't have a diary or a Filofax or any particular reason to note the particular date. She remembers the events, she remembers that it was in the month of May, and we would represent to Your Honours that that should suffice in relation to the matters we're dealing with here.Can I then go on to the second roadblock event which I want to talk about, and that is the Gaseke roadblock, again in the month of May. The Prosecutor relies on the evidence of Witness CGC in support of this factual allegation. And, actually, before I actually start talking about Gaseke, just to finish my submissions in relation to Witness CGK, I would represent to Your Honours that if you believe Witness CGK, if you believe her testimony in relation to what she heard and saw at Fayer, then you have to find that this Accused committed genocide by instigating and aiding and abetting those at Fayer roadblock at Kayenzi secteur in early May. On the basis of one event, on the basis of a single event in the indictment, one single paragraph, based on the evidence of a single witness, you can find this Accused guilty of genocide. There is no requirement in law for corroboration.Going to Gaseke roadblock and the evidence of Witness CGC: in support of the factual allegations that we have made in paragraphs 11 and 25 of the indictment, CGC has a better recollection than CGK in relation to dates, Your Honours will be pleased to find, and on the 20th of May he says at a roadblock at Gaseke, which is on the road from Kibuye to Kigali between Kayenzi, K-A-Y-E-N-Z-E <stage>(sic),</stage> and Ruragwe, R-U-R-A-G-W-E, Kayenzi and Ruragwe secteurs in Gitesi commune, this is where CGC says he saw the Accused. The Accused arrived in a white vehicle from the direction of Kibuye heading in the direction of Kigali. He saw three people aboard this vehicle but testified that only the chauffeur and Accused alighted from the vehicle at the roadblock.What did CGC see the Accused do at Gaseke roadblock on the 20th of May? He saw the Accused and the driver of that vehicle extract machetes from the vehicle, and he saw them distributed to those manning the roadblock. Now, CGC testified that he was certain that the machetes that had been extracted from that vehicle were meant for the killing of Tutsis, and he came to this conclusion because he testified that he had heard the Accused ask why Tutsis were being allowed to go through the roadblock without being killed, 20th May 1994. He then testified that he then saw the machetes being taken into a little structure below the road. There were 20 men at that roadblock. Of the 20, he identifies between five and six of them. Now, he puts the distribution of machetes in its proper context, Your Honours, and he says this: "Before the Accused came to the roadblock, there was only one person armed with a spear." Now, there's a clear causal link there between the machetes being distributed and the manning of the roadblock. There's only one man with a spear prior to the Accused's arrival. That's what CGC tells you, but then he says after the Accused left the roadblock, he saw that the machetes that were delivered had been distributed amongst all the attackers. He testified that he saw the Accused give money to those persons manning the roadblock. CGC also said that a number of Tutsis were killed at the roadblock after the Accused had passed there and mentions a man called Nors, says Nors was killed about five minutes after CGC himself left the roadblock.Now, what was CGC doing at the roadblock? He tells us. He was -- had been apprehended somewhere else. He had been taken to the roadblock, and whilst he was waiting for someone to pay a reward or some sort of bribe to secure his release, this incident happened. And I wouldn't go into the specifics of that.Let me deal with the circumstances of the identification because in cases of eyewitness testimony, one finds themselves having to home in on these issues. The circumstances of the identification I represent to Your Honours were extremely good. Like CGK, CGC was only two metres away from the Accused, two metres from where the Accused was standing, and he gives a plausible reason why that was the case. He has been captured. He was right there. CGC also had prior knowledge of the Accused, and he tells us why: some family relationship. The Accused in 1991 and 1992 would always come and see his sister in Gasharu. She wasn't feeling terribly well and would bring her medicines. Again, I don't want to go into this detail.Now, what would the Defence say in relation to CGC's testimony? They call Witness DC. Witness DC was called to challenge the Prosecution's case. An analysis of the evidence of Witness DC can be found on pages 84 to 87 of the Prosecutor's closing brief and particularly paragraphs 176 to 179.Now, to an extent, the Defence also rely on the evidence of Defence Witness DA, Delta Alpha, whose testimony would also be found at pages 107 to 110 of our closing brief, paragraphs 319 to 340; and they also rely on the evidence of Witness DB, Delta Bravo, whose evidence is summarized at pages 104 to 170 of the Prosecutor's closing brief and paragraphs 298 to 318 of the said brief.What does Witness DC have to say about this event? He says the following: Witness DC tells us that the Accused was not present at Gaseke roadblock because he was there. He said he went past the roadblock in May, at the end of May 1994, as he and other attackers returned from Kibuye town where they had been busy killing Tutsis. They had been to Gitwa hill. He hadn't seen the Accused at Gitwa hill, but we'll come to that later. But he says that he did not see the Accused at Gaseke because he was coming back from all the attacks in Kibuye at the end of May and he was present there and, therefore, did not see him.Now, we would represent to Your Honours that it is simply untrue that Witness DC was present at that roadblock. First of all, we have his confession. It's not in his confession. Secondly, he places himself at a roadblock in Gaseke at the end of May and says that he is returning from attacks that took place in Kibuye préfecture at Gitwa hill in Kibuye town, and we all know that those attacks took place in April. So what was Witness DC doing in Kibuye between the end of the attacks in April and the end of May? The Defence would have you believe that he was just waiting for the Accused to go past Gaseke roadblock. At paragraph 184 of our closing brief, we have outlined our reasoning in relation to Witness DC's testimony, and at paragraph 185 -- 184 to 188 we discuss it at length, but at paragraph 185, we outline there that, well, all the large-scale attacks in Kibuye préfecture had, in fact, occurred by the end of April. So, in essence, what was he doing in Kibuye? Now, putting the time frame aside and other matters that go with it, at paragraph 186 we talk about the contradiction of Witness DC in relation to this matter. DC tries to allude to the fact that he was present at that roadblock when Nors -- he was present at the roadblock when Nors was killed. So at 186 we say here that DC says that when he arrived at the Gaseke roadblock, he found that they had killed a white man at the roadblock. That's what he says. The reference is there, page 14, transcripts of 30th of October. In other words, he implied that the white man Nors had been killed prior to his arrival there. Then later in his testimony he changed his mind and said, well, in fact, he was waiting at the roadblock for the arrival of the white man and that, in fact, Nors had been killed in his presence, even though he took no part in this killing.What he now says was that when he arrived at the roadblock, those manning the roadblock said to him, "Wait, there's a white man that has gone past and we're sure he's coming back." So he testified that he waited for three hours and that after three hours, Nors drove back and the attack happened.But if you cross-reference the testimony of Witness DC to that of Nors's driver, DB, a man who claims he was the driver of Nors, you will see from paragraph 189 of our brief that we point out what the contradiction is there. The evidence of the driver was that there were -- there was a disparity of a few days between the time they made the outward journey and they made the inward journey. Witness DC would, however, have you believe that this was just a matter of hours. Now, if there were -- if there was a distance of days between the outward journey and the inward journey, how then did those who were manning the roadblock know to -- when to expect the return of Nors? There are many other issues that Witness DC has testified about, and in summary, we would represent to Your Honours that Witness DC is not a credible witness. In paragraph 198 we say that he's currently serving a term of life imprisonment, he said, and therefore, he stands to lose nothing by incriminating himself in crimes charged in the indictment even though he played no part in them.So if Witness DC's evidence, we say, does not challenge the evidence of CGC, then the Accused has to be liable for what happened at Gaseke roadblock. In that regard, we would represent to Your Honours that he, by conveying machetes in the white vehicle to Gaseke roadblock and distributing those machetes to those manning that roadblock to use in killing Tutsi civilians on 20th May 1994, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi directly and substantially contributed to the killing of Tutsis at Gaseke roadblock and, therefore, incurs liability for having aided in the commission of those offences as outlined in Count 1 of the indictment. He knew that by conveying machetes in a vehicle to the roadblock at Gaseke, such conduct would materially assist the attackers in the killing of Tutsi. We say his presence there had an encouraging effect on those at the roadblock because they knew he was a minister in the government, and he knew that his presence was likely to have that effect.We also say, Your Honours, that the events at Gaseke on the 20th of May 1994 was done in the context of widespread and systematic attack on Tutsi. Apart from aiding and abetting under 6 <stage>(1),</stage> we also would argue that he instigated those at Gaseke roadblock to kill Tutsi civilians by offering them monetary inducements. That's Witness CG's <stage>(sic)</stage> testimony. He offered them money. We say that that inducement -- by virtue of that inducement, he is guilty of instigating them to kill Tutsis.If you believe the evidence of Witness CGC, then you have to find the Accused guilty of genocide by having aided and abetted and instigated those manning Gaseke roadblock, between Kayenzi and Ruragwe secteurs of Gitesi commune, on his sole accounts. Even if it's just this event that you find -- you believe this witness on, he goes down for genocide.</p>

          <p>No. We would never argue that Nors was part of our case, Your Honour, but the act of instigation was not limited to Nors. Nors just happened to have passed by the roadblock.Therefore, if you believe CGC, the Accused has to be found guilty of genocide just on the basis of that event and nothing else.Third event, Nyabahanga bridge roadblock is in May. We rely on the evidence of Witness CGM in support of the factual allegations made at paragraph 12 and 25 of our indictment, and in that regard, Witness CGM, again a sole witness on this event, testified that at the end of May, he saw the Accused arrive at the Nyabahanga bridge roadblock. And I should spell that for the record. It's N-Y-A-B-A-H-A-N-G-A, Nyabahanga bridge roadblock. He arrived there in two vehicles. He describes the vehicles as a green Daihatsu, loaded with machetes, and a white car, which I probably imagine was a sedan, but he says a white car. He describes the green vehicle as that which was similar to those used by communal administrators and that it was of a Daihatsu make. So we now have two people telling us about this Daihatsu. He saw the Accused alight from one of these vehicles. What did the Accused do at the Nyabahanga bridge? Witness CGM identified those at the roadblock, and he mentions them in his evidence. I wouldn't go over them. One of them was Witness DR, Defence Witness DR. And the essence of Witness CGM's testimony is that he heard the Accused say to Witness DR that, and I quote, "As for Tutsi women married to Hutus, have you killed them? Kill them because otherwise they will poison you." That's what he heard. Now, he then puts it in context and says as far as he was concerned, the Accused came to Nyabahanga bridge at a time when practically everybody had been exterminated and that there were only Tutsi women who had married Tutsi men left. Again, we urge you to place it in the context of the general events in the country at the time.</p>

          <p>I'm grateful. So those are the instructions. There are only Tutsi women who had married Hutu men left. And then he testified that Tutsi women married to Hutu men had been protected and says pretty much the same thing that our expert says at paragraph 85, 86, and 87 of chapter 4. Now, he witnesses those at the roadblock, including Witness DR, off-loading machetes from the green Daihatsu vehicle, and the weapons are distributed. Again, consistent pattern of conduct. The same thing as Witness CGK and Witness CGC at the roadblock, pretty much the same sort of evidence. Identification: The witness -- the event happened in daylight. He had a clear view of the Accused, and he testified that he had known the Accused well before this event.How does the Defence challenge this? They rely on the evidence of Witness DR, the man himself who the witness says the weapons were distributed to. An analysis of his evidence can be found at paragraphs 249 to 266 of the Prosecutor's closing brief, pages 96 to 99 of the said brief.What does DR say? And I don't intend to spend terribly long on his testimony, other than to say that GL's testimony in relation to this event was such that he sought to corroborate the evidence of witness CGM in all material respects, but then sought to distance himself somewhat from some of the allegations. And what are the corroborating facts? He admits that he was at the Nyabahanga bridge, but he admits that he was -- but he claims that he was there at a different time. He says he was -- the roadblock was established at the end of May or early June. He gives a very interesting reason for why this roadblock was established, and I wouldn't go into that. It's at page -- it's at paragraph 250 of our brief. But he accepts that not only was he present manning that roadblock with others, that he had a grenade, which is exactly what Witness CGM says. He accepts that, but then he diminishes his role completely and says, "The purpose of this roadblock was not to intercept Tutsis, as Witness CGM says, but rather to intercept Hutu refugees on their way to Cyangugu and Kibuye fleeing from RPF soldiers." Without a doubt some of the -- one of the most bizarre explanations I've ever heard a witness give in this Tribunal.We would represent to Your Honours that those who were manning the roadblock at Nyabahanga were civilians. They were handed traditional weapons, and of course they were ill-equipped to intercept any RPF soldiers. Witness DR simply has just diminished his role so that he can contradict the evidence of Witness CGM. And I wouldn't say much else about his testimony because it's there in the brief.So what does that leave us with? If you believe Witness CGM, then you have to find that on the basis of this event at the end of May at the Nyabahanga bridge, the Accused was guilty of aiding and abetting by virtue of the conveying of machetes to that roadblock, and that he knew that by doing so he would materially assist the attackers, including DR. We would also argue and represent to Your Honours that just his mere presence at that roadblock had a legitimising and encouraging effect on people like Witness DR. He also instigated those manning the roadblock by urging them to kill Tutsi women married to Hutu men. Again, we draw your attention to the general context and to paragraphs 85, 86, and 87 of chapter 4 of our closing brief to understand why this was important. If you believe Witness CGM, then the Accused goes down for genocide based on this sole event on the sole testimony of CGM. There is no requirement for corroboration. That brings me to the fourth event and dealing with the testimony of four witnesses, and this is the Gitaka/Gasharu event. We rely on the evidence of four Prosecution witnesses in support of the allegations in paragraph 1 to 5, 8, 9, 10 for genocide, for the count of genocide, that's Count 1, and paragraphs 25, 27, and 28 for crimes against humanity, murder. What is our case in relation to this event? It is the Prosecution's case that the evidence of Witnesses CGB, Charlie Golf Bravo, CGX, CGF, CGE occurred on the same day. That is our case. It's not four different days. They're not talking about four different events. They're talking about the same event, occurred on the same day. It occurred at the same location, concerned the same victims and, without a doubt, involved the same perpetrators. That's the Prosecution's case. It's not two, three, four events. It's just one. One event, four witnesses.In other words, the evidence is that the Accused, during a visit to his native cellule at the end of May, instigated the killing of Tutsi civilians and, in particular, that of a man called Cyprien Karegeya and Helen Mukantabana. There are a maze of issues, a whole variety of issues in relation to the allegations surrounding this, and I wouldn't touch on them. I'll leave them to Mr. Kapaya as to what allegations are made in the indictments, what is contained in the witness statements, and so on and so forth. But he will deal with that. What I'm going to do is just outline simply what our case is on this site.CGB in the -- in that respect testified that at the end of May, she saw the Accused arrive -- or he saw the Accused, I don't know whether it was male or female, arrive in a white vehicle at the roadblock in Gasharu, around the roadblock, in and around that area. A white vehicle. Two people disembark from this vehicle, which included the Accused. The witness testified that the Accused, following his arrival at Gasharu -- which of course is his home cellule. That's where his parents and family are, so they know him very well. Identification is not an issue. A number of people came up to him and they spoke with him. They included a man called Joel Ndabukiye -- Ndabukiye is spelled N-D-A-B-U-K-I-Y-E -- and his son called Emmanuel. Another man called Karara and a man called Rukundakuvuga was present. Rukunda <stage>(sic)</stage> is spelled R-U-K-U-N-D-A-K-U-V-U-G-A, Rukundakuvuga. These are the people present at that location. Some were in a bar, but ultimately, they were -- they all gathered around the Accused at some stage and spoke with him. Time period, end of May. What did the Accused do at his home cellule that day? CGB testified that she heard the Accused say to Joel Ndabukiye and his son that he had just come from Kigali where all Tutsis had been killed. He then asked for Cyprien Karegeya and Mukantabana. He asked, "Are they still alive?" That sort of thing. They answered him that they were still alive, and he ordered Ndabukiye to kill Mukantabana and Karegeya, kill the two people who are the subject of crimes against humanity charge and the genocide charge. Now, CGB, apart from that, heard the Accused make certain promises to those he was speaking with, and it's very important what he says next. He promised Ndabukiye that he would make him the préfet. Ndabukiye's son was to become the bourgmestre. Then he said to them, "Now I'm leaving, but when I come back, I don't want to hear about Tutsi in our locality. Make sure you do everything, and I will appoint you to those positions as a way of rewarding you, to contribute to the progress of our locality and region." That's CGB's evidence. Now, CGB then testifies he then saw Karegeya being killed by Joel Ndabukiye and his son using a club, so that's the first person gone. In relation to the second person, he testifies or she testifies that he saw Rukunda, the witness saw Rukunda bring Mukantabana's body which had been dumped in a pit near a roadblock. So the first is actual killing of Karegeya. He sees that. That's what he says. The second is bringing the lady's body back, which he -- he says somebody else did.</p>

          <p>Mr. Phillips, does it make sense that this promise is being made that Ndabukiye will be préfet? The point is taken in relation to the other one who would become parliamentarian. But what's your comment on that, please.</p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>My most likely comment on that, Your Honour, is to say that I would not like to speculate on the witness's behalf. That would be my first comment, and really, that's as far as I can go, Your Honour. Whether or not it makes sense is actually very difficult for me to -- to comment on at this stage, but I mean -- without the witness being here, but that's his evidence.The -- to answer Your Honour's question in another way, we would represent to Your Honours that it's perhaps not the content of the -- of the promise or the reward, but the consistent pattern which various witnesses at various locations hear the Accused making promises or rewards. And as you will find out later, this is something that reoccurs and reoccurs and reoccurs. It's a consistent pattern of conduct. Why Ndabukiye would be made a préfet is really a matter to -- for Witness CGB.In relation to the timing of Karegeya's death, he says they were not killed at the same time and place. They were killed -- they were killed on the same day, approximately four days after the Accused was at the roadblock. He says -- let me take that again. He stated that, "Although Karegeya and Mukantabana were not killed at the same time and place, they were killed on the same day," and he puts that day at approximately four days after the Accused visited the roadblock. That's his evidence.He goes into very great detail as to the process that led to Mukantabana's death involving the man called Rukunda, Ndabukiye and his son, and how they gone to her residence. And I will represent to Your Honours that this evidence is very similar to that we've heard from other witnesses in this case, including Witness DL, and that has to go to the credibility of Witness CGB.Issues concerning identification: Witness CGB testified that he was 20 metres from where the Accused was and -- the Accused and others were and that he had observed the Accused for about 15 minutes. We would represent that that is not an unusually long distance to have observed what he observed. It is not an unusually long distance to have heard what he heard, and that 15 minutes is enough time for him to actually form an impression of the events that were going on and unfolding before his eyes. In any event, we would always add the caveat that 20 metres was just a mere approximation and, again, the cultural and educational background of these witnesses and, in any event, the length of time from 1994 to now all has to be taken into consideration, but that is his evidence. How did he identify the Accused? He realised when Karara and other people called up and asked people to come and greet the Accused, the occupants. He said the Accused was a minister who had come from Kigali and indicated that, you know, it would have been most unusual for people not to know that he was there. We would represent, Your Honours, that that is very good eyewitness evidence. Then we have Witness CGX, a very elderly Hutu lady. This was the lady who was so convinced about her identification of the Accused that she even volunteered to touch him in the courtroom. She testified that she saw the Accused more than four weeks after the death of the president. The Prosecution would argue that this could have been any time from early, mid, to end of May. We would represent that based on the evidence of the four witnesses that we are calling, since they're testifying on the same event, this event must have been at the end of May. The witness testified that --</p>

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>She said more than four weeks after the death of the president. That's her testimony, more than four weeks. That's what I have in my summary anyway. So she testified that there was a roadblock which was manned or mounted by Interahamwe located in a certain location in Gasharu cellule. She saw the Accused in the presence of Joel Ndabukiye and a man called Karara. There's no mention of his son here, but that's her evidence. She then goes on to say that there were people who were manning this roadblock, and she recognised Rukundakuvuga again and a man called Sendiragora. Sendiragora is spelled S-E-N-D-I-R-A-G-O-R-A. So those were the people she identified at the roadblock. What did she see the Accused do? She heard the Accused order Karara, Joel Ndabukiye and his son to kill Helen Mukantabana and Cyprien Karegeya. That's what she heard, and she tells us how she heard this. She further testified that she knew that Helen Mukantabana had died, although she could not tell who killed her. If you believe the evidence of this witness, we would represent to you here and now that it is not a requirement for -- to find him guilty by having instigated that she identifies who the perpetrator of the crime was. It's enough that she heard him instigate those who were present and that the witness died and that there's a causal link between the time frame when she heard these instructions and the time and location where the victim eventually died.Witness CGX testified that her son had been killed at the same roadblock and blames Rukundakuvuga for this. We've pointed out in our brief that that person has assumed responsibility for this crime, which goes -- which has to go to Witness CGX's credibility.What were the circumstances of identification? She was 500 centimetres, my notes say, standing at the roadblock. She was standing at an elevated area near the road to Kirambo when she saw the Accused. This elderly woman also testified that the Accused was her neighbour from her native village, and she was, therefore, very familiar with him. </p>

          <p>Very good circumstances of identification, we would say. She was Hutu, by the way, and that's very important. It means that she had freedom to roam around. She wasn't hiding.

          <speaker>MR. ADEOGUN-PHILLIPS:</speaker>
          <p>Yes, Your Honour. I use that word with great caution.We have another old witness, Witness CGF, who is an elderly Hutu man, and he also testifies that he was at the roadblock around towards the end of May, he says, and that's as best as he could put it. He gives the same physical attributes as to the location of the roadblock as Witness CGX, between X and X house; and he also testifies about the same people who were seen manning the roadblock, a man called Rukundakuvuga, seen killing the people at the roadblock. Whilst he was at the roadblock -- and he gives a reason why he was at the roadblock -- the Accused is seen arriving in a white vehicle accompanied by a driver and a soldier. What is striking about the evidence here is that most people tend to see the Accused with three people in his vehicle, and this is yet another witness that sees that.What did the Accused do when Witness CGF saw him on that day? He also testified that he heard the Accused ask Karara and Ndabukiye, same people, if Karegeya was dead. And when the response came that Karegeya was still alive, the Accused wondered why. He also inquired about the whereabouts of Mukantabana, the same lady as well, and Witness CGF says that he heard the Accused say to Ndabukiye that he knew or he was aware that this lady was hiding at Ndabukiye's house because she had paid Ndabukiye with some cows to guarantee her protection. In any event, CGF says that he heard the Accused order Ndabukiye to kill her all the same. We have quoted the words used by the Accused according to CGF, and I'm not going to repeat that. It's in our brief.The witness then says that he became aware Karegeya and Mukantabana, also known as Nyiramaritete, were eventually killed. Nyiramaritete is spelled N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-T-E-T-E <stage>(sic).</stage> Nyiramaritete was a nickname that Mukantabana was known by in the locality of Gasharu. Then, another thing: Apart from hearing the specific instructions concerning Mukantabana and Karegeya, Witness CGF also testified that he heard the Accused give the order to kill all Tutsi and get rewards by sharing the land and cattle of those who had killed -- who had been killed. So again we find a reoccurring issue of rewards being offered, rewards offered, cattle and positions and things like that.Identification: Witness CFG was an old man who was a Hutu. He was free to move around. He was not in hiding. He testified that there was hardly 8 metres between himself and the Accused, and quite rightly, too. He had no reason to be further away from him. Although he had not seen the Accused before -- now, this was his first sighting of the Accused, never seen the Accused before -- he testified that he was able to recognise the Accused because he had heard others refer to him as Ndindabahizi, which, again, is not unusual. Ndindabahizi at the time was a minister, and there were very few people in that locality who drove cars. So it is not unusual that he would have heard reference being made to him.In any event, Witness CGF was able to positively identify the man he had seen in 1994 in this courtroom, regardless of what representations the Defence have made as to the positioning of this courtroom.Final witness on this point is Witness CGE, a witness, I believe, who's Tutsi, hiding in a bush in late May. He saw the Accused at this roadblock at Gasharu, same location, between X and X house and Ndabukiye's house; pretty much consistent with all the others witnesses in relation to where this roadblock was situated. He testified that he noticed that Karara and Ndabukiye were controlling the roadblock and Rukundakuvuga and Sendiragora were also part of the group manning the roadblock. Again, he corroborates Witness CGF's evidence in that regard.The Accused arrived in a white car, also accompanied by a soldier and a driver. CGE saw Karara and Ndabukiye and other Interahamwe welcome the Accused. Consistent evidence again.What did CGE see the Accused do? He asked -- he testified, rather, that he heard the Accused ask Karegeya -- ask Ndabukiye whether Karegeya was dead. When he was answered that Karegeya was still alive, he asked why people were not doing their job. We would argue that that comment was instigation. He told people to kill Tutsi and so that Tutsi children in the future would ask what a Tutsi looks like. This is an appeal to the patriotism at the time. We would recommend -- we would argue that that is a form of instigation: Kill Tutsi so children in future would ask what a Tutsi looks like. He was talking to Hutus.Now, the witness testified that he heard the Accused tell people that after they'd killed the Tutsis, they would share their land. Now, again, another bit of evidence that is consistent with that of Witness CGF: rewards being offered. Being a resident of Gasharu, the witness testified he was aware that Ndabukiye and another man called Seyeze, S-E-Y-E-Z-Z-E <stage>(sic),</stage> were rewarded with land of people who had been killed.Now, in relation to the killing of -- or the death of Karegeya and Mukantabana, the witness testifies that Karegeya was killed after the Accused had departed. He confirms that Mukantabana had sought refuge at Joel Ndabukiye's house, and also confirms that the lady was killed around the same period of Karegeya, but he did not know who killed them.Now, he also talks about Tutsis generally being killed at the roadblock in Gasharu after -- before and after the Accused had visited that locality.Going to the identification of -- the evidence of identification supporting the evidence of Witness CGE, he was approximately 8 metres away hiding in a bush when he saw the Accused at Gasharu. However, he testified that he was well acquainted with the Accused as both of them hail from Gasharu in Gitesi commune.Now, when we look at the evidence of all four witnesses that I've just gone through, with the exception of CGX, all witnesses place these events at the end of May. Those who indicate dates that are different from -- sorry, those who indicate dates during the oral testimony that are different from their written testimony have given reasons why they did so, and I have no reason to doubt it 'cause I wasn't there.Now, many witnesses support -- many Defence witnesses support the Prosecution's case and claim that the Accused visited Gasharu towards the end of May, although some of them put it at the very beginning of June. So even their own witnesses are saying, well, the end of May, possibly beginning of June. Such a witness is Witness DJ. She says end of May, beginning of June; paragraph 32 of chapter 5 of our closing brief. Witness DL, another Defence witness, end of May, beginning of June; paragraph 118 of chapter 5. DI, beginning of June; paragraph 94. DH, early June; paragraph 56. And they go on like that.It's the Defence case that the Accused did not visit Gasharu until the end of June, and in that regard, the Accused himself testified that he only visited Gasharu at the end of June. He is supported, I might add, in relation to that by Witness DM, Delta Mother, who says he visited at the end of June. See paragraph 103, chapter 4 -- sorry, chapter 5, not chapter 4. One-oh-three, chapter 5. And Witness DU also seems to suggest that the Accused visited at the end of June.If you accept that the Accused visited at the end of June then, in essence, he contradicts about seven of his own witnesses who are native to Gasharu, which is something. Seven of his own witnesses and relatives who are native to Gasharu, he actually contradicts their evidence because they actually say that he came at end of May, at the very, very beginning of June. But then again, these are dates that give or take a few weeks here and there.Apart from the location of the -- the date of the event, the Defence challenge that Karegeya and Mukantabana were actually killed in May. They argue that they were killed in April and not May, but even that fact is contradicted by their own witnesses. They can't even agree amongst themselves as to when Karegeya and Mukantabana were killed. So they can't agree on when the Accused visited, and then they can't even agree on when these two people were killed, and I'll tell you why in due course.In relation to their defence on this matter, the Defence rely on the evidence of detained Witness DO, and his evidence can be found on pages 91 to 96 of our closing brief, all in English of course, and paragraph 223 and 248 of our closing brief; and another detained witness, Witness DM, whose evidence can be found on pages 88 to 91 of our closing brief, and paragraphs 200 to 222 of the same brief. Those are the witnesses that they rely on in relation to, to the killing, and the reason why they do is that Witness DO tends to accept responsibility for killing Mukantabana. Witness DM, the Defence tell us, killed Karegeya, even though Witness DM seems to diminish his responsibility in that regard.Now, apart from these two witnesses, we have the Gasharu witnesses, the witnesses that were native to that locality. Most of their evidence, I might add, is based on hearsay, but I'll outline who they are anyway: Witness DJ, Witness DH, Witness DI, Witness DL, Witness DU, and Witness DV. Collectively, an analysis of their evidence can be found at paragraphs 32 to 167 of our closing brief, on pages 58 to 82. So paragraphs 32 to 167 collectively deals with all these six witnesses that I have alluded to, on pages 58 to 82 of our brief.In essence, what these six people have told us, and they're all native to that locality, is that these two people were -- first of all, they were killed before the Accused even visited Gasharu. So, you know, the two of them had been killed. It had nothing to do with his instructions or his instigation, whatever. So they'd been killed before; they were killed in April. Secondly, they were killed for reasons other than being Tutsi. In fact, one of their witnesses said that Mukantabana had been killed because she poisoned somebody in 1985. So they had other reasons for killing them. It had nothing to do with the prevailing events at the time, but that in any event, these witnesses were not killed -- these victims, Ndabukiye and Mukantabana, were not killed by Joel Ntabukiye and his son; rather, they were killed by Witness DO and Witness DM; finally, that Witness DO and Witness DM did not receive instructions from the Accused to kill these people. So that's essentially the way they fall back on the Prosecution's case, and we would go through it, in essence, to show you that they don't actually have a defence in that regard.Now, the evidence -- talking about Witness DM, Witness DM, according to the Defence, is the sole eyewitness to the killing of Cyprien Karegeya. They say that he, he killed the guy. He killed him himself. And even Witness DI and Witness DH, who are in a position to know who killed Karegeya, actually tell us that Witness DM did it. Witness DL tells us Witness DM did it. They tell us that Witness DM confessed. Not only did they see him do it, he actually has confessed to doing it, so one would expect that once Witness DM comes into the witness box, he's going to assume responsibility for killing Cyprien Karegeya. Lo and behold, that was not to be the case. In that regard, Witness DM claimed that he was present during the attack on Karegeya, but he denied killing him. He actually, at the end of his testimony, reduced himself to a mere observer. Now, because something cannot be white and blue at the same time, there has to be an explanation, and the explanation has to be this: Witness DM, at some stage, must have indicated that he was willing to assume responsibility for Karegeya's death. At some stage between the time he came to this courtroom he changed his mind, and slowly throughout his testimony he diminished his responsibility, and in the end he said as follows, and I've written this at paragraph 216 of our closing brief, page 90: "I consider myself an observer. I was not with them in the beginning. We met along the way somewhere, and I joined the group. We did not discuss the plan together." Now, this is the evidence of a man that the Defence tells us killed Cyprien Karegeya. Well, it goes without saying that Witness DM does not accept any liability for it. Therefore, any other witness that tells you that Witness DM did it is not credible because the man himself says, "I didn't do it. I didn't do it." In any event, Witness DM himself places this event at the end of April. That's for the timing.Now, Witness DO, who presumably would also know about this event, says that Cyprien Karegeya was killed seven or so days after the killing of Mukantabana, which according to him took place at the beginning of May. So we have a situation whereby the man who the Defence say killed Mukantabana doesn't say it's in April. He actually says, "I did this in May." And if you look at his confession statement, it supports that allegation that he did it in May. So in terms of the timing, Witness DO doesn't really help us, either.Now, Witness DV is not an eyewitness -- was not an eyewitness to the killing of Karegeya but says that he heard that he was killed at the beginning of May 1994. Witness DL: Now, Witness DL is important because Witness DI relied on Witness DL to make her submissions before you in this courtroom. So Witness DL himself turns out not to be an eyewitness to the killing of Karegeya, but he felt that Witness DM was responsible because he saw Witness DM taking him away in mid-April 1994, but Witness DM denies that. Witness DM says, "Oh, I met them along the way as they were going somewhere." So, Witness DL is not credible.Then you have Witness DI who, presumably for reasons known to all of us, should know how this man died. She says, "Well, I base my information on the evidence of Witness DL. Witness DL told me that DM killed you -- killed Karegeya." But Witness DM denies this.So, then we have Witness DH. Witness DH, who also should be in a position to know who killed Karegeya for reasons known to all of us, says that he relied on information from Witness DL. Well, Witness DL blames Witness DM, and Witness DM says, "I didn't do it." So where does that leave us? Finally, Witness DG says, "It was reported to me that Witness DM and two others killed Cyprien Karegeya in the month of May 1994." Well, again, hearsay evidence which is neither here nor there.So, what you basically have is a situation whereby the Defence did not effectively challenge the Prosecution's case on the killing of either Karegeya or Mukantabana. They can't actually make up their mind what happened, and they claim to know. Our evidence is based on Witness CGB. CGB says, "I actually saw X and X going to kill Karegeya, and I saw them coming back with the body of Mukantabana." If you believe CGB, then you convict him <stage>(sic)</stage> for the killing of these two people.Witness CGB's evidence is particularly damaging because she claims -- or he claims to have seen Joel Ndabukiye and his son using a club to kill Karegeya. It is so damaging that basically the Defence try to destroy the credibility of Witness CGB, and that's why Witness DJ, Delta Jackie, at paragraph 45 to 50 of our closing brief, says to you that, "I actually know this witness, and this witness was not where he or she claimed to be." In our respectful submission, that is just an attempt by the Defence to destroy the credibility of the only witness who saw what happened to Cyprien Karegeya. Why should we believe Witness DG, anyway? Well, you shouldn't, because we tell you that she has no direct knowledge of any matter which she seeks to testify upon, and we say that in paragraph 51. Her evidence, for the most part, was contradictory. She has expressed her gratitude on how she is especially grateful to her extended family and the Accused for having saved her life, and we say that her testimony is biased. We deal with her challenge of Witness CGB's evidence in paragraph 46 to 50, and we show there that the matters that she testifies on, in an attempt to destroy CBG's testimony, is not credible.The Defence also try to destroy the evidence of Witness CGX and CGF, the two Hutus. So, you see the persistent pattern of conduct. First they tried to destroy the evidence of the only eyewitness to Cyprien Karegeya, the credible witness. Then they go to the Hutu, the two old people, probably in their 70s or 80s. Why would they want to give false testimony? They've come here to say it as they saw it. And then they rely on Witness DV who says, "Well, I happened to be in Gasharu around the same time that the Accused visited at the end of June, and I certainly did not see Witness CGX and Witness CGF present." Well, how in God's name would Witness DV have been looking out for Witness CGX and Witness CG -- CGX or CGF? Presumably he knew ten years ago that he was coming here to testify as a witness, so he wrote it down somewhere in his memory so that he could come and tell us that they were not there. Again, the evidence of Witness CGB is dealt with in our closing brief, and I would only represent to Your Honours as a summary, in the interests of time, that he is not credible for the reasons that we have already stated in his -- in our closing brief.So, we are left with our summary of what happened at Gasharu. In that regard, we refer you to chapter 4, paragraph 96 to 102 of our closing brief. Now, once we throw out the evidence of all the Defence witnesses for inconsistency, we are left with this, and this is what we say: What we have in Gasharu, after we've dealt with all these witnesses, is that we have the evidence of Witness DL, who was a local authority in Gasharu. The Defence case is that, as a measure of good faith and in response to the things that happened in Gasharu, the Accused arrested some individuals, including DL himself. DL says that the man that the Accused arrested had no hand in the killing of Karegeya, so why did he arrest him? Why? Why arrest a man that has no hand in the killing of Karegeya? Your own witness.Now, if you look at all the confession statements that we have adduced in this court, there is no mention of any Gatete, but rather, what we have is a situation whereby in his own home cellule, his nephew, his own brother, and Joel Ndabukiye and his son, Emmanuel Ndagijimana, who the Prosecution say were responsible for the death of Mukantabana, are named and implicated either as principal perpetrators or accomplices. In all the confession statements, one or the other names the other. "He was there. He saw me do this." Including Witness DL himself, witness to crimes in Gasharu.If you read 96 to 102, we now have a situation whereby in Gasharu we have the brother and the nephew of the minister of finance are seen committing genocide in his own cellule, under the watchful eyes of law enforcement agents like Witness DL, the minister himself, and members of his immediate family; license to kill. And then he comes here and he tells you that he is innocent, and you should disregard all we say in chapter 4. Why? In his own cellule. These are the people who are the principal perpetrators of crimes in his own cellule.That brings us to his individual responsibility for Gasharu. We would say that by instigating Witness DL, Joel Ndabukiye, his son Emmanuel, Rukundakuvuga and others, in and around the roadblock at Gitaka centre in Gasharu to kill Tutsis, in particular Cyprien Karegeya and Helen Mukantabana, as charged in the indictment, the Accused is guilty of genocide by having instigated those persons to kill them.If you believe any one of the four witnesses that I have just gone through, then you have to find him guilty on Count 1 and Count 3, crimes against humanity, murder, for the instigation of the killing of these people during the month of May 1994.I now want to go on to Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune. The Prosecution relies on the evidence of three witnesses in support of the allegations in paragraph 15 and 16 for genocide, and paragraphs 20 and 21 for crimes against humanity; three witnesses, Witness CGV, CGN, and CGY.We would argue, Your Honours, as opposed to Gasharu, that the events at Gitwa hill were three separate events, three separate events as testified to by these witnesses. And we would also represent to Your Honours that the events occurred on the following dates: The first event occurred between the 17th and the 20th of April. That's Witness CGV, and I will tell you why when I come back to deal with his or her testimony. Then the second event, April 20th, and the third event, April 23rd, 1994. So in -- for this location, Gitwa hill, we have three events.CGV sought refuge at Gitwa hill on the 15th of April. Two days after his arrival at Gitwa hill, around two days he says, he saw the Accused there, and that's why we've said it's the 17th because he said, "I sought refuge there on or about the 15th." So give or take two days here and there, it has to be between the 17th and the 20th. So we have a broad -- we've given ourselves some latitude in relation to the dates, and that's how come we've arrived at that.First event, CGV: Accused in a white vehicle accompanied by another green Daihatsu. Again, we see the Daihatsu. Inside the Daihatsu were Interahamwe, soldiers, and weapons. CGV saw those weapons off-loaded from the green vehicle. Now, CGV noticed the Accused, Your Honours, holding a grenade in his hand, and he saw the Accused throw the grenade at a group of refugees on Gitwa hill. He -- his evidence is somewhat telling in that he explains how he came to the conclusion that the Accused was the leader of the attacks. He said that the Accused was the most influential personality there. He was a minister, and he was a leader; he was leading. He was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead. And when he came to his native préfecture, he was like an assistant to Habyarimana, who is dead, when he came to his native préfecture to lead the attacks. That's how CGV saw it. Now, CGB is the only witness that gives evidence that indicates a more direct involvement other than the passive conduct, which by no means is little or less culpable but, yet again, passive. His evidence is slightly different. Here we see the Accused throwing a grenade into a crowd as a signal to start off the attack. Perhaps the -- a signal to others to start off. The identification is always a problem in areas where there are numerous attackers, but listen to what CGV says. He had known the Accused before 1994 when he used to work at TRAFIPRO, and he further testified that he hadn't seen the Accused since 1980s 'cause the Accused was living in Kigali, but that he was able to recognise him during the war. He gives a description as to how -- the location where he saw the Accused on the day of the attack and that he distinguished -- he distinguishes the Accused as having been the only one who arrived in the white vehicle with his driver, as opposed to the others who were on the, on the green -- on the green vehicle. He testified that he observed the Accused for a few minutes before the attackers started chasing the refugees. So here you have a witness who has had some time. He knows him, saw him arrive. He's able to identify the vehicle in which he arrives. He identifies the occupants of the vehicles. The attack does not start immediately. He has time to observe him, he tells you that. And then he says, "Once the attack started, I fled." To my mind, is very strong evidence of identification, considering it was daytime.The second event is on the 20th of April, and that's Witness CGN. He says he saw the Accused arriving at Gitwa hill on the 20th of April in a white Daihatsu -- in a white vehicle, I'm sorry, accompanied by a blue vehicle and a green Daihatsu. The green Daihatsu had machetes in it. He also testifies that there were Interahamwe and civilians in the Daihatsu who un -- off-loaded the machetes and distributed them as they disembarked from the vehicles.What did he see the Accused do? He would describe the Accused's role that day as supervising the operation, and he says he gave the order to go to the hills and kill Tutsi. Again, a more direct form of participation than at the roadblocks where he was passive. He heard and saw that this order to kill Tutsi from the Accused came after the machetes were distributed and says the Accused just disappeared after that. He just left; the entourage left. Later that day, he testified that there was an attack on Gitwa hill where several Tutsis were unfortunately killed. Approximate distance in terms of his identification? Twenty-five to thirty metres from the Accused. I would say in the circumstances, very good identification; very good distance to be able to make an effective identification.Third event at Gitwa hill, 23rd April 1994. Witness CGY now testifying that around 11 o'clock in the morning he saw the Accused, again in a white vehicle, accompanied by a blue Daihatsu and a beige Toyota pick-up. So we're having variations on the colours of this Daihatsu, but the Daihatsu is consistent. Some say it's blue; some say it's green. Some say the Accused's car is white. The majority say it's white; one or two people have said it is black. And I will deal with the issues of colours later.Inside the Daihatsu, again, were Interahamwe and civilians. Machetes are off-loaded from the Daihatsu and distributed; consistent. He now heard the Accused direct the machetes to be used in implementing a plan that had been drawn up, and he understood that to mean that the weapons were to be used to kill Tutsi. CGY testifies that on the following days, there were attacks. So he saw the Accused on the 23rd. He describes a major attack on the 26th, and he says, "I would never forget that day because many people died. The 26th is a day that I will never forget." So we see how machetes that are distributed on the 23rd are now used in a huge attack on the 26th, and there's a causal link between the distribution, the aiding and abetting in terms of the supplying of weapons, and the eventual attacks that takes place. So, it lends a substantial hand to whatever happened.Identification: Witness CGY was 20 metres from the Accused when he saw and heard him speak, but he had known him before, also. And he says that from 1990, he used to see the Accused from time to time when he was visiting Kibuye in connection with political rallies. There is no doubt that the Accused did at some stage have political involvement, and that's what got him to the position that he held in 1994. So again, that evidence is not exactly inconsistent with the rest of what we're heard.How do the Defence seek to challenge our evidence? They rely on the evidence of DC, and his analysis can be found at paragraph 168 to 199 of our closing brief, pages 82 -- on pages 82 to 87, at pages 82 to 87 of our brief.Witness DC is a very interesting man. He's a man we've talked about before that likes to assume responsibilities for things that he didn't do. This is a man that, his confession statement, his indictment before the Rwandan authorities, charges him and 69 other people for activities in Rutsiro commune. And ten years after the fact or nine years after the fact, he claims that, "Actually, not only was I at Rutsiro, but I was also at Gitwa hill."We find his evidence incredible. We have dealt with it at length at the pages we've described, but there's some things about his testimony that are striking. First of all, he accepts that the attacks at Gitwa hill were conducted over five days, so it pretty much supports the Prosecution's case that there were actually -- they were actually perpetrated over a period of time.He then claims that he was only there for two of those five days. So if you were there for two out of five days, how can you testify that the Accused was not there? Because he can't actually tell us the two days out of the five days that he was there, so really, that doesn't really tell us anything.And then he says something that is very curious. He says, "Look, had the Accused been there, I would have known."</p>

          <p>So Witness C -- DC says that had the Accused been present -- or if the Accused was present at Gitwa hill, he would have known because the Accused would not have left without providing him some monetary incentive to kill Tutsi. So in other words, we argue that, so if the Accused did not provide that incentive, then it is very unlikely that Witness DC would have known that he was there. That's -- that goes without saying. So the first thing is, the attacks were over five days. How do you know he was not there on day three, four, five? Secondly, if he didn't give you money, then you wouldn't have known he was there. Thirdly, there were -- by his own testimony, Witness DC was one of a thousand men who came from Kibuye, and he was one of 15,000 attackers at Gitwa hill. How, then, would he have been able to tell whether or not the Accused was present? So, that pretty much deals with the defence in relation to evidence on Gitwa hill.What is his responsibility? Well, it's for instigating; instigating on the 17th, on the 20th, and on the 23rd, people to kill civilians. He aided and abetted by leading the convoy, by conveying attackers and machetes. He did that, and he did so knowing that his contribution would materially assist the attackers in the killing of Tutsi. He was a government minister, Your Honours, and he was identified as such. And we would argue in relation to this, like we've done for other events, that that in itself had an encouraging effect on the perpetrators, seeing a government minister whilst the Tutsis are being chased up the hill.He committed, based on the evidence of the witness that saw him throw a grenade, Witness CGV, the only -- like I said at the beginning, the form of participation that's slightly different from the others that we've relied on, committing and basically using the attack -- using the grenade to attack Tutsis gathered on Gitwa hill between the 17th and 20th of April.If you believe any of these witnesses, any one of them, you have to find the Accused guilty on Count 1, genocide, and Count 2, crimes against humanity, for committing, instigating, and aiding and abetting others to kill Tutsis gathered on Gitwa hill.That leaves us with the events at Gitesi commune -- well, one event at Gitesi commune and Kibirizi market. Very quickly, the events at Gitesi commune is based on the evidence of Witness CGH, and it's recorded to have occurred at the end of May -- sorry. I'm sorry, it's recorded to have occurred at the end of April 1994. We have some preliminary remarks to make in relation to Witness CGH's evidence. We would represent to Your Honours that the evidence of Witness CGH, based on its contents, could not have occurred at the end of April. It's more likely to have occurred at the end of May, which is precisely what Witness CGH said in his witness statement. He gives an explanation as to why he thinks or he thought it was at the end of April, and he says that was in connection with the visit of the prime minister to Kibuye on the 3rd of May. But if you look at the evidence of Witness CGH, it becomes apparent that Witness CGH is talking about events that occurred in Gasharu. In essence, he says the Accused said "I'm just coming from Gasharu. This is what happened there." So it couldn't have been at the end of April. It just can't.There are other things that indicate that to us, but it would suffice to say that Witness CGH is being relied on in support of the allegation in paragraph 19 of our indictment. There are certain things that are not disputed by the Defence. CGH is a Tutsi who is married to the sister of Witness DN. That's not disputed. The Defence don't dispute that. CGH testifies that he sought refuge at the home of Witness DN, along with his wife and other members of his family, and stayed there until the 25th of May, 1994, before he fled to Idjwi island in Congo. Again, that is not disputed by the Defence. CGH testified that whilst he was at Witness DN's home, some local authorities, including the Accused, came there to visit Witness DN. Again, that is not disputed. The only bone of contention is that it happened in June or, as Witness CGH says in his evidence, it happened at the end of April. Well, we would actually further complicate that matter and suggest to Your Honours that actually, it didn't happen in June; it didn't happen at the end of April. It actually happened at the end of May because, it goes without saying, when you read what transpired during the visit, there are things that had transpired before the Accused went there. It just follows from the evidence.What did Witness CGH see? Well, he testified that whilst he was at that location, Witness DN's house, he heard the Accused say that he had just come from Kigali where they had killed all the Tutsi, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men. He urged Witness DN to do the same.Now, again we have to put that in perspective. When was it that Tutsi women that had been married to Hutu men were now being targeted? Well, the evidence in the case tells us that this happened sometime in May.Now, in essence, the essence of CGH's testimony is corroborated by CGK, CGM, and CGL, who heard the Accused say a similar thing at different locations and times in Kibuye between a three-month period. Different times, different locations, they hear the same thing. So, that part of his testimony is consistent with the evidence adduced in this case.Then, he then testifies that he heard the Accused say that he had just come from his native cellule where he had been looking for Charles Munyankindi and his family -- Munyankindi is spelledM-U-N-Y-A-N-K-I-N-D-I -- and that he had instructed Joel Ndabukiye to kill Munyankindi and his family. Now, this part of CGH's evidence or testimony is corroborated in all material respects by Witness CGB, CGX, CGF, and CGE. The third part of his evidence goes as follows: He testifies that he heard the Accused in this case promise Witness DN that if Witness DN accomplished the task as outlined earlier, that of killing Tutsis, he, the Accused, would appoint him member of parliament. Now, that evidence is corroborated by Witness DN himself who accepts that he was appointed by the Accused as member of parliament. It is also corroborated by Witness GKH who says, "Well, I relinquished my position, and this is the person who assumed that position." So, so far everything CGH has said is corroborated.One last aspect of his testimony: They all leave Witness DN's house and go out. They go to a trading centre where people are gathered. Witness DN -- sorry, Witness CGH sees two vehicles. He describes them as a dark sedan and a greenish Daihatsu. He saw the Accused hold a meeting at the trading centre below Kibuye prison. He saw machetes on the ground. He testified that those machetes had been transported in the greenish Daihatsu.Now, the essence of Witness CGH's testimony, in my respectful submission, is that the Accused conveyed and distributed weapons at Gitesi. Now, that, again, is corroborated by many witnesses who saw him do the same thing. It is in reliance of such strong corroboration that I am able to stand here and represent to you that if Witness CGH testified that the event occurred at the end of April, then he must have been mistaken as to the dates, because the essence of everything he said has corroboration. There's nothing that he has said in his testimony that we haven't heard from somebody else in all material respects. We represent to you that if he testified, which he did, that this event occurred at the end of April, then he was mistaken.In terms of the identification, CGH, I don't think there's much dispute as to whether or not CGH and the Accused are known to each other. Even the Accused pretty much says that that is his biggest bone of contention. CGH is a man who has been particularly troubling for the Defence in this case, and there's no doubt that they've known each other in Gasharu cellule for several years.When the off-loading of materials and weapons was being done from the Daihatsu, he testified that he was less than 200 metres from where the Accused stood. It would seem like a terribly long distance, but again, I would only represent that he is credible. He may have been mistaken as to the length of the distance, and 200 metres, well, I wouldn't see anything 200 metres, but that is not to say that he did not mean a distance that was substantially less, but people do run off figures as to distances without actually appreciating what 200 metres is like. So, that is my submission in relation to that.The Defence have sought to challenge the evidence we have adduced in relation to this event by relying on the evidence of Witness DN. Witness DN's testimony is dealt with at length in our closing brief, and I'm not going to dwell on it any longer but just to say that it's on pages 99 to 104 of our closing brief at paragraphs 267 to 297. In essence, our view is that Witness DN, whilst he's credible in relation to certain things, has sought to diminish his role and that of the Accused in relation to others, and I will leave the matter at that and leave his credibility to Your Honours to decide.Therefore, we would represent to you that if you accept the evidence of Witness CGH, then you have to find, clearly, that the Accused aided and abetted in the distribution of weapons to civilians at Gitesi and instigated Witness DN, by offering him an inducement, to kill Tutsi women that were married to Hutu men. Again, it's a sole testimony, and on the basis of this single event, you can convict the Accused for genocide.The last event is at Kibirizi market, Rubengera, in Mubanza commune, which is slightly out of the scope of everything we've talked about being in Gitesi commune but is still in Kibuye préfecture. The evidence is that of Witness CGL who's testified to a single event: seeing the Accused at Kibirizi market. The paragraph in the indictment that we would rely on, basically, would be paragraph 1 to 5 of our indictment in support of the genocide count. And the evidence of CGL is, is interesting in that at the end of May, she testifies to seeing the Accused at Kibirizi market -- which is spelled K-I-B-I-R-I-Z-I <stage>(sic)</stage> -- making a speech instigating people to kill Tutsis. He then distributed weapons and he left. But she also heard the Accused say the following to people, say this to the people gathered: "In Kigali, Tutsi have already been killed, including Tutsi women married to Hutu men." Now, this is perhaps the sixth, seventh witness in this case who is going to say the same thing. Situate the comments to the time, end of May. Makes a lot of sense. She then heard the Accused instruct the Interahamwe to off-load machetes from a Daihatsu vehicle and distribute them amongst a civilian Hutu population. We would represent to Your Honours that the conduct of the Accused at Kibirizi is consistent with his conduct at various other places in Kibuye as reflected in this indictment. His instigation for people to kill Tutsi women that are married to Hutu men should be placed in its proper context, because they had previously been spared. This is the end of May. How do the Defence deal with our case? They challenge it by calling Witness DF, a very interesting witness, indeed. Witness DF is a fairly old, reverent gentleman who seems to be all over the place and cannot really explain why he moves around so much. But what is so interesting about Witness DF's testimony is that -- which you will find on pages 110 to 113 and paragraphs 341 to 355, is that Witness DN has an axe to grind with everybody. He was an axe to grind with Ibuka. He claims our witnesses are all members of Ibuka. He claims the Accused can do no wrong, and all these charges are trumped-up charges. But what is most fascinating about him is that he claims that the Kibirizi market was closed throughout the entire period, so that even Hutus didn't have to eat. Well, we find his testimony very interesting, and we have dealt with his credibility and his -- the matters affecting his credibility at the -- in the closing brief, as I've indicated.Consequently, Your Honours, if you find that you believe Witness CGL, we would say that the Accused is responsible for genocide by having aided and abetted, by conveying those machetes in the Daihatsu vehicle to Kibirizi market, by distributing the machetes to Hutu civilians and militia to use in the killing of Tutsi civilians, and that he's also guilty of genocide by having instigated those present at Kibirizi market to kill Tutsi civilians, especially Tutsi women that were married to Hutu men, at the end of May. Again, we draw your Chamber's attention -- Your Honours' attention, rather, to the general context in which several of these matters were taking place in the country.If you believe Witness CGL, then please return a verdict of guilty for genocide, as I have pointed out.There are certain things that are consistent throughout the testimony: the number of cars used, usually more than one; the colour of the cars, mostly white; the greenish Daihatsu following behind; the fact that the greenish Daihatsu always had weapons in it; weapons were often off-loaded and distributed. These are striking similarities that indicate a consistent pattern of conduct. At paragraph 93 of our closing brief in chapter 4 at page 47, we have indicated that the relatively passive conduct of the Accused often involved instigating or aiding and abetting others to carry out crimes in furtherance of the genocidal policy of the government of which he had actual and constructive notice of. Now, if he was part of the government and he sat at those cabinet meetings, he obviously had constructive notice of what the policy of the government was. If you hold the policies of the government in one hand and you hold our indictment in your other hand, you would see striking similarities in the Accused's conduct in Gitesi commune at this time.Working hand in hand with the local authorities like Witness DN -- and we've gone to great length in chapter 4 to outline why the Accused's relationship with Witness DN was particularly important. So working hand in hand with the local authorities, we say that the Accused provided the enabling environment by which the crimes were committed at various locations in his commune and cellule of origin. He failed to investigate these crimes, and we've given you an example of the steps he said he took to investigate. Even though it must have been obvious to him that the perpetrators of these crimes were known to him -- some of them were his close relatives; some of them were his close relatives -- and we say that his failure to investigate or apprehend or condemn those massacres in his home commune -- or cellule, rather, and commune, constituted his tacit approval that those crimes were to be committed therein.Your Honours -- Your Honour asked me a question in relation to chapter 4 earlier. I did promise that I would deal with it in the course of my arguments. I hope I have, and if I haven't, I'm willing to answer any questions you might have. </p>

On chapter 4, that chapter contains some arguments that are based on guilty pleas, previous judgements, testimony by an expert witness in the present case; in other words, criteria that are there. But you also have some points that seem to be a little bit more vague. You talk about the Accused's political ambitions, how he strategically positioned himself on two occasions, and thirdly, how he was known to be opposed to power sharing.Now, I mentioned three elements.

          <p>Good afternoon, Your Honours. As admitted earlier on, I will address the Defence closing brief on basically three issues: One, that will be in relation to the defects in the indictment; the other aspect will relate to problems that Defence have pointed out in relation to their inability to prepare the alibi; and finally, I'll deal with certain evidentiary matters the Defence have alleged that they fall outside of the scope of the indictment. And our questions on the assessment of Prosecution case, on all the seven massacre sites in which we charge the Accused person with, and the assessment of the Defence credibility on the Defence witnesses have, I think, been ably dealt with by my learned colleague.Now, let me start by saying, Your Honours, that your role in this case was to hear and assess the evidence and, based on that assessment, determine if the Prosecutor has proven his case beyond reasonable doubt. Now, this standard is very high. It is designed to ensure that an accused is only convicted if the only credible explanation for the evidence presented is that he is responsible for the crimes for which he is charged.Now, if, after evaluating the evidence on record, you have a doubt to any of the three counts the Accused stands charged with, you must acquit him of that count or counts. On the contrary, if, after evaluating the evidence, you find that the Prosecutor has proved beyond a reasonable doubt all the counts, all the counts, you have a duty to convict him on all of them.I submit to Your Honours that after evaluating the evidence led by the Prosecution in support of the charges, you will conclude that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, he is guilty as charged of all the three counts laid at his door in the indictment and proceed to convict him accordingly.Now, let me now turn to the Defence brief. In paragraphs 22 to 24, the Defence contend that the testimony of Prosecution witnesses is not credible because it's riddled with inconsistencies, errors, or that it's simply implausible. As I said, my colleague has dealt with, with this question at length, and it is discussed, in part, in our closing brief in paragraph 6 to 16. All I can say here is that when you have alleged inconsistencies and errors such as the ones raised by the Defence, you have, Your Honours, a duty to evaluate them. You have to look at them and determine if they're significant or not. You have to look at them and determine why they occurred. Is it -- is that of a number of things in a different way, or is it a cultural problem, or perhaps the problem is that of passage of time, or trauma, or could it be a problem of translation, or it could be -- could it be the result of an intentional untruth? These are pointers Your Honours will have to take into account in assessing the -- in determining the credibility of the witnesses.Your Honours, I submit that the alleged errors and inconsistencies are a result of trauma and passage of time. The witnesses are reliving these harrowing events, some like Witness CGV, for the third time. You will recall, Your Honours, CGV testified in the Musema case, he testified in Ntakirutimana case, and he testified in this case as well.Now, these events conjure up memories of death, sometimes of loved ones, under the most horrific circumstances. Witnesses testify to events that occurred over nine years ago. We all know that with the passage of time, memories tend to fade, and in the premises <stage>(sic),</stage> they're bound to be inconsistencies of some sort which, as we submit, are attributable to human frailties. What is important, Your Honours, is that alleged errors and inconsistencies are not intentional untruths.Let me turn to the problem of exclusion of evidence. In paragraphs 109 to 111 of the Defence closing brief, the Defence have requested that the testimony relating to the Kibuye 3rd of May meeting, the participation of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi in the interim government, and events which occurred at the Kibirizi market be excluded from the record.Now, it's our submission, as intimated to by my learned brother, that the Kibuye meeting and the participation of the Accused in the government are relevant to the case as they form the contextual background within which we have shown the Accused persons <stage>(sic)</stage> committed the crimes as alleged in the indictment. They are the circumstances under which we invite Your Honours to say that it is on the basis of these things that the Accused person formed the necessary genocidal intent to commit the genocide and the necessary requisite intent to commit the crimes against humanity and murder. And in this regard, the Kibuye meeting and the question of participation of the Accused in the interim government are evidence of the background of the case in terms of Article 17 <stage>(4)</stage> of the Statute and Rule 47 <stage>(C)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.The Kibirizi incident, Your Honour, is relevant as forming a consistent pattern of conduct under Rule 93 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, as explained in paragraph 73, chapter 3, of the Prosecutor's closing brief. As intimated earlier on, the event -- the seven events the Accused is charge with in Kibuye start with Kibirizi. Kibirizi is right at the border between Kibuye préfecture and Gitarama, and that is where we say the Accused started his escapades, as far as the indictment is concerned. It is here that we say that he stopped, made some instigation remarks, distributed weapons, went to Fayer, did the same; and then Nyabahanga, he did the same; to Gasharu, and did the same; and Gitwa as well, where in addition to instigation and distribution of weapons, he participated in the attacks on Tutsi civilians.So it's the Prosecutor's contention, Your Honours, that events at he Kibirizi market form a part of the pattern that is consistent with the, with the conduct of the Accused person, and this is important, Your Honours, in assessing the culpability of the Accused for the crimes for which he stands charged.In paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Defence brief --</p>

        <sp who="#mr-kapaya">
          <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
          <p>All right.Now I come to the testimony of Defence Witness DN. There is a contention in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the Defence closing brief that the Prosecution, we say in one breath that DN is a credible witness, and in another breath we say that DN is not a credible witness. And Your Honour, that is exactly the position we hold as regards this particular witness.Now, it's our humble submission, Your Honours, that it is possible for the Trial Chamber to dichotomise the testimony of a witness in two parts, the credible -- the credible part and the not credible part. Now, this is a phenomenon which has occurred previously in the Trial Chambers before this Tribunal. I will recall Your Honour in the Bagilishema case where this very Trial Chamber had to grapple with that kind of problem. There was the question of Witnesses YY and ZZ. These are witnesses who manned a certain roadblock referred to as TRAFIPRO in Mabanza commune, Kibuye préfecture. Now, when it came to assessing the credibility of these witnesses, the Trial Chamber said, quite specifically, that they would believe anything the witness said that implicated him and they would disbelieve anything the witness said that implicated Bagilishema. So there was this particular approach whereby the testimony of a witness is divided into parts -- into two parts, the credible and the not credible part, and we urge Your Honours to apply the ratio decidendi in that decision to the -- when assessing the testimony of Witness DN in this matter.Now I turn to the allegations of defects in the indictment. The Defence contend, in paragraph 48 to 43 and 1141 to 1147 of their brief, that the indictment is defective on two fronts. They say that it's wrong -- firstly, it's wrong to rely on the same set of facts to prove genocide and crimes against humanity; and two, they claim that the indictment, as it stands, is vague. I start with the last one, the same set of facts to prove genocide and crimes against humanity. Now, the Defence based their claim on the basis that the elements of the three crimes, that is, genocide, murder, and extermination, are the same. That is what they say in paragraph 48 to 60 of their brief. They also say that the victims, namely Tutsi, are the same. In this regard, they give an example that we used the same set of evidence, namely the matters of Mukantabana and Karegeya, to prove genocide and crimes against humanity, murder, and events at Gitwa hill in April 1994 to support genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity.Now, the Prosecutor submits that it's legally tenable to charge an Accused person with multiple offences based on the same set of facts. It is tenable particularly where the offences, like in the present case, that is genocide and crimes against humanity, have different elements and aim to protect different societal or -- societal interests or societal values. Now, the use of the same set of facts to prove the offenses is intended to reflect the totality of the Accused person's culpability, and if found guilty of the offences, the sentences imposed for the various offences are usually ordered to run concurrently. In the circumstances, what is punishable is the culpable conduct. The ICTY and ICTR have consistently opined that the issue of cumulative charges should be addressed at the stage of sentencing, that is, by sentencing the Accused concurrently for the established crimes when they are supported by the same culpable conduct. This has been the practice in the Kayesu, Rutaganda, Ntakirutimana, Musema, Niyitegeka, and I actually can't think of a case decided by this Tribunal where this principle -- where the Kayishema decision has been followed.Now, Your Honour, we have said that the practice of cumulative charging is accepted in this Tribunal where the offences have different elements and where the laws in question protect the different societal interests. Whereas the Kayishema judgement correctly stated that the test to be applied -- whereas the Kayishema judgement correctly stated the test to be applied, it misapplied it on the facts of that case, and that decision has not, as I said, been followed in any subsequent decisions by this Tribunal.Now, let's look at the elements criteria. We submit to Your Honours that genocide and crimes against humanity have different elements and are not the same offence, as implied by the Defence. Whereas genocide requires special intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a social group, crimes against humanity require that the crimes be committed on a widespread or systematic manner. Now, in this respect, a single item of evidence may be used to prove two or more completely different facts. For instance, the same evidence might be used to prove the existence of widespread or systematic attack, an element of crimes against humanity, and to prove the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, an element of genocide.This would not mean that a widespread or a systematic attack is the same thing as an intent to destroy a group in whole or in part. Furthermore, it would not mean that genocide and crimes against humanity have the same elements. The Defence argument appears to proceed on the premise that the counts of extermination, in all manner, are subsumed fully by the counts of genocide. Now, and this was part of the finding in Kayishema. The Prosecution submits that there is no legal basis for that finding. Now, as Judge Khan's dissenting opinion points out in that judgement, that is, paragraph 32 of the sentencing judgement, "Such a view defeats the very scheme and object of the law."Now, as regards the second element, that's the societal value or interest for which the crimes protect, the Prosecution submits that it's erroneous to say that genocide and extermination or murder protect the same values or social interest, that's the lives of Tutsi civilians. The fact that all three crimes were perpetrated against the same victim, that is Tutsi, all of whom had the same status, that is civilians, does not mean that the three crimes protect the same values or same interests.Genocide with its requirement of any intent to destroy an ethnic group, in whole or in part, serves to protect the Tutsi victims as an ethnic group, as such. The criminalisation of genocide protects defined groups against acts aimed at their destruction, in whole or in part. The interest which this provision is designed to protect is the right of such groups to exist as such, and not be subjected to attacks against their existence.Unlike war crimes or genocide, crimes against humanity require, as a matter of law, a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population. In general, the prohibition of crimes against humanity seeks to protect civilian populations from large-scale or repetitive patterns of persecution or inhumane acts. The prohibition of crimes against humanity thus serves to protect the victims from widespread or systematic attacks in their capacity as a civilian population, and not in their capacity as an ethnic group.The rules proscribing crimes against humanity are designed to protect populations against large-scaled, organised attacks against them, and thus address the perpetrators' conduct, not only towards an immediate victim but also towards the whole of mankind. The fact that each Tutsi --</p>

          <speaker>MR. KAPAYA:</speaker>
          <p>Thank you, Your Honour.Your Honour, it's our submission that the provisions of Rule 17 <stage>(4)</stage> and Rule 47 <stage>(C)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence have to be read in conjunction with the provisions of Article 20 <stage>(2),</stage> subrule 4 <stage>(a)</stage> and <stage>(b),</stage> of the same Statute. Now, these provisions provide, in effect, that in the determination of any charges against an accused person, he is entitled a fair hearing and, more particularly, to be informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him and to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence.Now, in the jurisprudence of the ad hoc Tribunals -- that's the ICTY and this Tribunal -- these provisions translate into an obligation on the part of the Prosecution to state the material facts underpinning the charges, but not the evidence by which such material facts can be proven.Now, the question whether an indictment -- the indictment in the present case is defective depends on a concrete assessment of each allegation and involves a comparison of the material that was available to the Prosecution before the trial and evidence that was adduced at trial. Your Honour, it's our humble submission that, even if an indictment appears defective on the face of it, it may be cured by provision to the Defence of timely, clear and consistent information, detailing the factual basis of the charges. In the Kupreskic case, which the Defence have cited, it will say that in order to assess whether the Accused was sufficiently informed of the charges, the Appeals Chamber considered disclosed evidence, the information conveyed in the Prosecution's pre-trial brief and the knowledge acquired during trial, and we submit that a similar approach should be adopted in this case.Now, paragraphs 1 to 5 of the indictment, which contain the words the Defence complain of, should not be read in isolation of the other provisions of the indictment. These appear to be introductory paragraphs and, as we say, they support the allegations for genocide. And, as you progress from the subsequent paragraphs in the indictment, you see that what is contained in paragraphs 1 to 5 is narrowed down and specified with more particulars in the subsequent paragraphs where we submit, Your Honours, that the Prosecutor's pre-trial disclosure; in particular, the witness statements as detailed in paragraphs 11 to 15 of the pre-trial brief. Their request to admit referred to paragraph 14 of the pre-trial brief and knowledge acquired during the trial put the Defence on sufficient notice of all their allegations levelled against the Accused in this indictment.Your Honours will recall the Kupreskic requirements were raised in the Ntakirutimana case, as against the so-called "Bisesero" indictment. In paragraph 59 of the trial judgment, this Trial Chamber found that the pre-trial disclosure did cure the apparent defects that appeared in that Bisesero indictment. We urge Your Honours to apply the same test and look at the matters we have referred to, to show whether the matters complained to by -- complained of by the Defence are not curable by the disclosures that we made in the course of this trial.Paragraphs 69 to 73 of the Defence brief raise an issue relating to confusion as to the identity of certain victims. When you read paragraphs 6 to 9 and 26 to 28 of the indictment there appears to be a confusion as to whether Tatiane Nyiramaritete and Helen Mukantabana are two different people, and whether Tatiane Nyiramaritete is a man or a woman. The Prosecution submits that this should not have come as surprise to the Defence as they were aware of it well before the trial started. That question is clarified in paragraphs 139 and 146 of the pre-trial brief, where it is stated clearly that Tatiane Nyiramaritete and Helen Mukantabana are one and the same person and that this person is, in fact, a woman.Now, the pre-trial brief was filed on the 1st of August 2003, which was a month before the trial started. Needless to say, the matter was clarified further by Witness CGB who testified to that issue in the course of the trial. The Defence cannot, therefore, on this account be said to have been prejudiced in the way -- by that apparent confusion.As regards the dates, they also say in paragraph -- in the same paragraphs the Defence complain about the vagueness as to dates in the indictment. Paragraphs 7 and 26 of the indictment allege that Mukantabana and Karegeya were murdered in April; whereas, paragraphs 8, 27 and 28 of the indictment allege that the same persons were killed in May.Now, the indictment was drafted on the basis of witness statements at a time when the Prosecutor did not know about the true identities of the two individuals; that's one. Following reconfirmation of the witnesses and subsequent trial, the Prosecution was well apprised of the matter and, in the interests of fairness to both the parties and the Prosecution, we are not relying now on the paragraphs 6, 7 and 28 of the indictment to prove the -- to prove the wrong -- the indictment; in other words, Your Honours, we shall not be offering any evidence on paragraphs 6, 7 and 26 of the indictment. These are the paragraphs that state that the two people, Mukantabana and Karegeya, were killed in April '94. And this leaves us with paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 27 and 28, which said -- which say that the two people -- that is, Mukantabana and Karegeya -- were killed in early May. Now, on the basis --</p>

          <p>Yes, Your Honour. Our submission is that there is no prejudice now because we have withdrawn the paragraphs which brought the confusion. So, we are not saying anymore that Mukantabana and Karegeya were killed in April; what we are saying is that they were killed toward the end of May '94. That's the basis of the case we are proceeding on against the accused person.The Defence go further and say that in paragraphs 8, 9, 27 and 28 of the indictment. We say that the Accused instigated the matter of Karegeya and Mukantabana in early May '94; whereas, all the witnesses we called in support of this event testified that the instigation occurred in late May '94. They claim, therefore, that there is a contradiction between what is alleged in the indictment and what the witnesses testified to.Now, when you look at the testimony of the witnesses, you will find, Your Honours, that Witness CGB testified in court that the Accused instigated the death of Karegeya and Mukantabana in early May, that is, paragraph 22, chapter 3 of the closing brief; CGX said it was the end of May, paragraph 10 of the closing brief; CGE said it was late May, paragraph 18, chapter 3 of the closing brief; whereas, CGF also said that it was towards the end of May '94. As we said earlier, Your Honour, the indictment was -- the apparent confusion came about because the indictment was drafted on the basis of witness statements. When you look at those witness statements, you will find, Your Honours, that Witness CGB -- the Witness CGB places the incident in early May. The statement of Witness CGE placed the incident in May -- they don't say early, middle or late May; whereas, the statement of CGX and CGF do not give any dates at all. So, it is not correct, as the Defence contend, that the witness statements speak of a different date; whereas, the witnesses came to court and spoke of a different date. So it was a question of construction, and the witnesses give their reasons why they specified the period as late May and not at any other time.The fact remains, Your Honours, that the incident occurred in May and that, as we said, each of the three witnesses explained why they gave the date as early May. And we say, Your Honours, that, considering the contents of the witness statements as to the dates of the incident and the oral testimony of the witnesses in court, no prejudice whatsoever was occasioned to the Defence. At any rate, the date referred to by the witnesses does not, Your Honours, fall between the 11th and 17th of May, the period the Prosecution concedes on the basis of the passport -- that's the Defence Exhibit D. 63 -- that the Accused had an almost watertight alibi. It falls in a period where the Accused, as my learned brother has argued, has no alibi at all. Had it fallen between these dates and then the witnesses had testified to something different, then one could have implied the witnesses could have had an ill motive in testifying to what they did.Your Honours, in paragraph 15 and 16 of the indictment, it is averred that the Accused instigated -- conveyed attackers and participated in attacks on Tutsi civilian at Gitwa hill in Gitesi commune between 13th and 26th of April 1994. The Defence complained, in paragraph 77, that the witness statements of CGY, CGN and CGV, who testified about this incident, show that it occurred between the 20th and 25th of April 1994. The Prosecution submits, Your Honours, that the assertion is simply incorrect.Witness CGN's statement says it was around 14th April in one statement, and 20th to 25 of April in another statement; while Witness CGV gave the date as 13th or 14th of April; and the statement of CGY places it on the 23rd of April 1994. Again, there is no contradiction whatsoever as the dates, 20th and 25th April, fall within the period covered by the paragraphs 15 and 16 of the indictment; that is, 13th to 26 of April 1994. And, finally, Your Honour, this period is well supported by testimony in court. CGV testified that he saw the Accused at Gitwa hill twice: that is, on April 14th at noon throwing a grenade at refugees -- you see that at paragraph 51 of our closing brief; and he saw him again on the 17th of April. This is referred to in paragraphs 48 and 48 <stage>(sic)</stage> of the brief. CGN testified he saw the Accused at Gitwa hill on 20th April, paragraph 40 of the closing brief; and CGY saw him on the 23rd of April. So, it is our submission, Your Honours, that there is no vagueness or any incorrectness as to dates regarding the incidents at Gitwa hill.There is also -- we also -- I move to the question concerning the alibi of the Accused. Your Honours, as we all recall, Defence raised their defence of alibi. Basically, Your Honours, what the Accused was telling you is that he was not where we say he was. During the time and place, as we say, he was instigating genocide in Gasharu, or distributing weapons at roadblocks, or throwing grenades at Tutsi civilians in Gitwa. He says that we are not speaking the truth. He claims he was not doing any of these things, and he tries to explain why.Now, we discuss his alibi at length in paragraphs 30 to 31 of chapter 5 <stage>(sic)</stage> of the brief. Now, in this regard the Defence claim, in paragraphs 841 -- or 6 of the brief, that it was difficult, therefore, to prepare the defence of alibi for two reasons: one, that indictment is vague; and, two, that witnesses kept on shifting dates in the course of trial. We have already, Your Honours, dealt with the issue relating to the indictment and the shifting of dates. We submit that, in no way, did these matters prejudice the Accused in the preparation of his alibi defence.The Accused produced only one alibi witness, Defence Witness DP. His testimony is analysed in paragraphs 15 to 31, part 5, of the Prosecution closing brief. And the passport, Defence Exhibit 63, and the hotel bills that the Accused produced as Defence Exhibit 62 provide the Accused with an alibi for the period 11th to 17th of May.In the Defence closing brief, they have set three periods in which they say that they had problems with the preparation of the alibi. The first period runs from 8th to 9th of April, that is Kigali. In paragraph 89 of the Defence <stage>(sic)</stage> they say that -- the Accused says that on the 8th and the 9th of April 1994 he was in Kigali - that was the date when he was sworn in; whereas, in paragraphs 6 and 26 of the indictment, we tend to say that he was somewhere doing some other things. We have already stated, Your Honours, that the Prosecution has abandoned the allegation in paragraphs 6 and 26 of the indictment and, therefore, this complaint is moot.Then there is period 12th, 13th and 14th of April, Gitarama. This period relates to activities of the Accused in Gitwa hill and is the subject of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the indictment. The Defence claim that the Accused was in Gitarama during this period, and DP purports to support this. Now, our analysis of the testimony of DP shows that alibi was not watertight. In paragraph 102 of the Defence brief, DP is quoted as saying the Accused could not have travelled to Kibuye from Gitarama on account of the distance. Now, our investigator Mr. Baghel testified and produced evidence, Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, to show that Gitarama and Kibuye actually are hardly 76 kilometres apart -- these are préfectures which border one another -- and that the condition of the road in 1994 was good, such that one could make the journey in an hour and a half, and back. So -- and there was no evidence led by the Defence to rebut that.The other period is between 11th and 18th May '94 when the Accused says he was in Nairobi. Now, the Prosecution accepts that the Accused was out of the country in this period and does not wish to attribute any wrongdoing to him for this period and, in this regard, the Prosecution is offering no evidence as regards paragraphs 17, 18, 22, 23 and 24 of the indictment.

          <p>The other period referred to is 19th May to 30th of May, and our contention, Your Honours, is that this relates to the activities at seven crimes scenes; that is Gasharu, Fayer, Nayabahanga, Gaseke, Gitesi and Kibirizi market. The Defence have claimed that they could overstretch the 11th to 18th of May alibi to cover this period. In our humble submission, Your Honours, it does not, and for this period it is our contention and our case that the Accused does not have an alibi for the events which we say he did at these seven massacre -- these seven crime scenes. So, Your Honours, save for the eight paragraphs -- that is, paragraph 6, 7, 17, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 26 -- where the Prosecution offers no evidence, we urge the Trial Chamber to find the rest of the paragraphs proved beyond sane doubt, and to proceed to convict the Accused accordingly.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Mr. President, Your Honours, if I'm allowed at this juncture of the trial to put -- set out my personal opinion, I'll say that we on the Defence are totally convinced of the innocence of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. The Prosecutor's closing arguments has not weakened our conviction. On the contrary, masks have fallen down; issues which have been in suspense for a long time have received the answers. Yesterday we were surprised by the fact that half of the indictment fell through -- collapsed during the hearing, and this is spectacular and rare. The other half of the indictment is still there, but it's too late, Your Honours, to find makeshift solutions, because truth keeps going forward and no one can stop it. Today we will see how the indictment was set out, and it was done blindly, so to speak. Yesterday, at 4:30 p.m., the Prosecutor confessed that the indictment had been drafted on the basis of witness statements; whereas, the Prosecutor was not aware of the identity of the victims. I'd like to add that he was not informed about the dates; he was not informed about the venues, the localities or even about the presence of the Accused on those sites. So all those fanciful statements made at the beginning of the trial are done with. Today we have to take into account the social - cultural context. This signifies that, according to the Prosecutor, 200 metres for a witness can be ten to 20 metres; or 9th of April 1994 is transported miraculously to the 30th of May 1994. Mr. President, Your Honours, we agree on only one point in respect of the Prosecution's closing arguments which were made yesterday, and that point is that, before this Tribunal, the standard of evidence is very high, and those standards have not been achieved by the Prosecutor at all. I'm convinced, Mr. President, Your Honours, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is innocent of the crimes with which he's charged. And I've had this conviction since my trip to Rwanda in Kibuye in the Gasharu préfecture in 2002. I have to talk to -- tell you about the Kibuye préfecture but, particularly, the Gasharu cellule because I believe that I'm the only one here who had the opportunity to go there. I don't want to make a submission of our -- the Defence brief. I think that we have submitted 175 pages of legal explanation, matters concerning witnesses, so I'm trying, really, to broaden the scope and moving on to something else. Gasharu is a small cellule which is reached when you leave Gitarama going towards Kibuye. You come to that cellule, and the distance is about 66, 70 kilometres. The road now is good, but in 1994 the road was not good. The Prosecutor told you, Your Honours, yes, they said - and, yesterday, too, at five past 5:00 with regard to Prosecution Exhibit 2, the expert -- that is, the investigator of the Tribunal -- showed that the distance between Gitarama and Kibuye is not more than 66 kilometres and that the state of road in 1994 -- in nineteen -- was good, so much so that you could reach -- you could travel between the two points in 90 minutes. This is important, Mr. President, Your Honours, in view of the alibi defence of the Accused. And if we are to look at the statement made by that investigator on the 1st of September nine -- 2003, and I have before me the statement, page 19, that is, the transcript, the Defence asked the investigator: "With regard to the portion of the road between Gitarama and Kibuye, can you describe to us the state of the road and its quality at the time -- the surface quality at that time?" And the answer of that investigator was: "In fact, I took that road on several occasions, and within the context of my report, I took that road on the days which I mentioned during 2003; that is, from the 11th to the 18th. At that time, the road was tarmacked; that is, between Gitarama and Kibuye." Question by Defence: "Do you know about the state of that road in 1994?""No, I don't have information about the state of that road in 1994.""Didn't you ask the authorities what was the state of the road in 1994, because that's of interest to us?"Answer of the investigator: "No, I didn't ask this specific question. I didn't put it to the authorities, that is, in respect of the state of road in 1994." Mr. President, Your Honours, people who travel lid on that road before the year 2000 know that it's a dirt road and one need not one and a half hours only to cover the distance between Gitarama and Kibuye, but one needed double that time. When you go towards Kibuye you have to turn left, approximately at a place named Kayenzi, and there you take a real dirt road. And you somehow travel for about 45 minutes, one hour in order to reach the Gitaka centre. The Gitaka centre is not a market. It's not a village square either; there's no church. They are not real traders; there's just something put up, which you know, Mr. President, because during the trial mention was made of it on several occasions. Now, in Gitaka you have about 15, 20 houses, and when you are there, you still not -- have not reached Gasharu. You have to park the vehicle there and walk through a path going up towards the mountain -- or, rather, on the hills up to the Gasharu cellule. And when you get to Gasharu cellule, you don't know where you are because there's nothing to indicate to you where you are because the Gasharu cellule has about 15 wooden and mud earthern houses grouped on a hill, and in that cellule you have ten, 12, maximum of 15 families. It is there in that cellule where the Accused hails from: that is where he was born; that is where he grew up; that is where he had a relationship with members of his family as well as his neighbours when growing up. The Gasharu cellule has the specificity of being inhabited by as many Tutsis as Hutus. And between the 1950s and 1994, that cellule was not mentioned when it came to ethnic confrontation. Even in 1994 the genocide did not strike Gasharu that hard because there weren't many people to be eliminated there. Genocide in Kibuye took place on -- when you talk of the 18th of April 1994, when you had more than 10,000 people dead at the Home Saint-Jean, at the church, at the stadium in that Bisesero area; 200,000 Tutsis perished in the course of April and beginning of May in 1994 in Kibuye. But this does not mean that other Tutsis were not killed in their areas of inhabitation and areas of birth. Indeed, some Tutsis, those who were not lucky or who did not have the opportunity to escape, were murdered in Gasharu and its environs. But today, when 2002 Defence teams went to Gasharu, they were not expected and the population were there to see who are these muzungu who had come to see them and to ask -- seek information from them. I would like to assure you, Mr. President, Your Honours, that no one, no one, said a word against Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, either in Gasharu or anywhere else. This is one of the strengths of the conviction of the Defence, and which is my conviction as well. The Prosecutor has his certainty and we have our certainties, and our certainties are not based on my personal opinion; our certainties are based on elements which constitute the pillar on which, later, I'll ask for the acquittal of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi. The first element is the weakness or shortcoming in the indictment.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Before you move on to that -- before you move on to that, Mr. Besnier, you have provided information now and, in particular, you stress that it is of importance that you can't travel from Gitarama to Kibuye in one and a half hours; it takes double. That would lead us to three hours. Do you have any further references, in your brief or, now, when it comes to evidence for the travelling time during that period?</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>No, Mr. President. The answer arises from my personal experience, which is not admissible before this Court. We also drew it from the transcript which I read out to you. I highlighted the fact that that investigator, who claimed that he travelled between the two points in one and a half hours, did not come to check to see that that road was in a bad state in 1994. So these are the elements on which I base my assertion. So now I'd like to go to the elements which I'll use as the basis for our seeking the Emmanuel Ndindabahizi acquittal. Firstly, I said shortcoming of the indictment. Secondly, we'll talk about the fact that the Accused was totally unknown in Kibuye in Rwanda and even here in this International Criminal Tribunal and -- its investigators up to July 2000. We'll also raise the issue about the weakness and the lack of credibility of Prosecution witnesses. Lastly, we'll talk about the strength and the credibility of Defence witnesses. Now, with regard to the shortcoming or the weakness in the indictment, to be brief, we can first mention the various indictments which were set out successively in this case. You had the indictment of the 5th of July 2001, which included direct incitement to genocide as one of the counts. And then you had the indictment of the 5th of October 2001, which added to the first count, rape, and command responsibility. And then there was the indictment, on which we're still working, which came out on the 30th of June 2003, which withdrew from the previous indictment incitement, rape, and responsibility, pursuant to Article 6 <stage>(3)</stage> of the Statute. What is more surprising in this case, Mr. President, Your Honours, is that, in spite of the considerable streamlining of the indictment from 2003, the Prosecutor has persisted trying the Accused for political reasons. With regard to the facts remaining in the indictment, we think that more than two-thirds of the indictment were not touched upon by Prosecution witnesses. It's obvious that, to our great surprise, yesterday evening the Prosecutor abandoned a major part of the paragraphs of the indictment. But just to mention a few examples: what can we do with paragraph 14 of the indictment, for instance? Paragraph 14 talks about the Karongi site. What happened to that charge, to that accusation? Where and when did witnesses come here or go anywhere to talk about criminal activities of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at that particular site? So will the Prosecutor look at that -- those accusations? Will they look for witnesses, or simply they leave this accusation to go to oblivion? Mr. President, what can also one talk about charges which are still in the indictment, but which have gone through a variation of dates and places, so much so that no one can recognise the indictment? Finally, this indictment, even in its amended form, has repetitive legal defects which can only lead the Court to declare it null and void totally. I'll come back to that in a few moments' time. Second relevant point, which is the basis of the Defence conviction regarding the innocence of the Accused, is that Ndindabahizi was totally unknown to Rwandans, to investigators of the Tribunal, and to anyone up to June 2001; that is, when the indictment was confirmed by Judge Dolenc. The Accused, Ndindabahizi, between 1994 and 2001, never had -- he was a refugee in Nairobi in 1995 where he stayed up to 2001. Even when the operation, NAKI, took place in 1998, even in 1996 the Accused was in regular contact with the Prosecutor's investigators in 1996-97, the Accused met the investigators to provide them with information regarding the mode of functioning of the interim government, and this information he gave to the investigators of the Prosecutor. Naturally, in 1996-1997 investigators continued at this Tribunal; the investigations continued in Rwanda, in Belgium and in Arusha. There were cases in progress; there were reports; documents. Entire books on Rwanda were published. Judgements were rendered by the Tribunal, but none of such information, document, mentioned the name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, none of them. Third element on which we base our conviction is that there is -- there are shortcomings and inconsistencies among the Prosecution witnesses -- on the part of the Prosecution witnesses. We raised the participation -- the issue of the participation of the Accused in investigations, his cooperation with ICTR investigators in Nairobi. In 2001, the hostilities against our accused person was -- were opened. We think that those hostilities were opened by Witness CGH, and from the outset, we should bear in mind that Defence Witness DF testified that CGH had publicly stated in 2001 that he had made false statements against the Accused. We can link such assertion made by that witness before this Tribunal to the assertions made by Witness DC who asserted that he was offered $50 in order to testify against the Accused. What a method, Mr. President, Your Honours, what a method when it comes to investigation? CGH is the witness who claimed that he survived the massacres at the Gatwaro stadium in April 1994. But today we know that -- in view of his own statements before members of the Rwandan police force and the Rwandan public prosecutor, we now know that nothing of that kind happened. During their testimonies before the Tribunal, Witnesses CGE, CGX and CGB admitted that they were recruited by CGH, who himself had gave -- had given a written statement to the investigators of the Prosecutor. CGX is the mother of CGE. CGS is the brother-in-law of CGF. So, as we can see, this is a family affair. Another group of witnesses testified against the Accused with regard to events which took place in Gitwa, in Gitesi commune; those were witnesses CGN, CGY and CGV. To that group, I'd like to add CGM, who testified in respect of the subject of the alleged presence of Ndindabahizi at the roadblock at the Nyabahanga bridge during their testimonies before the Court. The four witnesses showed that they did not know the Accused and that they had never known him prior to that; therefore, they could not have identified him in 1994. Witnesses CGN, CGV and CGM asserted they knew Ndindabahizi as being a manager of the TRAFIPRO store in Kibuye. They insisted on the fact that Ndindabahizi was permanently at the TRAFIPRO office in Kibuye and that he was the manager of the store. In any event, they said that he was there at all times and that they knew him at that store in the 1980s. With exhibit to support the case provided by TRAFIPRO which did not -- which was not contested by the Prosecutor, Ndindabahizi managed to show to this Court that he never worked at the TRAFIPRO Kibuye, store. Witnesses called by the Prosecution -- this is the Defence opinion and I'm sure this is your opinion, too, Your Honours. The Prosecution witnesses consulted one another in order to identify a person whom they did not know. With regard to CGY, whom I mentioned earlier, his case was worse because it claims that he knew the Accused because he had met him 25 years earlier in a school. The last group of Prosecution witnesses is made up of two people; namely, CGK, who claimed he had spent 15 days five metres away from a roadblock, permanently manned by a significant group of Interahamwe, in Fayer in May 1994. We also have Witness CGC, who is extraordinary because he is a Tutsi, but who is being charged with genocide and he is detained in a prison because of the accusations made against him. Before moving on to another subject, I would like to take note of the fact that almost all Prosecution witnesses said that investigators of the Tribunal noted -- did not write properly their statements during investigation. This is the case, in particular, of Witnesses CGH, CGL, CGC, CGF, CGY, CGK, CGE, CGB and CGX. The investigators of the Tribunal maybe didn't do their job properly, Mr. President; but can one blame the Defence, which -- the Defence has to cross-check and verify the statements of the witnesses and, at the very least, ensure that there is consistency between written statement and oral testimony. Can you blame the Defence for the bad work done by the investigators of the Tribunal, or can we, as we do, believe that this is a method which has been used by the investigators in order to try and sort out for a long time their contradictions before this Court?Credibility of Defence witnesses: the Defence called 16 witnesses of facts. You will recall, Mr. President, Your Honours, that amongst those Defence witnesses, five of them were Tutsis and were genocide survivors; three other witnesses were Hutu, and were guilty of having participated in the genocide, have been convicted and detained in prisons in Rwanda; two witnesses were also detained in Rwanda, but those witnesses had -- have pleaded not guilty. Witness DP was an alibi witness. Witness DA was none other but the daughter of one of the victims mentioned in the indictment. As to Witness DF, he brought -- he brought into question the credibility of one of the Prosecutor's witnesses. Finally, Witnesses DL, DV and DB were Hutus that were eyewitnesses of the events in which the Accused was alleged to have been involved in. Our seventeenth witness, Witness DQ, is a Tutsi who was a genocide victim who had come to testify about the character of the Accused and who had come to talk about his visits to genocide sites immediately after the events took place; he came to testify that no one at the time felt that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was involved in those events. The Defence also called an expert witness, Professor Lugan, and as well as the Accused himself. Madam President <stage>(sic),</stage> Your Honours, during your deliberations I hope that you will recall when assessing the credibility of our witnesses that two Defence witnesses, Witnesses DN and DQ, had testified for the Prosecution in other files -- in other cases, that have come before the ICTR. Notably, Witness DN had been considered so credible by the Tribunal in the Niyitegeka case that the prosecutor congratulated him at -- during -- in court and said, "Please refer to the Niyitegeka judgement because the Court felt that you were more credible than even an expert." And after reminding this -- you of this incident, I would like to tell you that in the closing brief the Prosecutor concluded by saying that Witness DN gave false testimony. In fact, all of the witnesses have a direct -- all of the Defence witnesses have a direct link with what -- with the events that took place. And it is also true that the persons who were there when the events took place, or who know -- because these are persons who have a detailed knowledge of events that took place at the time. As to the events in Gasharu, four witnesses lived in the cellule in 1994. Four witnesses were close relatives of the victims of acts attributed to the Accused. One -- two of the witness as are, the son and the daughter of a victim, and the Accused has been accused of having killed this person. The Defence would like to respectfully submit that these witnesses must be considered extraordinarily credible. You will also have to weigh the testimony of <stage>(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).</stage> With respect to these persons, it goes without saying, Madam President <stage>(sic),</stage> Your Honours, that they had a particularly good reason to look into the identity of the person who killed their parents and the events that took place in Gasharu. Mr. President, am I going too fast?</p>

          <p>The Defence would like to ask the Trial Chamber to take note of the fact that testimony coming from Tutsis, and from persons who were related to the victims, have a higher probative value than other witnesses when they spoke in favour of the Accused. One cannot find any reason whatsoever that might push someone to come and testify for someone who might be responsible for the death of his mother or father, regardless of the circumstances. What can lead <stage>(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal)</stage> to come and testify in Ndindabahizi's favour if he had any doubt whatsoever that <stage>(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal)</stage> in the death of <stage>(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal)</stage> ? Money, most likely; that would be impossible. Similarly, testimony given by the killers, those who appeared before the Trial Chamber and who have pleaded guilty before Rwandan authorities, are very credible. Indeed, these detainees have already spoken the whole truth and they have testified; they have confessed; they have been sentenced; they have been convicted to life imprisonment. What do they have to lose by coming to testify for Ndindabahizi -- or what do they have to lose? But, more importantly, what do they have to win? Mr. President, Your Honours, do you think that coming to testify today for a former member of the interim government might improve the conditions of detention? I don't think so. Moreover, the testimony of these detained witnesses are all corroborated by the other witnesses who were eyewitnesses to the events. Finally, the Defence called on Professor Lugan and, in the Defence's view, he was very useful in bringing to light the conditions in which the interim government had been formed and to show in which manner, ultimately, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was hostage of this government, rather than being a servant of this government. These -- not that I have dealt with these preliminary matters -- I would now like to draw your attention, Madam President <stage>(sic),</stage> Your Honours, to the legal issues raised by the indictment.</p>

        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Yes, Mr. President, this will come up subsequently. Initially, I wanted to deal with more general matters, but we shall go into these matters in details in the minutes that follow. With your leave, I would now like to deal with the legal issues that -- there are two of them. I'm going to go fast, specifically with the first one which is a concurrence of crimes. And in our motions and in our closing brief, we have already dealt with this matter. In its decision of the 20th -- or, rather, the 30th of May 2002, the Trial Chamber was of the view that the trial Judge -- that is you, Madam President <stage>(sic)</stage> and Your Honours -- should deal with this. I think that the Trial Chamber was right in taking this decision at the time because now we can pay more attention to the facts that, in fact, underlie this concurrence of crimes. The Trial Chamber is in a better position to verify that the Prosecutor used exactly the same elements, the same evidence, to prove genocide and crime against humanity. The murders that are being indirectly attributed to Ndindabahizi and, specifically, that of Mukandabana and Karegeya, are presented cumulatively to support genocide and crimes against humanity, murder; moreover, the events in Gitwa are cumulatively presented to support genocide and crimes against humanity, extermination. In that case, we submit that what we have is the same set of acts constituting several offences and so, basically what we have -- the Defence submits is that we have one set of evidence that is being used to qualify several crimes. The elements constituting these three offences are identical: first degree murder which is required -- murder with premeditation, which is required to qualify the crime of genocide, is being mixed up with extermination and murder. The specific intent that is required in both cases is exactly the same. In one case and in the other, what was being prosecuted, is the destruction or the extermination of an ethnic group. With respect to the interest that society must protect, they are exactly the same; the victims are the same. They are the members of the Tutsi population and, more specifically, the members of the Tutsi population in Kibuye and, even more specifically, the Tutsi population of Gitesi and, even more specifically, individuals who have been named. And, finally, the elements used by the Prosecutor for these three offences are identical; the same witnesses appeared in each case. Mr. President, Madam -- Your Honours, this will come as no surprise to you that I am using the only judgement at the ICTR that deals with that, and that is the Kayishema-Ruzindana -- the Kayishema-Ruzindana judgement stated: "It is only acceptable to convict an accused of two or more offences in relation to the same set of facts in the following circumstances: No. 1, where offences have differing elements; or, No. 2, were the laws in question protect deferring social interests". We do not have the decision of the Appeals Chamber. I know what I am talking about because I was Defence counsel at the time and the Prosecutor was -- the appeal was dismissed, and the Appeals Chamber was not given the opportunity to stature on this. I know that there is case law on both sides, but I believe that in the Kayishema-Ruzindana case, the Tribunal -- the Trial Chamber analysed perfectly well the legal consequences of these events, and that is why I am using that case law as a reference, and the additional explanations that I provided in my closing brief to ask the Tribunal -- to ask the Trial Chamber, rather, that, in fact, genocide included crimes against humanity and that the Accused, therefore, cannot be convicted twice for the same facts. There is a defect in the indictments that, as far as I'm concerned, is even more serious than that of the one I have just mentioned, and that is the vagueness of the indictment. The indictment, even in its formal form, or is it final? Really -- I mean, last night the Prosecutor sought to amend the indictment further. Not only is the indictment vague, lacking in precision, but it has errors with respect to acts that are being attributed to the Accused. And, more specifically, the indictment is, generally speaking, vague, which causes prejudice to the Accused. In the description of the facts, the Prosecutor mentions various events that took place in May, or around that date, or around the end of May, or during the months of April, May and June 1994. Another circumstance: the Accused -- the manner in which the Accused is alleged to have participated in the event is vague and fully defined in paragraphs 15 and 20 of the indictment. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi is accused of having being in charge of a series of attacks; he lead or participated; he -- either he discharged the firearm or directed attackers. We don't know if the Accused actually was an accomplice, whether he incited, whether he supervised or whether he actually executed those acts. In paragraph 13 of the indictment, the Prosecutor alleges that, in late May 1994 in Kayenzi secteur at or near Fayer, Ndindabahizi supervised attacks upon the Tutsi, or participated in the attacks. And then in his final closing arguments, these events that, in fact, are described only by Witness CGK, are suddenly moved to Gitaka; they no longer took place in Fayer. And in the closing arguments that we heard last night, in another miraculous manner, the site of Fayer reappears as an autonomous element of an offence. You will recall, Madam President <stage>(sic),</stage> Your Honours, that in any case the Prosecutor failed to prove that these acts took place. Because, regardless of the circumstances, the question is not -- he did not supervise the attacks or, at the very best, he might have giving a speech. Let us refer to paragraph 14 with respect to Karongi hill which should no longer exist. And then what should be say about paragraph 16 of the indictment in which Ndindabahizi is accused of having -- throwing an explosive grenade on Gitwa on the 14th of April, on that date or about that date? Whereas the Prosecutor announces in the hearing that actually these events took place around the 17th, perhaps the 18th, or the 19th, or the 20th but, in any case, between the 17th and the 20th of April. Finally, paragraph 11 of the indictment was so vague that it was the Defence who was able to identify the victim who appeared in the indictment. First of all, this is a man of mixed race and, in the words of the witness -- this is a man whose name is Nturuso and, ultimately, it was the Defence, by bringing <stage>(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).</stage> And I should like to add to that: as Nors was not a Tutsi, we do not see how this paragraph in the indictment would be relevant with respect to the crime of genocide that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi stands accused of. I would like to come to an end of this seemingly endless list by referring to paragraph 25 of the indictment that, again, is not supported by any evidence. During mid-April 1994 Emmanuel Ndindabahizi instigated an order by the persons at a roadblock; which persons, which roadblock? This indictment is a list of vague and imprecise accusations that cannot be used in proper form and cannot serve as the basis of a conviction. In law, the Defence submits that this indictment does not follow -- or does not abide by Rule 47 <stage>(C)</stage> of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Most recent case law by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda confirmed this. The Semanza judgement which was rendered on -- in May 2003, says that, "As the primary accusatory instrument, an indictment must contain a concise statement of the facts dealing with the crime or crimes with which an accused is charged. The Accused also has a right to be promptly informed in detail of the nature of the charges against him." Still, I will read further from Semanza: "The fundamental question in determining whether an indictment was pleaded with sufficient particularity is whether an accused had enough detail to prepare his defence"; "Whether an accused had enough detail to prepare his defence", and that is the important part of the sentence. It is under the Rules seeking to protect the defence that the judges must take into consideration when they're going to look at the indictment and determine whether it is vague or whether it was specific or not. But the Defence firmly submits that, in the instant case, the rights of the Defence were infringed upon, more specifically, with preparing the -- an alibi defence; more specifically, when they came to investigate specific events that should have been described in an indictment which should be the backbone of the Prosecutor's case. Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to remind you that Trial Chamber II of the ICTR on the 25th of February 2004 gave an order, and in paragraph 32 of this decision it is said that, "When the prosecutor submits that an accused was involved in crimes, then the indictments must provide details of the identity of the victims, including the places, the dates in which these crimes were committed."</p>

If the victims cannot be individually identified, at least you should give us their position within a group. Finally, the Ntagerura judgement states that, "When the prosecutor cannot provide additional details than those provided in the indictment, then the indictment should clearly indicate that that is the best information available to the defence." </p>

          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>The violations of the rights of the Accused do not stop there when it comes to the drafting of the indictment. In fact, in paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 26 and 28 of the indictment -- let me repeat because I made a mistake. In paragraphs 6, 7, 26 and 28 of the amended indictment mention is made of the death of a teacher called Tatiane Nyiramaritete. The death occurred in the cellule of the Accused; that is, the Gasharu cellule and not the Gisharu cellule as the indictment sets out. In paragraphs 8, 9, 27 and 28 of the indictment, mention is made of a man called Mukantabana also in Gasharu where it is alleged -- where it is mentioned that he was killed. And this is absolutely unbelievable, Mr. President, Your Honours. The Prosecutor had to wait for the case in court and the testimony of CGB in order to realise that, in reality, Nyiramaritete and Mukantabana were one and the same person; that Mukantabana was not a man but, rather, Mukantabana was a -- Nyiramaritete was the nickname of Mukantabana. And this is confirmed by the Prosecutor; that is, Nyiramaritete was the nickname of Mukantabana. But we don't know what was the origin of this mistake. We did not hear from the Prosecutor any explanation regarding the consequences of this mistake. The Prosecutor, it's true, yesterday said Nyiramaritete, Mukantabana were one and the same person. It's obvious that the indictment does not reflect reality; therefore, we withdraw a part of the indictment." But will the Court accept such an explanation? We can say that, "Oh, look, Prosecutor, you've committed sins and you've accused Ndindabahizi of the deaths of Nyiramaritete, Mukantabana, but then we forgive you." Today, Nyiramaritete is no longer Tatiane, but we are told now this is Helen; this is again a third name which just pops up out of nothing. In truth, Mr. President, the consequences of this mistake are considerable for the Defence because, as if to further mislead the Defence team, Mukantabana and Nyiramaritete were killed on two different dates; the first on the 9th of April 1994, and the second in May 1994. Therefore, the Defence should start from the outset to carry out its investigations on totally erroneous premises. And, once again, this should actually deepen the pitfall on the part of the Defence because the indictment does not end there as far as errors are made. All the dates given to the Defence in the indictment are false. </p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>Yesterday the Prosecution withdrew paragraphs 6 and 7 and said that they are now relying on paragraph 8 of the indictment. Now, in paragraph 8 there is the reference to the two men known as Karegeya and Mukantabana. So what is the position of the Defence now, based on the fact that it is paragraph 8 of the indictment which is still being maintained by the Prosecutor? Can I just have your comment on that, please? </p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>I have two answers to that question, Mr. President. My first answer is that it's too late. The mistake corrected yesterday in this Court by the Prosecutor has already created consequences and has -- is prejudicial to the Defence, so the Defence could not carry out in its investigations on specific elements regarding the death of two different people. It's too late. The prejudice caused to the Defence is that -- the Defence was not allowed to take advantage of having investigations and find a possible defence of alibi, as we would have liked. Secondly, I think that paragraph 8 of the indictment as maintained is not more acceptable as presented as paragraph 6 and 7, because in this paragraph 8 we have the following words: "Emmanuel Ndindabahizi thanked the people, who were present, for their efforts, but warned them that two men known as Karegeya and Mukantabana were still alive." And if you look at the beginning of paragraph 8, the date of the event is in early May 1994; yet, all the Prosecution witnesses who came here, as well as the Prosecutor himself yesterday, said that this was at the end of May 1994. Now, on the basis of the witness statements, on the investigations on the ground, was the Defence able to verify that at the beginning of May in 1994 -- were murdered? If -- this would have allowed us to have equality of arms and respond to the Prosecutor's allegations, and this was not the case. We think that this paragraph still has all the shortcomings mentioned. And another comment I'd like to make before to this Court concerning some legal issues: I'd like to draw, firstly, the attention of the Court to the fact that the mistake related to the confusion of people comes on top of the mistake related to dates in the indictment, and this is very serious as far as the situation is concerned. Prosecution witnesses obviously mentioned facts which resemble those mentioned in the indictment, but which are not really identical, and at any rate, those events took place on dates which are far from the dates mentioned in the indictment; for example, Witness CGF testified to the events which occurred, according to his oral testimony, at the end of May 1994, but the indictment situates the events on the 9th and 10th of April 1994. Witnesses CGB, CGX and CGE testified on events which occurred at the end of May 1994, according to their oral testimony, but those events in the indictment, particularly in paragraph 8, are placed at the beginning of the month of May. Same thing applies to the events in Gitwa whereby the indictment situates such events between the 13th and the 26th of April, 1994 on the one hand, and on the 14th of April 1994, on the other hand. However, according to testimonies before this Court, those events actually took place between the 20th and 25th of April 1994. The Defence was not -- could not have been informed of the serious mistakes before these testimonies of the witnesses because their written statements confirmed the dates mentioned in the indictment, and this is prejudicial to the Defence. It's only during the testimony of the witnesses before the Court that the Defence realised the dates did not tally with the dates mentioned in the indictment, and at that time it was too late to conduct investigations because investigations were over. The Defence, therefore, submits that it is particularly unfair to mislead the Accused in respect of dates of events by amending, during the trial, testimony in favour of Prosecution witnesses. The Accused cannot start all over again the preparation of his trial when witnesses come here to testify for the Prosecution. On a legal level, the situation is a bit special because it's different from the situation prevailing in Tadic at ICTY and Kayishema-Ruzindana at ICTR in 1999. At that time, the Prosecution was blamed for providing allegations which were too vague but, here, it's the opposite. There was specificity -- there was <stage>(undecipherable)</stage> specificity and a lot of errors which mislead the Defence. However, there are some legal elements which have to be taken into account in order to take into account this fact. I think that the Appeals Chamber had the last word in the Kupreskic case because the Appeals Chamber on the 23rd of October 2001 ruled that, "A decisive factor in determining the degree of specificity with which the Prosecution is required to particularise the facts of its case in the indictment is the nature of the alleged criminal conduct charged to the accused; for example, in a case where the prosecution alleges that an accused personally committed a criminal act, the material facts, such as the identity of the victim, the time and place of the events, and the means by which the acts were committed have to be pleaded in detail. The Appeals Chamber continued. </p>

        <sp who="#mr-president">
          <speaker>MR. PRESIDENT:</speaker>
          <p>We have, of course, paragraph 82 in front of us, so we will read paragraph 82. We note that you have quoted these two elements in your brief and we are aware of that. May I ask you, because now I notice that you are on the point of leading the legal issues in the indictment: quite frequently in your brief you refer to the indictment of 20th August 2003, but there is no dispute that they are talking about the one of 1st September, of course, in the latest version, just for the record.</p>
        </sp>
        <sp who="#mr-besnier">
          <speaker>MR. BESNIER:</speaker>
          <p>Yes, Mr. President. Yes, Mr. President. It's simply a technical issue of technical modification, but the comments are valid for both cases. And, indeed, Mr. President, I'll conclude with the legal matter to highlight the significant consequences which the Appeals Chamber placed on the indictment. And if an indictment is vitiated in such a manner, then the Court may annul a verdict of -- may reverse a conviction. We're not leaving totally legal matters, Mr. President, because now I'd like to talk about what the Prosecutor called in his closing arguments "contextual questions". This is, in a way, the third legal issue. I don't know whether this is a legal issue, as such, because we have to put a name on this strange paragraph, on this unidentified object, which the Prosecutor calls contextual matters -- he calls, in his brief, the "general context" under which crimes are committed. Is he talking about the social political context of Rwanda? No. Is he talking about specific context regarding the Accused; that is, some elements of biographic natures as well as allegations related to the presence of the Accused in the government? What is legal nature of the section of the Prosecution's brief titled "General Context"? Is it as the Prosecutor said, intended to define the mens rea? I mean, not because the elements presented by the Prosecutor are not linked to the charges against the Accused but, rather, it talks about different elements, like the meeting of 3rd of May in Kibuye. Moreover, we know that mens rea in genocide is different from mens rea in crimes against humanity. And in the Prosecution's closing brief there is no distinction between the two. Therefore, is it something to do with the consistent pattern of conduct pursuant under Rule 93 <stage>(A)</stage> the Rules of Procedure? The Prosecutor doesn't say so. It is not acceptable for the Prosecution to refer to 93 of the Rules in order to have admitted a significant amount of information which has nothing at all to do with facts, and without giving the Accused the chance of defending himself, and of carrying out investigations on those specific points. I think that this is an issue which should be ruled upon by the Court because Rule 93 always poses problems for defence teams. Firstly, there are problems going beyond the limits of Rule 93 <stage>(A),</stage> and I don't know of any decision which has dealt with this issue. We also need to know the amount of information that can be brought into evidence pursuant to Rule 93 <stage>(A)</stage> and what amount of information can actually be linked to the information contained in the indictment. I'll even, myself, say that the Defence -- as far as this contextual element, as far as we're concerned, this is an ULO -- an unidentified legal object -- because it presents in the Prosecution's closing arguments more voluminous documentation than the presentation of evidence; that is, 23 pages against 30. So what is in this part of the closing arguments is that the Prosecutor omitted the acts mentioned in the 2001 indictment, and he's using the back door. The meeting of 3rd May was in the June 2001 indictment. The participation of the Accused in the government is in the indictment of 2001, so much so that today we can ask the question: why did the Prosecutor amend his initial indictment and why during trial he did not file a motion seeking a new amendment to the indictment? Now, given to over-hesitation in this case between individual responsibility and command responsibility, the Prosecutor has failed in the final analysis to prove either; yet the Prosecutor had the necessary time to conduct its investigations, and when the Prosecutor and its teams were talking with the Accused in 1996 and in 1997, there were teams on the ground carrying out investigations in order to prepare for five trials which -- whose setting are the Kibuye préfecture, and these are the trials of Kayishema, Musema, Niyitegeka, Ntakirutimana, father and son; and the trial of Mr. Bagilishema as well. Mr. President, Your Honours, and particularly you, Your Honours, the two lady Judges, because Mr. President took part in some of the decisions which I have mentioned, but I have to inform you that between 1997 and 2003 there were 209 people who testified before ICTR to speak to the massacres against Tutsis which took place between April and July 1994, before this Tribunal. One hundred and twenty-five people appeared for the Prosecution; whereas, 84 people appeared for the Defence as Defence witnesses. The Defence looked at each of those testimonies, read each of the judgements. The name of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi does not appear anywhere in the testimonies of those 209 people and in judgements relating to crimes committed in Kibuye, whereas, other names including names of people of a lower station in life than Ndindabahizi -- small traders; small cell leaders; minor cell leaders -- are mentioned; their names are mentioned in those testimonies and judgements. How can one explain that the Prosecutor in 2001, all of a sudden, remembered that Ndindabahizi was an instigator of genocide committed in Kibuye? Why didn't the Prosecutor think about Ndindabahizi in 1996 and 1997 when they had him, when they took tea together in a hotel in Nairobi? Ndindabahizi explained in his testimony before the Tribunal how the Prosecutor contacted him and how the contacts were eventually ended. Why didn't the Prosecutor take that opportunity to conduct investigations against a former minister in the interim government? How did the Prosecutor not find at that time witnesses; whereas, in June 2001 the Prosecutor, all of a sudden, found all those witnesses? During all those years the Tribunal had a complete document and dossiers which were reliable, tendered by -- tendered in the court. This is the preliminary report of the identification of sites of genocide committed in April to July 1994. That document was tendered -- I don't remember its name -- but it was -- my systems will find it, but that document is dated February 1996, and it is an important evidence for Ndindabahizi's defence because he's accused of having been involved in the massacres and murders of Tutsis in Gitesi commune. The information contained in the document on the Gitesi commune, in particular, clearly show that the name of the Accused does not appear either among the perpetrators or the masterminds of the genocide in that area. The name of a minister who is alleged to have taken part in such crimes -- I mean, his name, would it really have escaped the people who had drafted the document? And I have to tell you, the person who wrote that document, Ignace Bayaga is a native of the commune from where Ndindabahizi comes, so, he must -- he should have known that such an important person, if that was the case, had been involved in the events. Now, along those lines, and I'll conclude, we have to remember the testimony of DQ. DQ testified before this Chamber on the 6th of November 2003. He's a special witness because he's a Tutsi and he lost his entire family during the genocide; his wife and four children. He remained in Rwanda up to 2000. He knows Ndindabahizi because he worked with him at the ministry of planning in Kigali. He undertook several missions after the genocide, in 1995, within the context of reburial of bodies. He was involved in the burial of Tutsis in that area who had been massacred in 1994. And on those missions, when he was a member of parliament, he interviewed members of the population. And we asked him, "Did you ever have any information regarding the responsibility of Emmanuel Ndindabahizi as an instigator during the genocide?", and the answer is no. Unless you are talking about the indictment, no mention was made of Ndindabahizi. And this man lost his entire family. He conducted the investigations himself in 1995. He did not find the slightest trace of the presence of the Accused during the massacres at that place, at that time. And I have to say that that particular person testified for the prosecution against Musema in 1999. This is what we call the real contextual elements. In summary and to conclude, the contextual elements are in favour of the Accused rather than the opposite, but the Prosecutor has refused to see so. And, Mr. President, before concluding, I'll very briefly like to make two comments because I have to answer two accusations made by the Prosecutor, but I'll be very brief on these points because it is in our brief, and this involves the meeting of 3rd May in Kibuye and the participation of Ndindabahizi in the interim government. I just want to illustrate two points of view which are actually two points of view of the Tribunal Chambers. With regard to the participation of the interim government, I would like to simply underline that in the Bagilishema case the Tribunal underlined the fact that a person found to have knowingly been part of an organisation with criminal objectives will not necessarily incur responsibility; the person must have positively participated in the groups' crimes by substantially contributing to the crimes, or by influencing the course of related events. But, in this case, the Prosecutor never showed that Ndindabahizi had any influence over the course of the events in Rwanda. I will not go further on this point, Mr. President. We have dealt with this issue at length in our brief. With regard to the meeting of 3rd of May in Kibuye, I believe that we should recall, simply, that firstly the document on which the Prosecutor relies -- that is, the so-called transcript of that meeting in Kibuye -- is contested, challenged by the Defence because this is a document which was written well after the meeting had taken place. We have no indication regarding the source or related to the drafting of that document. When the only factual witness who attended that meeting was examined -- that was GKH -- when he was examined, he said he didn't remember whether the Accused had spoken at the meeting or, in any event, what he might have said. And on this point, I'll briefly conclude, Mr. President, by saying that the meeting of 3rd May is not in the indictment, and the Accused participated at that meeting because the prime minister asked him to attend the meeting and if, indeed, he spoke at that meeting, no one speaks what he said at that meeting. Last point, because I see that I'm short of time: we would like to raise the issue of elements in the indictment and witnesses regarding Gitwa, Nyabahanga, Gisharu, and this is the defence of alibi. And, once again, I'd like to shorten my explanation in this regard. I'd like to underline that the errors made by the Prosecution in the indictment, the false information provided in the indictment, have had a negative influence on the search for alibi by the Accused. We did not look for alibi regarding certain dates because those dates are not included in the indictment and we concentrated on the dates which are mentioned in the indictment. Therefore, we found an alibi which was obvious concerning the period covering the 8th and the 9th of April 1994 because it was at that time that the Accused was a member of the government and had been sworn in -- and was sworn in. We also produced an alibi which was not challenged covering the 11th to the 18th of May 1994 when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi. I'll pause here briefly, Mr. President, on this point because the period 11 to 18 May 1994 is not an innocent period, if I dare say so; this was the time when the more serious crimes were committed in the Kibuye préfecture, particularly in Bisesero. That is when a vast majority, not to say almost every Tutsi in Kibuye was massacred at Bisesero hills. If we were to refer to the Musema judgement, as well as the Kayishema-Ruzindana judgements, then we note that the dates of 13th and 14th May are bloody dates in the history of Kibuye. </p>

          <p>Tutsis of Kibuye, who had escaped massacres at the stadium on the 18th of April and those who had escaped massacres at Home Saint-Jean, gathered at Bisesero hill named Gitwa -- at the Bisesero hills named Gitwa, and Muyira. And on the 13th and the 14th of May an extraordinary, large attack was launched against the civilians who had sought refuge there. Numerous testimonies testified to that. Tens of thousands of people -- men, women, elderly and children -- were exterminated in the course of that attack. All authorities who participated in those massacres were there. And when you look at the judgement, you have the préfet, but you also have other personalities, but it's not up to me to reveal their names because their cases are still ongoing. But no witnesses in that regard mentioned Ndindabahizi's name. If Ndindabahizi had been an instigator of certain killings carried out in Kibuye, he would be there, no doubt, on the 13th and 14th at the Muyira hill.The alibi covering the 12th, 13th and 14th of April 1994 was supported by Defence Witness DP. Very briefly, I would like to recall that DP worked with Emmanuel Ndindabahizi at the ministry of finance. Witness DP spoke not only to the 12th, 13th and 14th of April 1994, but he also testified to the period -- the subsequent period; that is, the rest of May. And he also drew up a chart of Ndindabahizi's professional life and presence. So I think we have to look at his testimony in a consistent manner. He described a man who was amidst torment and chaos in the events of 1994 who, in spite of himself, was appointed the minister of finance in the interim government. He worked as best as he could to, at least on the surface, make sure that the finances of the state worked; to see to it that civil servants were paid; to see to it that supplies got to where they were needed, and that witness, Mr. President, Your Honours, described all that. And if you look at DP's testimony closely, he described the day-to-day activities of Ndindabahizi. Of course, he did not see him for every second of every day, but he would see him at least every day twice because he would be at his office signing documents; he was trying to see how best he could deal with finances in view of the chaos that englobed Rwanda in April and May 1994.In an attempt to minimise the testimony of Witness DP, the Prosecutor seeks to insinuate that in its closing brief he is related to the Accused. This is speculation that was not supported by any evidence whatsoever. The witness was asked, and he answered perfectly clearly, that he was not related in any way to Witness DP and that, in fact, he had been taken -- swept away by the events of 1994 and, somewhat despite himself, he had had to cooperate with the government.In conclusion, I believe that this witness was sufficiently credible and well informed of the activities of the Accused so that his testimony would make it highly improbable that he -- that the Accused participated in any way in the massacres that took place in Kibuye between April and June 1994.Mr. President, Your Honours, I am now coming to an end. Emmanuel Ndindabahizi's alibi defence must be upheld not only because of the fact that it is reliable but, more specifically, because of the manner in which the rights of the Defence were infringed upon because of acts committed by the Prosecutor and because the Defence was not able to present in a timely manner an alibi defence that would have answered specifically the charges brought against the Accused.We are not afraid to face those charges today, but in somewhat brief manner.And now Counsel Marçais is going to go over the events that took place between April and June 1994 in Kibuye préfecture.</p>

          <p>Mr. President, Your Honours, as Pascal Besnier said in his opening words, deep in our heart we have a belief, and this belief, this certainty, is one that we would like to share with you. You will have understood what this belief, what this certainty, is, and that is that when Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi working with the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor saw -- the situation turned against him and in just a few months, in an artificial manner, a case was prepared that we now have to deal with today. Everywhere we went, including at the detention facilities -- this may seem somewhat paradoxical, because in European prisons counsel can usually only meet with their own clients -- we were told that, "It was a political case; Ndindabahizi is the most innocent amongst us but, you know, it will be difficult for you to deal with the Tribunal". But we feel full of confidence because we know that the ICTR is an independent Tribunal and that you will apply virtue in the Roman sense of it, that is, courage when faced with these accusations; we know that you will be able to sift through them and find the truth and choose acquittal.We are convinced that our witnesses are credible. We want to be credible, and we even dare to think that the Trial Chamber will be even more credible in the eyes of the world, not necessarily in the eyes of Rwanda because we know the pressures take there, but in the eyes of the world you will be credible and will be prepared to acquit Mr. Ndindabahizi.This is a somewhat unusual trial for an international tribunal. When I arrived here at the request of Counsel Pascal Besnier I thought of the international tribunal in Nuremberg, of this tremendous trial that lasted a year, of those organisers of those terrible crimes in the genocide in Europe between '39 and '45. But, here, I have a case of a single man who is accused of having participated in specific events. And the accusations made against him may seem somewhat unusual. And in these individual desire -- acts in that we don't know that there were individual acts, that is, it was inciting because he was a minister of the government; or whether it was just incitement, instigation, that we don't really understand. The question that you have to deal with, Mr. President and Your Honours, is within this time when the devil was stronger than God, when violence dealt with the sacred, and where 800,000 Tutsis were massacred in the genocide. But we should also like to say that 200,000 Hutu were also killed in the fighting with the RPF and, as they went through Rwanda and the former Zaire. But the question is: did they really need this man, this small man to galvanise the population even though he was the former minister for finance and do we really need this man to distribute machetes?I would now like to deal more with this point. When we speak of the charges against Ndindabahizi in Rwanda in this terrible context -- sometimes smile when they hear of this. And it is necessary to distribute machetes? So the first point is that they are trying to make us believe that in this case fabricated by the Office of the Prosecutor at the end of the year 2000 that Ndindabahizi, the minister of finance, was not busy in his office in Gitarama in this government, that Professor Lugan considered this government similar to the fall of Saigon, than a strong government, that in his description at the end of this regime he described it as a distraction, some form of amusement. He would take that car; he would get a few Interahamwe to accompany him and then he would go off to the roadblocks where he would encourage people to kill Tutsis, including the women -- female Tutsis who had married Hutus. Judge Khan was saying -- reminded us yesterday that the origins, the ethnic origins of the wife of -- Mr. Ndindabahizi's wife, even though she has a Hutu identity card -- or she is of Tutsi parentage.I would like to ask you to refer to the testimony of <stage>(By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal)</stage> that he, quite frankly, had different things to deal with. I don't want to read too much because we will not have enough time, and I would still like to give the floor to my learned friend Counsel Pascal Besnier who will deal with the conclusion and the events that took place in Gasharu, because I was going to deal with all the other events because -- but because they were very widely described in the Defence's brief, the Trial Chamber will accept that I sometimes go very fast and cover these matters briefly.Now, do people really need machetes to kill? I mean, who are they -- who are we dealing with? Other witnesses, including Prosecution witnesses, like Witness DF, on page 35 of the French version of the 7th <stage>(sic)</stage> of November 2003: "Can you tell us --"</p>

          <p>Question, page 35, Wednesday, 7 <stage>(sic)</stage> November 2003 of the French transcript, the question is put to Witness DF, and you will likely recall this is a man, a priest, and he was asked: "Can you tell us whether you heard of any machetes being distributed at the Kibirizi market?"Answer: "Distribution? Who would have distributed them? I did not hear of any distribution. I am a bit surprised by this distribution -- this alleged distribution, and this is my sociological comment, because in Rwanda each peasant has a machete. This is an agricultural implement that we use to chop down banana trees, to cut down branches, or to go and collect firewood. This is an agricultural tool that we have at home, normally speaking; therefore, I do not see how or why anybody would go around distributing machetes to people who already have them at home."If you were to allow me to, I would say that it was almost as if I went to a building site and sought to distribute construction material or to try and give a pair of scissors to a seamstress; I mean, whose leg are they seeking to pull?When Witness DC came to testify, what does this witness say: "We had traditional weapons." You must understand what Witness DC means: "Some hard machetes; others had clubs, but only one person had a firearm". That is, again, the transcript of November 3rd, 2003.Let us now go to the 31st of October: "Everyone had a machete at home because in Rwandan culture everyone has a machete at home, and women are not allowed to touch their husband's machete. The children are not allowed to touch the machete belonging to the wife and when a young -- the first thing a young teenager purchases is a hoe and a machete. It's -- in our culture a hoe and machete have become a sign of maturity. The first thing you do is you go and buy a hoe and a machete."Now a Prosecution witness goes to confirm this on the 9th of September, page 2, line 14 of the French transcript: "Yes, in Rwanda, regardless of whether you are a Tutsi or a Hutu, inhabitants have tools, notably machetes, but usually they are used to deal with fields."</p>

          <p>I will try, therefore, to be somewhat less Anglo-Saxon - somewhat more Anglo-Saxon and temper my Latin sensibilities. Thank you for your comment, Mr. President.In any case, I was seeking to deal -- read a testimony given by the Prosecution <stage>(sic)</stage> on the 9th of September: "Usually, in Rwanda, regardless of whether you are Tutsi or Hutu, local people have tools and, amongst others, machetes but, normally, they are used to deal with -- work in the fields."What I was seeking to say, Mr. President, Your Honours, as I was saying a moment ago, was that this was a sociological comment. The average Rwandan farmer -- and just as the Greek philosophers would say -- would have -- used syllogism the Rwandan farmer has a machete. When he is an attacker at a roadblock and goes to the roadblock he will bring his machete; therefore, he has -- does not need the minister of finance to bring him a machete. And that is the only element in the Prosecutor's indictment, with the exception of the alleged use of a grenade, that Emmanuel Ndindabahizi was never accused of having done anything else.If we look at the events that took place at the roadblock at Fayer, I would like to begin with Defence witnesses. And I will say a few words of Prosecution witnesses, but I think it will be -- we can proceed faster if we begin with Defence witnesses. Two Defence witnesses were interviewed about activities that might have taken place at the Fayer roadblock. Their testimony is in contradiction of testimony of Witness CGK. Mr. President, Your Honours, I will refer you to paragraph 949 through 950."Were there any roadblocks in Fayer?"And the answer is: "Fayer in -- the place called Fayer or the place in Gitesi?""This is actually a place that is called the small centre of Kayenzi.""That's correct."Answer: "There were no roadblocks in that place.""How do you know?" "I know it because it's on the road. The roadblock was 200 or a hundred metres afterwards in Gaseke.""Witness DC, do you know this place called Fayer?", a question was put to him.And he says, "Yes, I know the place well.""Do you know if there was a roadblock in Fayer?""No, the roadblock was slightly before; therefore, there was no roadblock in a place called Fayer. The roadblock was slightly before in Gaseke", and we shall return to that -- "in Kayenzi, and that is where the roadblock had been set up."In order to support the charge that the roadblock existed, the Prosecution brought one witness, Witness CGK, and this witness says several things. First of all, the Prosecutor explained to us that there was one element that followed; that is -- because the people had learned lessons properly -- the minister, Ndindabahizi, had a white vehicle. Unfortunately for Fayer, they say that he had a small, black car. Even though the witnesses have consulted one another, even though lessons have been taught to them, they must realise that in this case they are referring to a small black car.With respect to the second point, I remember having done that first cross-examination and on several occasions, Mr. President, you had to draw my attention to this, and I thank you for doing this. Taking into consideration the testimony of the witness, I sought to summarise what you said, because she had said, first, three weeks, then two weeks, which necessarily bought us up to mid-May, but in mid-May this date did not work for her and did not work for the Prosecutor, because we all know that in mid-May Mr. Ndindabahizi was in Nairobi. Therefore, even though the mathematical and chronological accounting meant that the events took place in mid-May, the witness decided to say, well, actually it took place at the end of May.The third point with respect to the testimony of Witness CGK which is very important, that is, the issue that comes back on many occasions in this file; that is, the identification of the witness -- or, rather, the identification of the Accused by the witness: in our closing brief we have stated that the witness can never -- without openly lying, a witness cannot seriously claim to know Ndindabahizi. The witness claims to have met Ndindabahizi at a health centre where, in fact, he did not go. She said that she only saw him on one occasion, and we believe that we have provided sufficient evidence, even though if it were up to us to provide evidence, even though the situation should be reversed where the Prosecutor should be adducing evidence, the witness cannot have recognised Ndindabahizi.Amongst these inconsistencies, when I reread the file, one of them came to light. The woman said, "I spent three weeks next to the Nyabahanga river. Then I went to five -- a place located five metres away from the roadblock. I stayed there two weeks without drinking or eating." You don't need to be a physician to realise that if you can -- although you can go without eating for several days, you cannot go without drinking for several days because your kidneys become blocked and you die. So, for this person to say that she remained for two weeks without eating or drinking is necessarily an obvious lie. And, with respect to the identification of the Accused by this witness, our closing brief closes on this, and everything shows that in the testimony of Witness CGK that she could not have known him, and this is what he had to say. She is even mistaken on the names of his father and mother, and this was a question that was put to her during her testimony.There was a second point that I would like to ask, and it deals with the Gaseke roadblock and the death of Nors. My learned friend, but nevertheless my friend, said that in this case -- in this matter of the death of Nors, the Defence had to -- was somewhat bound, because if one had sought to infringe upon the rights of Defence, one would not have proceeded otherwise. The first question that comes to mind is from a legal prospective. On the 28th of November 2003, Mr. President, when you asked Ndindabahizi were any Tutsi -- were Tutsi killed because they were Tutsis, and Ndindabahizi says yes. He agrees that there was a genocide, because that is the definition of genocide. Tutsis were killed because they were Tutsi. But Nors is not Tutsi. And we are told, "Through your distribution of machetes, you have contributed to the organisation of the genocide". But if the organisation of the genocide is to kill a Tutsi -- or, rather, a man of mixed race, the Prosecution did not fulfil its role. This is what we had to say. That is the first question that comes to mind.As Counsel Besnier said a moment ago, we have gone from a witness who was of mixed race; whereas, in the testimony of Witness CGC, a person called Nturusu -- and when our investigators go on the ground and they say the only person of mixed race who was killed was not Nturusu, but actually a person named Nors. So we bring those who will allow us to identify Nors. And in the Prosecutor's closing brief, I am absolutely amazed, astounded, with the manner in which he says "Nturusu alias Nors". I must admit that I would rather have seen it as a somewhat more convincing explanation. How we have gone from a man of mixed race whose name was Nturusu to a Tutsi named Nors is difficult. We are -- our arms are bound. I mean, we cannot -- it is very difficult for us to proceed in this manner with respect to this business with Nors, because we have finally agreed to the fact that the man of mixed race whose name was Nturusu, but actually Nors, whose relative were able to identify -- Witness CGC was the only witness who says that he saw a scene in May 1994, and he said that initially it occurred in around the 20th of May 1994, and then before the Trial Chamber he said, "Yes, this took place on the 20th of May 1994; I am certain of this". In his written statement -- it was tendered as an exhibit before the Trial Chamber -- and the witness states that on the 20th of May 1994 at the Gaseke roadblock he saw Gaseke <stage>(sic)</stage> in a white vehicle this time; stop the vehicle; get out of the vehicle and then distribute machetes.Am I going too fast? Am I going too fast, Your Honour? </p>

          <p>Witness CGC says that on the 20th May 1994 at the Gaseke roadblock saw -- the witness says that she saw Ndindabahizi who was in a white vehicle; the vehicle stopped; he got out of the vehicle and unloaded machetes and distributed moneys to the attackers so that they could drink, so that they could drink beer; and this distribution of machetes and money is the incitement to kill, incitement to kill the man of mixed race, Nors, with a vehicle driven by a person named <stage>(By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal),</stage> and this vehicle later came through the Gaseke roadblock.In this case the Defence did not just bring in Witness DA, who was <stage>(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal);</stage> we also brought another witness who is even more important and of which very little mention was made, and that is Witness DB. This is the most important witness because this witness <stage>(By order of the Court, these words have been extracted and filed under seal).</stage> This is the person who was the most direct witness of the events. And when I reread the Prosecutor's brief and when I listened to the closing arguments made by the Prosecutor, I realised that, in fact, they sought to contradict us on Witness DC and on Witness DA, but that, in fact, they had not sought to bring any light on any inconsistencies made by this witness. I cannot give the name of this witness because he is a protected witness. With respect to the Prosecution I take note of the fact that the witness waited some seven years to mention the facts -- the events that he witnessed indirectly on the 20th of May 1994. You will also recall that the statement of this witness was collected in the Kibuye guest house, and we come to the realisation that, in fact, this place has become the Prosecutor's annex, and when Counsel Besnier asked: "When you were interviewed by the investigators of the Tribunal you came to see him of your own volition, or did someone else ask you to come?""It was I who gave the statement".Next question: "How do you know that the investigators were looking for information about Ndindabahizi?""I was in the position to know because someone spoke French where I was, and I heard that they were looking for information about this person, and I told them that I knew this person."I would also like to draw your attention to the vagueness of the indictment with this respect, and I would also like to remind you that during his testimony, the statement -- the testimony, the witness said that, without any doubt, the date was the 20th of May 1994, and the witness even said, "I believe that that date is firmly engraved in my memories, my recollection". And still on this matter of the machetes, I would like to say something further. I'm not repeating what I have said earlier but, nevertheless, the distribution of bladed weapons, as opposed to firearms, to Rwandan peasants, especially when these are attackers posted at a roadblock -- Witness CGC does not question that -- the fact that the attackers were already armed.Question: "Are you saying that before Emmanuel Ndindabahizi came to the roadblock no one was armed with the exception of this person who had a spear?""That is correct", is the answer.And, finally, the most obvious, blatant inconsistency is given to the investigators in -- on the 10th of October 2000 where the witness says, "I was present at the roadblock at the time of the events"; and during the testimony to the Trial Chamber, "I explained to you that this person was killed after I had already left." That means that the person is saying something at the complete opposite of the statement."I don't know how the investigators were able to write my statement in that manner. But, in any case, I was already gone when this person was killed." Very often, when inconsistency comes to light between the witness statement and the oral testimony before the Court, the witness will say, "It is the fault of the investigators of the Prosecutor who did not properly take down my statement". I was somewhat surprised by this. I must admit that I thought to myself that the investigators, in general, including those of the Prosecutor, must carefully note what is being said by the witness, and that actually it is the witnesses who are changing their view -- the position of the events -- their view of the events.Madam President <stage>(sic),</stage> Your Honours, I was the -- the witness said that he was present on the 10th of November 2000, and then he says, "I have explained to you that this person was killed after I had left", in their <stage>(sic)</stage> testimony. And this was confirmed by Counsel Besnier: "The man of mixed race named Nors, is this the person named; Nturusu and Nors are one and the same person?""Yes, they are.""But today you admit that you said you did not witness the killing, whereas, you told the investigators of the Tribunal otherwise?"And he said, "Look, I think the investigators made a mistake."Here, too, on this point, there's a problem of the acknowledgment by the Accused but, in particular, there is total inconsistency from the people who know about the death of Nors, and earlier mentioned the driver. You will remember, obviously, that the driver -- he was a small man -- it was said that he left Kibuye; he met Nors and went to Rubengera to buy fuel for his vehicle, and on the way he met Nors and that, although Nors was still sick, he wanted to go back to work and, therefore, Nors got into the car and goes towards Kibuye. But -- they were stopped but, nevertheless, they were able to get through the first time and, finally, the doctor, the physician, saw that he was still ill and, therefore, told him, "The best thing would be for you to go back home, and I don't know whether it was a vehicle -- ordinary vehicle or an ambulance". But the witness -- the driver said under what circumstance he was forced to take back Nors to his house in Rubengera. Nors was taken to be a Belgian, an accomplice of the Inkotanyis. You will see the testimony of Witness DC who saw -- or participated from far, it's true, in the death of Nors, and talked about how he was taken from the vehicle, taken into the bush and murdered. The motive of the crime is that <stage>(By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal)</stage> saw how Nors was taken into the bush, how he was killed, but that he did not see exactly how he died; but he saw how the armed attackers took him, took everything from him, took some of his clothes, and took him to the bush and killed him with clubs.</p>
